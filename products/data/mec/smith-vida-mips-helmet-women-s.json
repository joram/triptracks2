  "description": "<p>More than \"just a helmet\", this one looks good and is incredibly comfortable. The light weight construction combines with a fit system that offers next-level comfort to make you likely to forget you're even wearing it... until you walk into apr\u00e8s-ski. Lots of ventilation keeps you cool on warm days, and you can block a few vents on snowy days to keep you warm. The MIPS liner is designed to reduce the rotational forces applied to your head, should you take a spill.</p><ul><li>Aerocore\u2122 construction featuring Koroyd\u00ae is designed to absorb more impact than traditional helmets</li><li>MIPS helps reduce rotational forces in the event of a crash</li><li>Adjustable AirEvac\u2122 venting lets you control airflow</li><li>VaporFit\u2122 dial adjusts easily for a comfortable fit</li><li>XT2\u00ae anti-bacterial liner manages odour</li><li>Removable ear pads</li><li>Side release buckle for glove-friendly on/off</li><li>Audio compatible</li></ul>",
