  "description": "<p>Full coverage and warmth for small skiers and riders who want to play outside in wind or wet snow (because wet snow is the best building snow). This classic one-piece suit offers warmth and weather protection when there's fun to be had in fall and winter. Redesigned for 2018 based on member feedback, the Toaster Suit is now waterproof and tougher than ever. Durable waterproof fabric helps them stay warm and dry through hours in the snow, and it's abrasion-resistant to stand up to the demands of serious play. The suit has room for layers and a hem that can be let down to accommodate growth, then (if you need it) tacked up again to ready it for the next kid in line.</p><ul><li>Shell is abrasion-resistant 150-denier 2-layer polyester with a polyurethane waterproof-breathable laminate and a DWR (durable water repellent) finish.
