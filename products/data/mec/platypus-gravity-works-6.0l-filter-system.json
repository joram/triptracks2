  "description": "<p>Hang this gravity-fed water filtration system at basecamp and get 6L of clean water in less than 3.5 minutes. The replaceable filters remove sediment, bacteria and cysts to give you safe water in the backcountry.</p><ul><li>Hollow fibre filter has a high surface-area that allows water to flow quickly through a 0.2 micron effective pore size</li><li>Nominal 1500L filter life is for clear water, turbidity will reduce the useful life of any filter</li><li>Maintain a high flow rate in the field by holding the clean water reservoir above the unfiltered reservoir. No disassembly required</li><li>Clearly labeled reservoirs are made of silver ion-treated polyethylene film that doesn't pick up tastes</li><li>Quick-disconnect valve automatically cuts the flow of water when the hose is disconnected</li><li>Clip-style shut-off valve on output hose between reservoirs</li></ul>",
