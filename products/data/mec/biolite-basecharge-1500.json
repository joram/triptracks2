  "description": "<p>Building that off-the-grid cabin just got easier. Whether you are looking to use power tools in the middle of nowhere, or just bring movie night \u2013 complete with popcorn and cold drinks, to van life, the BaseCharge 1500 has the power you need. With years of creating clever off-grid power solutions and powerbanks, BioLite has created a line of all-in-one power station that lets you plug-in your favourite at home electronics, wherever you roam. The onboard digital display provides you with all the information you need: input/output Watts, battery capacity, runtimes, charge times, and more. Wireless charging and tons of female charging ports, including 12V (car cigarette lighter), 3 x USB type C (one is even set-up for USB-PD), 2 x USB type A, and 3 x AC that accepts grounded and ungrounded plugs, mean that if you can recharge it, you can probably recharge it with the BaseCharge.</p><ul><li>LCD power status display tells you how much power you're getting and using, as well as battery charge capacity and time remaining under current load.
