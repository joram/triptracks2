  "description": "<p>The most advanced bike trainer available. Powerful, accurate and realistic. The Tacx Neo 2T have been improved again, with redesigned magnets, making your training experience even quieter with less sway. Full pedal stroke analysis lets you measure your left and right leg power individually. The road surface simulation blurs the line between virtual and real rides so you can really feel the cobblestones of Paris-Roubaix. As it's a direct-drive trainer, you don\u2019t need to think about slippage or calibration. The Neo 2T is the strong but silent type, so you can ride when your kids or dogs are still snoozing. It links with the usual bike app suspects, so you can cruise and compete with friends (or foes).</p><ul><li>Direct drive trainer accounts for every Watt you generate</li><li>Magnetic trainer provides predictable, consistent linear increase in resistance</li><li>Power reading accuracy of 1% ensures maximum precision</li><li>Maximum brake power of 2200W</li><li>Virtual flywheel ensures you get a realistic simulation based on your weight and the course you're riding</li><li>Road feel replicates cobblestones, cement plates, gravel roads and other surfaces</li><li>Road feel and downhill drive won't be available when used without external power</li><li>Cassette body fits Shimano and SRAM 8-12 speed cassettes.
