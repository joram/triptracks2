  "description": "<p>We've all said it: I wish I didn't need to get out of the sleeping bag. Wish no more! The Selk'bag is one part sleeping bag and one part puffy onesie, with separate legs and arms so you can go straight from the air mattress to making coffee. Elastic hand enclosures seal out drafts (like those on infant snow suits, but adult-sized), and removable booties let you slip into sturdier footwear while still wearing your bag. The fabric, insulation and zippers are made from 54 discarded plastic bottles, helping to reduce waste and make a more sustainable planet.</p><ul><li>150gsm recycled hollow-fibre insulation mimics down clusters for high warmth to weight</li><li>Insulated and adjustable hood can be worn up like a mummy bag or down like a barrel bag</li><li>Two-way zipper allows access to pants pockets without having to remove sleeping bag</li><li>Elastic hand closures seal out drafts</li><li>Zip-off booties have nylon bottoms for durability</li><li>Front kangaroo pocket keeps hands warm or small items safe</li><li>Print is an homage to the flora and fauna of the Patagonian jungle, through a partnership between Selk'bag and Parque Oncol in Chile</li></ul>",
