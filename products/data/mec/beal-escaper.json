  "description": "<p>No rope left behind. The Escaper lets you rappel a full rope length and then release the rope from the anchor, making it a solid backup in case your rap line becomes lost, stuck or damaged. Loop it through the anchor and back through itself, attach it to one end of your rope to create a strong hold, then descend normally. Once you're at the bottom, tug it free. Take it to the gym for a few practice runs before you head to the crag.</p><ul><li>Made of dry-treated nylon rope and Dyneema wrap</li><li>Fits in compact pouch for easy carrying</li><li>Recommended to familiarize yourself with its use in a controlled environment before using in a real world application</li></ul>",
