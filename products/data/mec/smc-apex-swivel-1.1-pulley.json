  "description": "<p>With 54 years behind its belt, SMC knows a thing or two about pulleys. With the triple action lock, you can open it with one hand and have peace of mind that it won\u2019t accidentally unlock. Add in its symmetrical side-plates and cold-forged swivel eye, and you\u2019ve got a burley pulley for setting up snatch blocks, hoisting a bear cache, or hauling gear.</p><ul><li>The stainless steel plates with an aluminum sheave make it durable and light where it counts</li><li>The custom designed swivel eye can take up to 3 carabiners and is rounded for you to setup in any scenario</li><li>The symmetrical side plates minimize mis-rigging and swing away to streamline your setup, so you can focus on the task at hand</li></ul>",
