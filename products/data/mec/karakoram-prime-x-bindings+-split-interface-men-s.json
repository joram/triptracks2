  "description": "<p>The Prime X Bindings are even lighter than before, without any compromise in stiffness and durability. Ideal for epic tours, hard-charging chutes in the backcountry and hitting the groomers, these bindings deliver an ideal combination of light weight with great stiffness. Designed to be as awesome as the boarder who rides them, these tried-and-true performance splitboard bindings are light and flexible. With the Prime X's minimal weight, you can expect the climb to be just as fun (ok, almost as fun!) as the descent.
