  "description": "<p>An iteration of the popular Tarantula shoe, the Tarantual Boulder has new features to help beginner climbers who focus on bouldering. The heel and toes have more rubber, and the heel is built slightly more aggressive, to help you stick to finicky heel and toe hooks. A half-length sole provides more sensitivity, and makes it easy to have resoled once you've worn through the rubber. It has the same sticky FriXion rubber as the other Tarantula's, providing support and grip on both plastic and rock foot holds.</p><ul><li>Unlined leather uppers are comfortable for sessions in the boulders and long hours in the gym</li><li>Slightly asymmetric shape balances comfort and performance</li><li>1.1mm full-length LaspoFlex midsole balances support and sensitivity</li><li>Slingshot heel with plenty of rubber for secure heel hooks</li><li>Rubber toe cap provides grip when toe hooking</li><li>Long lasting sticky FriXion\u00ae RS rubber sticks to plastic and rock equally well</li><li>La Sportiva suggests downsizing 1-1.5 sizes (performance fit) or 0.5-1 sizes (comfort fit) from your street shoe size</li></ul>",
