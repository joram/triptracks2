  "description": "<p>Let Garmin watch your 6. The RTL515 taillight gives your bike radar for what's coming up behind you. Using ANT+ or Bluetooth\u00ae Smart to talk to your Edge or your phone, the RTL515 displays approaching cars on the screen. The powerful LED makes sure that drivers are aware of you. Great for long rides on quiet roads where you might need the RTL515 to snap you back to the reality of an approaching vehicle. When riding busy streets, the radar will tell you what you already know \u2013 you\u2019re surrounded by cars, but you can still use it as a standalone bike light. In light only mode, you can control the unit from your paired device, or with the 1-button control on the light itself.</p><ul><li>Bluetooth Smart and ANT+ communication to your compatible Garmin device, other Bluetooth compatible computer (ELEMNT\u2122 series, HammerHead\u2122, etc.), or phone with Garmin Connect app (or other 3rd party apps) allows your speed to control your light</li><li>Colour coded approaching vehicle display, green shows you're in the clear, yellow indicates a car at a normal speed, red when a car is approaching quickly</li><li>Display minimizes when no cars are around, for a full screen view of your Edge unit.
