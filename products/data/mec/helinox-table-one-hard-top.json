  "description": "<p>Helinox took their original packable table and added a hardtop, so it works better for cooking and outdoor dining. It uses the same pole technology as their high-end chairs and is compact enough to fit in a fully-packed car or canoe. Sturdy, but not designed to use as a seat.</p><ul><li>Uses a single shockcord aluminum pole</li><li>Max load is 50kg, or about 146 cans of beer</li><li>Storage sack with zipper closure and grab handles</li></ul>",
