  "description": "<p>Blurring the line between pack and suitcase, the Tribute is a no-compromise solution for travellers. A wishbone wire frame transfers weight efficiently to your hips, and makes it versatile enough for trails and all-day exploring. A travel cover fully encloses the pack and suspension system, but has a zipper \u2013 with lockable pulls \u2013 for access to the straps. At 55L, it's a convenient size for extended get-aways when you want one bag to adapt to the situation.</p><ul><li>Made of 210-denier nylon with a water-resistant polyester lining</li><li>Lightweight perimeter wishbone frame distributes weight evenly to hips</li><li>Perforated foam with moisture-wicking mesh on body contact points for cooling</li><li>Foam padding on the exterior protects your pack in transport</li><li>When the zip-off daypack is removed, the base is carry-on sized for most airlines</li><li>All-round zip opens up entirely like a suitcase</li><li>Zippered, odour-resistant, waterproof compartment for dirty shoes or wet clothing</li><li>Top zippered pocket for essentials</li><li>Waterproof, seam-taped travel cover keeps your stuff dry and protected</li><li>Internal zippered quick-access security pocket</li><li>Padded handles on three sides,</li><li>Integrated safety whistle on sternum strap</li><li>Ergonomically shaped zipper pulls</li><li>Max recommended load is 20.5kg</li></ul>",
