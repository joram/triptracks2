  "description": "<p>One of Bor\u00e9al\u2019s top selling boats, the Epsilon is a reliable, controllable and fun kayak for paddlers of all skill levels. Outfitted with multiple storage hatches and sealed bulkheads this touring boat has plenty of room for your gear. A fully padded, adjustable seat keeps you comfy on long paddles. And should a little water get in the cockpit, the seat is perforated and dries quickly, so you won\u2019t end up sitting in a puddle. Even fully loaded the Epsilon series tracks well and slices through the water with ease.</p><ul><li>Light and strong polyethylene construction</li><li>High bow line reduces incoming spray when you\u2019re breaking waves</li><li>Durable rubber hatches seal out the water to keep your gear dry</li><li>Day hatch keeps your precious cargo close</li><li>Waterproof sealed bulkheads for easy storage and hull rigidity</li><li>Bungee cargo nets keep needed gear close, or charts in place</li><li>High visibility deck lines help keep you seen on low-light paddles</li><li>Paddler-side line lets you raise or lower the rudder without having to turn to face the rear deck</li><li>Molded paddle rest in front of the cockpit</li><li>Padded thigh braces and seat</li><li>Back pad acts like a backband offering solid support for your lower back</li><li>Adjustable footrests</li><li>Soft chines mean predictable and controllable tracking</li><li>Self-rescue straps help get you back in the boat</li></ul>",
