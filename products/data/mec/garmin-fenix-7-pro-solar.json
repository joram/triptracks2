  "description": "<p>Go for a backpacking trip, run an ultra, or do a couple triathlons, all on a single charge. Equipped with Garmin\u2019s efficient Power Glass, the f\u0113nix 7 Pro uses the power of the sun to make regular charging a thing of the past. When using the muti-band GPS, Garmin\u2019s SatIQ technology optimizes power usage.
