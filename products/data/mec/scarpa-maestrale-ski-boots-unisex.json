  "description": "<p>These boots are made for shredding the hardest, steepest backcountry lines. A reinforced ski/walk mechanism with two-buckle cuff is robust and combines touring efficiency with the stiffness needed for faultless downhill performance. The unique Alpine Axial Evo tongue is designed for easy touring and easy entry, and it offers a bit more forward flex than a regularly styled tongue. The Maestrale features a Recco\u00ae reflector in the power strap, which can be located by rescue crews at many ski areas. Tech fittings and a stiff Intuition liner round out this hard-charging package.</p><ul><li>Pebax\u00ae Rnew shell and cuff provides downhill performance in a lightweight package</li><li>Axial alpine evo tongue is made of Pebax\u00ae Rnew and blends overlap and cabrio style entry</li><li>Wave closure system uses a self-equalizing cable and a single buckle for a secure fit</li><li>Heel retention strap keeps the heel locked in nicely for a blister-free tour</li><li>Intuition\u00ae Pro Flex Tour liner is thermoformable for a custom fit</li><li>Quickstep fittings and fitting indicator simplify the process of getting your boots on and off</li><li>Speedlock Plus ski/walk mechanism offers friction-free touring efficiency with downhill performance</li><li>Vibram\u00ae Cayman PRO sole has a smooth rubber toe and lugged rubber profile to reduce snow build up and provide grip</li><li>Recco\u00ae reflector in power strap can be detected by rescue crews in many ski areas.
