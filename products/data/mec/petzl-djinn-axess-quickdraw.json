  "description": "<p>An updated classic featuring the evolution of the Djinn carabiner and the STRING. Petzl has optimized the carabiner\u2019s inners, giving it a larger rope basket and runner end. These tweaks make mounting the draw easier, and it is more likely to stay exactly where you want it. The evolved STRING now does an even better job of keeping your carabiner in the right position. This durable and reliable draw is ready to rack up and get business done.</p><ul><li>Djinn biners: one straight, one bent</li><li>Larger rope basket and optimized runner end, all without making the carabiner any larger</li><li>Keylock snag-free nose design</li><li>Rope-end biner is equipped with a STRING protector that reduces twisting and helps to maintain the rope-end carabiner orientation</li><li>Available in 11, 17, or 25cm lengths</li></ul>",
