  "description": "<p>This versatile half rope is good for long routes, ice, or alpine. It provides a nice balance of strength and lightness, and the dry treatment handles wet and cold conditions, so your rope doesn't freeze into a stiff cable.</p><ul><li>Golden Dry treatment protects both sheath and core from water absorption and adds resistance to humidity and grit</li><li>Unicore construction bonds the sheath and core so there should never be any sheath slippage</li><li>Low impact force produces a nice, soft catch</li><li>Use in sets of 2, except for simple glacier travel</li><li>Beal plants a tree for every rope sold</li></ul>",
