  "description": "<p>Flats happen, even with tubeless tires. This little kit makes sealing up holes in your tire, nice and simple. Where the TPT-1 stands out from other tire plug tools is how you get the \u201cbacon strip\u201d to stay in the tire. By adding a simple sliding retainer, Park\u2019s TPT-1 lets you hold the plug in place while removing the tool from the tire, no more pulling the plug out with the tool.</p><ul><li>All in one design tucks nicely in saddle bags, hip packs, and jersey pockets</li><li>Sliding plug remover makes an easy job even easier</li><li>Includes 5 vulcanized rubber tire plugs</li><li>Dimensions: 8.9 x 2.7 x 4cm</li></ul>",
