  "description": "<p>CNC machined from a block of grade 5 titanium and topped with a domed sapphire crystal, wrapped with a hardened ceramic bezel, the Marq is the best GPS smartwatch that Garmin can make. Know where you\u2019re going, on the trail and on your fitness journey, the Marq gives you the power to live smarter. Built on the do-it-all Epix platform, you get everything you\u2019d expect Garmin\u2019s flagship to have. SatIQ tackles the challenge of balancing GPS power and battery life, automatically matching your signal to your environment. The onboard multiband GPS pulls in speed, distance, and location data. While the optical heart rate monitor and other sensors pay attention to how you train. When your runs feel too easy, the Marq shows you why, breaking down the evolution of your running power and endurance. Each morning you are greeted with your morning report. This provides a summary of sleep quality, recovery level, training effects, and a personalized daily workout. When you need extra information, or motivation, you can download training plans through Garmin Connect. And, classic smartwatch features help you stay connected, stream music, receive notifications, track the weather and more.</p><ul><li>Grade 5 titanium case is more durable than the grade 4, used on the f\u0113nix and Epix lines</li><li>Sapphire crystal face and ceramic bezel are virtually scratchproof</li><li>Bezel features indices to track VO2 max and recovery time</li><li>AMOLED touchscreen has deep blacks and vibrant colours</li><li>Built-in activity modes for biking, running, walking, multisport, swimming (indoor and outdoor), gym activities, skiing (2000+ ski resort maps), golf (preloaded with 43,000 courses) and more</li><li>Activity animations guide you through proper form for strength training, cardio, Pilates and yoga</li><li>Multi-band signal reception and expanded GNSS support (GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, QZSS and IRNSS) provide faster and more accurate positioning and elevation data</li><li>SatIQ\u2122 matches your environment with the right GPS mode; flat land gets a low power signal, head into the mountains and your signal is boosted</li><li>Jetlag advisor predicts jetlag effects based on number of time zones crossed and offers suggestions to minimize the impact</li><li>Free TopoActive maps provide turn-by-turn directions in the city, and features like Nextfork\u2122 keep you on track in the backcountry</li><li>Internet Live Tracking during activities (via a phone) shares your location and metrics</li><li>Round-trip mapping: enter a distance and data from other Garmin users is used to calculate multiple course options that start and stop right were you are</li><li>Trendline\u2122 routing uses Garmin Connect\u2019s database of routes and finds the most popular way to get you where you are going</li><li>Hill score displays your running strength and endurance, tracking your progress over time</li><li>Endurance score maps improvements to your overall endurance</li><li>Morning report summarizes sleep quality, recovery level, training effects, and provides a personalized daily workout</li><li>Training readiness, training status, and training load modes use data from your recent workouts to let you know how ready your body is to train, and if you are overtraining, under-training, or on the right path</li><li>Running dynamics info provides running power, cadence, stride length, vertical oscillation, vertical ratio and ground contact time</li><li>ClimbPro\u2122 mode breaks down the climbs in your activity, letting you know the grade, the total ascent, how much more you have to go</li><li>Elevate\u2122 v.4 optical heart rate monitor provides constant heart rate and pulse ox data</li><li>Physiological metrics includes VO2 max, acute load, race predictor, recovery advisor, real-time stamina tracking, and performance indicator</li><li>Heart rate variability (HRV) is used to predict recovery and training response</li><li>Body Battery\u2122 tracks daily energy levels, monitoring what drains your energy (exercise) and recharges your energy (rest, food)</li><li>Stream music via a paired phone using Spotify, Deezer, or Amazon Music.
