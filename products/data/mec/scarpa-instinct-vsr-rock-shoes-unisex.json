  "description": "<p>A supple shoe that's designed for lighter climbers. They are sensitive enough for working steep sport routes and for training sessions on overhanging walls. They have good rubber coverage that lends itself to involved footwork and tricky hooking tactics. Bi-tensioned randing system keeps your weight centered over the toe, but doesn't cram your foot forward.</p><ul><li>Durable synthetic micro-suede uppers</li><li>Rubber toe patch provides toe-scumming and hooking power</li><li>Slightly asymmetric, curved shape for precise foot placement</li><li>Flexan 1.0mm midsole for support</li><li>Vibram XS Grip2 rubber is designed to grip through friction moves</li><li>Members typically downsize 1-1.5 sizes (performance fit) or 0.5-1 sizes (comfort fit) from their street shoe size</li></ul>",
