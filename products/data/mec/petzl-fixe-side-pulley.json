  "description": "<p>The Fixe replaces the Petzl\u00ae Fixed Side Pulley, and offers a well-considered balance of weight and strength. Designed for hauling systems, it\u2019s heavier, more durable and stronger than the very lightest pulleys, but not as burly as a rescue pulley. This model features thinner, stronger side plates, which eliminate the need for the weight-reducing holes that were on the old version, so the system has a cleaner design.</p><ul><li>Aluminum side plates</li><li>Self-lubricating bushings</li><li>Fixed side plates allow quick installation and coupling with a rope clamp</li><li>For ropes 7-13mm</li><li>Breaking strength is 23kN</li></ul>",
