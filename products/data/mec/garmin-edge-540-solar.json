  "description": "<p>In a world where something always needs charging, wouldn\u2019t it be nice if your Edge didn\u2019t? By incorporating efficient solar technology into these Edge units, Garmin lets you spend more time riding and less time charging. Building on GPS technology from the Fenix line, the latest Edge computers give you access to more satellites and more signals than ever before. These updates give you a stronger GPS connection anywhere you ride, from forests, to valleys of glass and steel. Free detailed maps provide turn-by-turn directions to local points of interest, so if there is gelato close by, you\u2019ll find it. Garmin has incorporated their popularity routing into the latest map set, letting you ride the local\u2019s favourite roads and trails, anywhere you go. Pre-loaded with TrailForks, you get access to incredible trail maps right on your Edge. Real-time Strava segment integration displays nearby segments, showing how you compare to your PR and the current KOM or QOM. And if you\u2019re the \u201cnever enough data\u201d type, you can pair your Edge to a range of additional sensors to optimize your time in the saddle.
