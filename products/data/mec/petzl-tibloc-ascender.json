  "description": "<p>Simplicity often yields the best results. This simple taco-shaped piece of metal is really a cam that can lock over a rope and press it against a carabiner. The result is the lightest weight emergency ascender you can buy. Superb for crevasse rescue and hauling, or running along a fixed rope back up on slopes. The angled teeth and self-cleaning slot securely grip your rope, even in muddy or icy conditions.</p><ul><li>Please note that the Tibloc is for emergency or occasional use only and care must be taken to engage the cam correctly</li><li>Use with ropes 8 to 11mm</li><li>CE certified</li></ul>",
