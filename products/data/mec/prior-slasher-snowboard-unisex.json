  "description": "<p>The Slasher is the ride for powder connoisseurs heading out on snorkel-deep days. The long effective edge and swallowtail design means you can ride a slightly shorter board (3 to 5cm) that's flickable in tight trees. The long pow nose, early rise and powder rocker keep you floating on top all day. Traditional camber in the tail gives it power to drive off the back foot. Rubber foil dampening smooths out the ride when you're railing, and the laminated woodcore give it playful responsiveness to ride wide chutes and big open bowls.</p><ul><li>Sublimated nylon topsheet brings durability and keeps your board looking sharp</li><li>Tri glass construction for a responsive, torsionally stiff feel</li><li>Vertically laminated aspen and poplar woodcore</li><li>Powder nose features a long early rise and is combined with a traditional camber underfoot and a short, shallow tail</li><li>15mm taper makes for a directional ride that floats like no other</li><li>Durable, impact-resistant UHMW polyethylene sidewalls</li><li>Durasurf 4001 sintered base is fast and very durable</li></ul>",
