The micro-adjustable trigger ledges and generously sized pommels on the shaft allow you swift, smooth matching, regardless of your hand size.</p><ul><li>Hot-forged aluminum shaft with a gold-resistant polymer overlay</li><li>Adjustable handle can be moved between 100-105 degrees</li><li>Modular head allows you to change pick or add a hammer or adze when necessary (sold separately)</li><li>Includes Mixte pick.
