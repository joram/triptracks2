  "description": "<p>Fall and winter rides can be some of the best, there are less people on the trails and hero dirt under your tires, but it is not all good. Cold rides often mean cold toes, and it\u2019s never fun trying to stuff 2 pairs of socks into your riding shoes, so let Fizik\u2019s Terra Nanuq shoes protect you from the elements. Insulated with a plush fleece lining and insole, these shoes help you hold onto your hard earned heat, while wicking away moisture. On those days where it seems like as much water is splashing back up at you, as is falling on you, the waterproof breathable GORE-TEX lining neoprene cuffs are easy to love. And the Boa fit system gives you a great fit at the turn of a dial, even with gloves on.</p><ul><li>GORE-TEX\u00ae uppers are waterproof and breathable</li><li>Zippered neoprene cuff is easy to get on and off and provides gaiter-like weather protection</li><li>Boa\u00ae L6 ratchet cable system allows for a custom fit that is easy to adjust over long rides</li><li>Graduated cleat box makes set up simple</li><li>TPU overlay rand adds durability in high wear areas</li><li>X2 nylon and rubber outsole balances stiffness and grip</li><li>Vibram\u2122 XS Trek EVO lugged tread offers great grip off the bike and during those hike-a-bike moments</li></ul>",
