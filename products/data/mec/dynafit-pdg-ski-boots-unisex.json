  "description": "<p>A performance boot ideal for skimo racing and high-intensity training. Closely related to  high-end race boots, the PDG is a slightly heavier yet equally agile iteration. The Grilamid shell features a stiff fibreglass cuff to help drive your skis. Rubber soles provide traction on non-snow surfaces, while the rock-solid ski/walk mechanism allows for easy changes from ski to walk mode. The 2 buckle system features an optional power strap for close contact on high-performance days. While the liner provides some moisture management and insulation, these boots lack shell coverings in the upper sections, so are susceptible to moisture when booting through big snow.</p><ul><li>Grilamid shell features a solid fibreglass cuff and Grilamid spoiler</li><li>2-buckle design features an optional power strap for increased contact between boot and leg</li><li>Ultra-Lock System 1.0 ski/walk mechanism switches from ski to walk cleanly and quickly</li><li>Evo Race 2.0 rubber soles are super grippy and lightweight</li><li>Dynafit Custom Light liners are thermomoldable for a customized fit and provide moderate insulation and moisture management</li></ul>",
