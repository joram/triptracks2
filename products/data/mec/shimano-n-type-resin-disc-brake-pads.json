  "description": "<p>Replacement pads and springs for Shimano disc brakes. Updated with a new resin compound, these pads last up to 50% longer than the previous generation. Compared to metal pads, the resin compound is quiet, generates less heat, and offers more progressive stopping power (no sudden braking). The only compromise? Resin has a shorter lifespan than metal, especially under wet conditions.</p><ul><li>Finned Ice Technologies pulls heat away from the pads, reducing brake fade</li><li>3rd generation resin compound lasts 90% longer than 1st generation and 50% longer than 2nd generation</li><li>Comes with 1 left and 1 right pad, and 1 spring for 1 set of brakes</li><li>To replace both front and rear brakes, you will require 2 sets of these brake pads</li><li>Fits 4-piston SLX, XTR, and XT calipers</li><li>Compatible with XTR M9100 series, DEORE XT M8100 series, SLX M7100 series, CUES U8000 series</li></ul>",
