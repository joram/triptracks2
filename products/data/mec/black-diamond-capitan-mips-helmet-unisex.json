  "description": "<p>Big wall worthy protection. The Capitan's mix of foam cushions your head from falling objects, with side and back coverage that meets UIAA helmet requirements.  In the event of an impact to the helmet, MIPS technology reduces the rotational forces to your head, helping prevent brain injury more effectively than your average climbing helmet. The hardtop shell protects your head against punctures and the foam against abrasion, and the 2-piece construction creates a unique dual-colour design.</p><ul><li>Made of expanded polypropylene and expanded polystyrene, which has a high rate of energy absorption</li><li>MIPS technology reduces rotational forces to the head in the event of an impact, lessening the potential damage to the brain</li><li>2-piece ABS shell provides scuff and impact protection</li><li>Increased coverage on back and sides for additional protection</li><li>Comfort pads are removable for washing</li><li>Lightweight adjustment system for a secure fit</li><li>Front hooks and rear elastic hold a headlamp</li></ul>",
