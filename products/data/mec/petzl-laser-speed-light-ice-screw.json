  "description": "<p>Shave weight, move fast. The tubes of these screws are aluminum with steel drilling tips. The teeth are designed to bite in about a quarter turn, so you can get your screws started rapidly. Integrated cranks apply efficient leverage to wind them in with one hand even at awkward angles. A smallish hanger is easier to place in sculpted ice, but big enough to grip with gloves or cold fingers.</p><ul><li>Ultralight anodized aluminum tubes with stainless steel drilling tips.
