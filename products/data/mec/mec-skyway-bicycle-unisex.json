  "description": "<p>The Skyway is back! Like all single speeds, it's a different sort of bike that rolls through the urban hullabaloo without fuss or fanciness. The steel frame is stiff, rigid and has great handling so you can navigate around potholes, roots, or squirrels that dash out between parked cars. Reliable and easy to maintain, the design uses a freewheel that makes coasting and casual rides that much more joyful. Add on some fenders and a rack and your Skyway becomes the ultimate everyday cruiser for riding in the rain or bringing your picnic basket to the beach.</p><ul><li>MEC chromoly frame is stiff, rigid and has great handling</li><li>Single speed drivetrain with freewheel is durable, reliable and easy to maintain</li><li>Alex rims with Kenda tires roll smoothly and softly</li><li>Track pedals have classic clips and straps</li><li>Attachments for fenders, racks or baskets convert this classic ride into a grocery transporter or picnic-mobile</li><li>Bikes are covered by MEC's Rocksolid Guarantee and Bike Service Agreement. You can bring your bike to any MEC bike shop for free adjustments and minor maintenance for a year after purchase</li><li>MEC bikes were designed in Canada. Everything from the frames to the graphics was developed at the MEC Head Office in Vancouver, BC</li><li>Due to challenges with supply chain, components may be substituted for comparable parts at any time. The listed build is how MEC intended your bike to arrive, though the manufacturer may need to make a tweak or two to get you riding sooner</li></ul>",
