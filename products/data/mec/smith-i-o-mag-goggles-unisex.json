  "description": "<p>Super-stylish and radically functional. Upgraded with Smith\u2019s MAG lens changing system, the I/O Mag Goggles make swapping lenses even easier. The rimless design keeps the lens readily accessible and not tucked within a frame, so you can switch lenses quickly when conditions change after lunch.</p><ul><li>Designed for medium faces</li><li>MAG lens changing system combines 8 N52 magnets with a lens carrier locking mechanism. Adding a locking carrier to the MAG system prevents the lens from experiencing any rotational shift and adds an extra measure of retention over magnets alone. A simple push of one lever at either side of the lens releases the lens for easy swapping</li><li>ChromaPop\u00ae lenses deliver exceptional clarity, high contrast and dynamic colour optimization, making them great for challenging light conditions</li><li>Spherical Carbonic-X lens has crisp TLT optics and a 5X anti-fog inner lens</li><li>Thermal lens with Porex\u2122 pressure-equalizing filter eliminates distortion and fog during rapid elevation changes</li><li>Smith\u2019s Responsive Fit\u2122 design makes the frame very flexible without losing strength, allowing it to adjust to contours of a variety of face shapes while reducing weight</li><li>Articulating outrigger system allows for comfortable, pressure-free wear, with or without a helmet</li><li>3-layer DriWix foam provides a comfortable, breathable seal</li><li>Wide, silicone backed strap has a quick-fit adjustment system and a clip buckle</li><li>Includes a spare ChromaPop Storm Rose with 50% visible light transmission</li><li>Includes an extra lens and a microfibre goggle bag</li></ul>",
