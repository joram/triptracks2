  "description": "<p>The ideal line for working big routes. Developed with help from Tommy Caldwell, it has a high sheath proportion (40%), so it's a workhorse option for heavy projecting, big walls, route development or any situation where your rope takes a beating. UIAA certified EcoDry treatment absorbs less than 2% of it's weight in water, so it stays light and is less susceptible to freezing in wet, cold conditions.</p><ul><li>Duo Tec pattern change at halfway point makes it easy to find the middle</li><li>Thermo Shield treatment gives it excellent handling properties, a supple feel and an impressive strength rating</li><li>EcoDry finish makes this rope durably water-repellent and dirt-resistant without the use of PFCs</li><li>3D lap coiled so you can use it straight away without kinking or tangling</li><li>Meets UIAA standard water-repellent test, meaning this rope is fast-drying, absorbs virtually no water and resists freezing</li></ul>",
