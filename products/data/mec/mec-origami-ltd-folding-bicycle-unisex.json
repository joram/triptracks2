It does everything you love about a folding bike: stows in a closet, packs into your micro-car or your boat, goes on the train, and fits under your desk \u2013 all at an economy price. If you're an occasional multi-modal commuter or need a bike for just now-and-again use, this is a very accessible option.</p><ul><li>Lightweight aluminum frame folds with durable centre hinge</li><li>Tern V-brakes are powerful and easy to maintain</li><li>Adjusts to fit riders from 147 to 188cm (4ft. 10in. to 6ft. 2in.) supports a max weight of 105kg (230lb.)</li><li>7-speed gearing accommodates most urban topography</li><li>For transport, seat post telescopes into the frame, handlebars telescope and fold flat and pedals fold against the crank</li><li>Kenda K-193 20 x 1.5in. tires provide plenty of cushioning</li><li>Folded size is approximately 34 x 67 x 64cm</li><li>Integral rear rack keeps packs and cargo off your back</li><li>Included fenders for rainy day riding</li><li>Note: Bikes are covered by MEC's Rocksolid Guarantee and Bike Service Agreement.
