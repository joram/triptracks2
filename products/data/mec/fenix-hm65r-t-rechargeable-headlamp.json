  "description": "<p>By upgrading the LEDs and adding their new lightweight strap to the HM65R, Fenix has made a great light even better. This versatile headlamp gives you both flood and spotlighting with independently controlled LEDs. The 3 spotlight modes and 3 floodlight modes can be used on their own or together. Read in the tent, work on a job or ride a couple laps with darkness-melting 1700 lumens. The internal battery is easily charged via an integrated USB-C port, or use the lithium 123A batteries when you're away from USB ports.</p><ul><li>Wider headband now uses a ratcheting dial to find that perfect fit. The increased width disperses the headlamp\u2019s weight comfortably, and combined with the ratcheting closure, keeps your beam steadier when on the run</li><li>Cast from lightweight magnesium, the body is lighter and has improved cooling over aluminum</li><li>6 modes, 3 in spotlight: high (4h at 1300 lumens), medium (12h at 400 lumens), low (24h at 55 lumens), 3 in floodlight: high (12h at 400 lumens), medium (33h at 70 lumens and low (300h at 5 lumens)</li><li>2 lenses and modes: 1 for spot and 1 for flood, each can be used independently or together</li><li>Powered by 18650 rechargeable battery or 2 CR123A batteries</li><li>Integrated USB-C port charges internal 18650 battery fast</li><li>4-level power indicator</li><li>2-sided switch controls independent or combined modes</li><li>Lockout mode prevents light from being switched on inside your pack</li><li>Ratcheting tilt housing tilts up to 60\u00b0</li><li>Light housing has an integrated partial button cover, protecting the silicone buttons</li><li>Perforated, reflective headband wicks away sweat and helps keep you seen</li><li>IPX6 waterproofing means your light is ready for any weather</li><li>In the box: HM65R-T, head strap, 18650 ARB-L18-3500 3500mAh battery, spare battery compartment O-ring, USB-C cable, manual and warranty card</li></ul>",
