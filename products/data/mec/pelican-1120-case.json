  "description": "<p>Long the standard-issue protection for cameras, radios, and other delicate equipment. Canoeists and kayakers love Pelican Cases for keeping cameras easily accessible, yet utterly safe and secure. Because they are fully watertight they are also airtight. This case has an automatic pressure equalization valve to equalize the interior air pressure, so its easier to open after flying or climbing.</p><ul><li>Made of lightweight structural foam resin that won\u2019t dent, crack, or corrode. Light enough to float unless you\u2019re carrying fossils or a fortune in gold</li><li>Sturdy gasket around the rim makes them watertight</li><li>Removable pick-n-pluck foam is perforated into cubes, so you can customize snug compartments for your gear</li><li>Both the Pelican warranty and MEC's Rocksolid Guarantee cover this case itself. Neither guarantee covers the contents you put inside the case</li></ul>",
