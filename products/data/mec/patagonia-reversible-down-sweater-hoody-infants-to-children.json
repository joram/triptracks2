  "description": "<p>When the wind blows and snow starts to fall, a sweater with 600-fill power down is an instant cloud of warmth. A DWR-treated shell seals out wetness (or spilled juice). The insulated hood has an elastic binding that snugs in close to keep out drafts and keep little outdoor beans happy through the winter months. When a style change-up is in order, it's totally reversible from a solid fabric to a pattern.</p><ul><li>Shell is recycled polyester ripstop with a DWR (durable water repellent) finish to keep it water-resistant and windproof</li><li>Lining is polyester plain weave with a DWR finish</li><li>Insulated with high-loft premium 600-fill power Traceable Down from ducks that were never live plucked or force fed</li><li>Sewn through construction keeps down compartmentalized and prevents clumping</li><li>Insulated hood has soft elastic binding</li><li>Full-length, centre-front zip</li><li>Zippered handwarmers on solid side and simple on-seam pockets on the print side keep little paws warm</li><li>Elastic sleeve cuffs seal out clouds of powder</li></ul>",
