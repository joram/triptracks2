  "description": "<p>If you are finding that sunglasses aren't providing all the protection you want, try the Shore goggles. Ride tight trees and rubble strewn paths with these super-vented goggles. Intake vents move warm air off the lenses, and, like thermal windows on a house, the dual lens helps with temperature changes that can cause fogging. Broad lens allows good peripheral and downward vision.</p><ul><li>Dual layer polycarbonate lens has tear-away posts</li><li>Face foam is comfortable and hypoallergenic</li><li>Flexible frame fits a variety of face shapes</li><li>Intake vents keep your vision clear and lenses free of fog</li><li>Silicone-ribbed strap stays in place</li><li>Design is helmet compatible</li></ul>",
