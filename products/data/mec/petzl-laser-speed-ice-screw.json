  "description": "<p>Bites fast and chews in quick. The shape of the drilling teeth is designed to bite in about a quarter turn, so you can get your screws started rapidly. The integrated crank applies efficient leverage to wind them in with one hand even at awkward angles. A smallish hanger is easier to place in sculpted ice, but big enough to grip with gloves or cold fingers.</p><ul><li>Shaft is treated stainless steel, hanger is aluminum</li><li>Colour-coded cranking handles make identification easier</li><li>Swivelling crank on the hanger allows fast placement and removal</li><li>Sharpening reserve on the teeth helps with filing</li></ul>",
