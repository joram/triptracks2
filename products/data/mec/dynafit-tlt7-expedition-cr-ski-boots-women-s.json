  "description": "<p>An innovative ski mountaineering boot that does more with less. Dynafit\u2019s TLT series improves yet again with the 7 Expedition. At 999g per boot, it's 180g lighter than its predecessor. The toe welt is gone from the toebox, moving the insert back 5mm, giving you a more natural stride. A single UltraLock 3.0 buckle opens, closes and adjusts at a micro level to shave more weight, improve boot durability (fewer snags and catches) and dial in your fit. The speed nose and set-back pivot point are tuned to conserve energy on the ascent and promote efficiency on long tours and ski mountaineering days.</p><ul><li>Lower shells, cuff and spoiler are Grilamid (polyamide) and carbon infused Grilamid for agility and walkability</li><li>Lambda frame acts as an exoskeleton to improve stiffness and power transfer without the addition of unecessary material</li><li>Forward lean is adjustable between 15 and 18 degrees</li><li>Speed nose offers a shortened toebox and rotation point to make walking even more efficient</li><li>UltraLock 3.0 system uses a single buckle to control the walk/ski mode</li><li>Micro-adjustability lower shell can remain tight, while the cuff is open for comfortable touring fit</li><li>Custom Light thermo-mouldable liner with anatomic construction, optional lacing system and closed cell insulation on the sole</li><li>Cuff rotation of 60 degrees ensures comfort and range of motion</li><li>Formula Pomoca outsole is mountaineering focussed so you have grip and traction on difficult terrain</li><li>Strong master step inserts allow a release value up to 16 without any modifications</li><li>Snow-dynamic design slides through powder and avoids lateral obstructions</li></ul>",
