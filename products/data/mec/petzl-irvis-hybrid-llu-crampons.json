  "description": "<p>The tried and true 10-point design is at home on glaciated terrain for ski touring missions or alpine climbing objectives. The aluminum heel-piece with the steel toe-piece makes it both light and durable. Steel bites into ice and won't wear quickly on rock and aluminum keeps the weight down. To make them lighter still, a Dyneema\u00ae cord links the front and the heel. Compatible with boots that have a heel welt, including ski mountaineering boots and lightweight mountaineering boots.</p><ul><li>Steel front piece provides great traction and durability</li><li>Aluminum heel piece keeps the weight low</li><li>Cord-tec light, ultra-strong Dyneema\u00ae connects front and heel pieces for a low-bulk, low-weight crampon</li><li>Leverlock universal binding fits all boots with a heel welt</li><li>FIL and FIL FLEX ensure compatibility with boots with or without toe welt</li><li>Fits boot sizes 36-46 (Optional replacement Cord-Tec allows for use with larger boot size.)</li><li>Comes with protective carry bag</li><li>Antisnow plate included</li><li>CE / UIAA certified</li></ul>",
