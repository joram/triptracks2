  "description": "<p>Could there be anything better than a headlamp that adjusts light output to the situation? We don't think so. Its integrated sensor analyzes and responds to reflected light. So when you start reading a map, the beam becomes soft and diffused. When you're moving, it uses a wide, mid-bright setting to show immediate obstacles. When you glance ahead, it brightens and narrows to let you pick out details.</p><ul><li>Equipped with both REACTIVE LIGHTING\u00ae (up to 1500 lumens) and standard (high: 900 lumens, medium: 250 lumens and low: 10 lumens) lighting modes</li><li>REACTIVE LIGHTING\u00ae customizes your headlamp\u2019s output to best match your current conditions, from how bright the light is, to what type of beam it uses</li><li>USB recharging makes it easy to charge your light on laptops, solar panels or battery banks</li><li>5-level battery status indicator lets you know how your battery is doing, both when charging or in use</li><li>IPX4 weather protection keeps your light shining in pouring rain</li><li>Stabilizing headband cradles the base of your head, improving comfort and beam stability</li><li>Quick and easy rear adjustment</li><li>Lock function keeps the light from turning on while in transit</li><li>10 lumen reserve mode runs for 2 hours, ensuring you don\u2019t get left in the dark</li><li>Red lighting, continuous or strobe lighting at the back of the headlamp to help keep you visible</li><li>Helmet strap and storage pouch included</li></ul>",
