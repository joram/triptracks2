  "description": "<p>Having the right tool for big days in the backcountry is key to having an efficient and enjoyable time. The MTN Explore 88 skis shine when you've got your skins on, but that doesn't mean they're noodles on the descent. Using some of the same technology found in the QST line, but with a focus on lightness. With C/FX carbon reinforcement and 3D-shaped karuba wood core, Salomon created a very responsive ski that's quick enough to get in an extra lap.</p><ul><li>Internally milled Karuba wood core offers great stability and rebound</li><li>Carbon layer and flax laminate keeps the weight low while increasing the ski's dampness</li><li>Spaceframe 2.0 construction at tip and tail to improve manoeuvrability</li><li>Sandwich construction features ABS sidewall all around the ski for increased durability and strength</li><li>Titanal insert edge to edge underfoot allows for maximum power transfer</li><li>5-point sidecut improves steering in mixed snow and feels quick and agile</li><li>Koroyd Tip is lightweight and reduces vibration without sacrificing control</li><li>Skin Clip Tail features a notch for an easy and secure skin attachment</li></ul>",
