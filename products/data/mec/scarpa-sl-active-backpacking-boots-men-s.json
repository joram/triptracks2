  "description": "<p>These boots are well-suited for extended adventures in sub-alpine terrain and other rugged trail systems. Flex zones and memory foam at the ankle keep your feet comfortable and secure when you're carrying a heavy pack. It's good to note that this is a more traditional design, constructed to last for many years, so it's advisable to schedule some break-in time with these boots. Once they've taken shape, they'll keep your feet happy for years to come.</p><ul><li>Uppers are Sherpa HS12 full-grain leather for maximum durability and classic visual appeal</li><li>37.5\u00ae lining moves sweat away from your feet</li><li>Full perimeter rubber rand protects the leather</li><li>Flex zone at the ankle adds comfort and a smoother break-in period</li><li>Memory foam ankle padding adapts to your foot for a secure fit</li><li>Dual-density polyurethane midsole has front and rear cushioning for a comfortable ride</li><li>TPU shank stabilizes feet on uneven terrain</li><li>Vibram\u00ae Biometric outsole is designed to let your foot roll naturally</li><li>Vibram XS Trek rubber and multi-directional lugs provide traction on steep and loose slopes</li></ul>",
