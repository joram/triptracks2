  "description": "<p>A spin on the classic adventure hat, the Tilley TH5 is made with natural and tough hemp. UPF 50+ protection shields your head when there's no shade in sight, and a broad brim and DWR finish keep you dry when storm clouds gather. A pocket in the crown holds extra cash for those times you don't want to wear a money belt. A well-designed dual cord system keeps it on your head, even in the face of gale-force winds, but if you happen to drop it overboard, the wide foam brim keeps it afloat until you can retrieve it.</p><ul><li>Durable hemp fabric has UPF 50+ sun protection and a DWR finish to shed light rain</li><li>Hydrofil\u00ae sweatband wicks moisture</li><li>Wide foam brim floats if dropped in water</li><li>Brim is 6.65cm at front, 7cm at back, and 5.5cm on the sides</li><li>Hidden crown pocket keeps small essentials safe while travelling</li><li>Dual cord system for security in gusty conditions</li></ul>",
