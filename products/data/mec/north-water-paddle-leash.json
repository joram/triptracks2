  "description": "<p>Carrying out rescues, snapping photos, taking a snack break, or adjusting your seat or foot pedals: there a lot of reasons you might want both hands free while at sea in a touring kayak. This leash lets you set your paddle down without it getting away. A hook-and-loop band wraps around the paddle shaft. At the other end, a clip hook attaches to deck webbing or D-rings. Note: Not recommended for whitewater kayaking due to the risk of entanglement.</p><ul><li>Bungi stretches to allow strokes and contracts to minimize tangling</li></ul>",
