  "description": "<p>Costing less than a year\u2019s worth of bus passes, our level 1 Midtown is here to make your commute a lot more fun. We have broken our entry-level urban bike out into a couple tiers, making a quality ride even more accessible. Built on a light and strong frame, the Midtown has a comfortable upright riding position that excels in urban environments. Mechanical disc brakes keep your speed right where you want it and are a real step up from rim brakes, especially on rainy days. The Midtown is easy to maintain and is a great refresher on the joy of cycling. Rack and fender mounts let you customize your ride and make it more useful. And the large-diameter wheels carry more momentum than standard 26in. mountain bike wheels, so you cruise right over bumps, rough pavement and unpaved side streets.</p><ul><li>Midtown frame uses 6000 series butted aluminum tubing, giving it an excellent strength to weight ratio</li><li>700 x 38mm high-volume tires help smooth out rough roads and can handle dirt roads, paths and light trail use</li><li>Tektro mechanical disc brakes work well in all weather conditions</li><li>Wide-ranging 8-speed microSHIFT and Shimano (Altus) drivetrain suits general city riding</li><li>Upright seated position and 15mm riser bars give you good visibility in traffic</li><li>Flat Wellgo pedals are easy to use in a wide rang of footwear, from business casual to flip-flops</li><li>Bikes are covered by MEC's Rocksolid Guarantee and Bike Service Agreement. You can bring your bike to any MEC bike shop for free adjustments and minor maintenance for a year after purchase</li><li>MEC bikes are designed in Canada. Everything from the frames to the graphics were developed at the MEC Head Office in Vancouver, BC</li><li>Due to challenges with supply chain, components may be substituted for comparable parts at any time. The listed build is how MEC intended your bike to arrive, though the manufacturer may need to make a tweak or two to get you riding sooner</li></ul>",
