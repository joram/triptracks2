  "description": "<p>Hard wearing trail shoes that feel like runners. Inspired by the sock-knit construction found on modern trainers, the Accomplice uses an innovative tongue to cradle your foot, resulting in some of the comfiest trail shoes on the market. Designed to work with 2-hole cleat, these shoes feel great clipped in and are impressively rigid, so your power goes right to the trail. Ride Concepts built these shoes to last, tough nylon uppers aren\u2019t afraid of rock gardens or even the odd pedal bite (better the shoe than you). The lugged rubber outsole offers great grip, which is nice to have when walking features, and the flat tread pattern works well for stomping down berms.</p><ul><li>Deep cleat box has a ramped entry and exit, making sure nothing gets between you and clipping in</li><li>Cleat box has index marking for dialing in the perfect cleat placement</li><li>Rugged nylon uppers dry quickly and let your feet breathe</li><li>4-way stretch slip tongue hugs your foot while keeping debris out</li><li>Suede reinforcement around the lace eyelets increase durability</li><li>Added TPU protection at the base of the shoe</li><li>Elastic lace pouch keeps your laces out of your drivetrain</li><li>Supportive dual-density EVA insole</li><li>Low-volume design with tailored padding around the heel and collar</li><li>Nylon shank adds stiffness for improved power transfer</li><li>Works with SPDs and Crank Brothers cleats</li><li>Deeply lugged sole with reverse lugs at the heel and toe for comfortable walking and traction while hike-a-biking</li></ul>",
