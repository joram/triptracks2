  "description": "<p>A superb entry-level bent shaft paddle with Redtail\u2019s Ergo handle for a more relaxed grip. The poplar and black cherry construction makes it lightweight and affordable. The eight-inch wide blade allows powerful strokes.</p><p>Bent shaft paddles are most appropriate for paddlers going in a straight line on flat water. Originally designed for racers, they help extend the power phase of your forward stroke. They work particularly well for bow paddlers who are primarily touring; they\u2019re less suitable for stern or solo paddlers, since the bent blade can be awkward for corrective and steering strokes. (For the same reason, even bow paddlers may carry a regular straight shaft paddle as their spare paddle, and switch to it when running moving water.)</p><ul><li>Resin tip for added durability</li></ul>",
