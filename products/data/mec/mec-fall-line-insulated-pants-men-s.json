  "description": "<p>Keep the focus on fresh lines, not winter chills. Waterproof and insulated, the Fall-Line Insulated Pants pairs mid-weight ThermoLite insulation with MEC's VarioShell membrane to keep you dry and warm on the slopes. Articulated construction and a gusseted crotch ensure unrestricted movement, whether you\u2019re skinning up or going for a tail grab. Polyester patches keep ski edges from scuffing inner legs and hems, and a Recco reflector adds piece of mind in case of emergency.</p><ul><li>2-layer recycled nylon shell with MEC's VarioShell waterproof-breathable membrane and critically taped seams</li><li>Shell has a durable water repellency finish (DWR) that sheds snow and repels light rain</li><li>60g ThermoLite T3 EcoMade medium loft insulation (85% recycled) has high warmth for it's weight</li><li>Recycled polyester lining glides over layers</li><li>Gusseted crotch and articulated knees allow full range of movement</li><li>Internal gaiters have grip elastic to cinch around boots and keep out snow</li><li>Built-in Recco\u00ae Rescue System reflector allows ski patrol and mountain rescue teams to detect and locate it</li></ul>",
