  "description": "<p>Light is right, but when it comes to an avalanche shovel, it also needs to be reliable. The Pro Light shovel only weighs 440g, and is extremely compact and functional. The shovel blade features cut-outs to bring the weight down by reducing the amount of material used. Grooves on the shaft keep the weight low without reducing stiffness.</p><ul><li>6061-T6 aluminum blade features notches and ridges to increase stifness while reducing weight</li><li>Telescoping shaft locks into place without fiddling with locking buttons</li><li>Small size fits perfectly in smaller packs</li><li>Shovel blade can be converted to a rescue sled for emergency evacuations</li></ul>",
