The touchscreen on the f\u0113nix 7 lets you choose between tapping, swiping or tried-and-true buttons. An efficient solar panel could make charging a thing of the past. Loaded with regional TopoActive maps, the f\u0113nix Sapphire Solar editions help you find your way or plan your route, at home or abroad.
