Resists corrosion</li><li>Upper connection hole guides the rope through the device and prevents twisting</li><li>Lower attachment hole is large enough for 2 carabiners</li><li>Accepts ropes 8-11mm</li><li>The device is not designed for self belaying or situations where it can be shock loaded</li></ul>",
