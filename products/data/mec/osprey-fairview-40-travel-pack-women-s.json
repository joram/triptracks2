  "description": "<p>A lightweight, carry-on-sized travel pack for minimalist globetrotters. The Fairview 40 meets most carry-on restrictions, with front compression straps to help you squeak by if it's a close call. The comfortable shoulder straps and hipbelt make it easy to shoulder your load, and they zip away behind a panel in case you're forced to gate-check. The main compartment opens like a suitcase for easy packing and unpacking, and a quick-access laptop sleeve makes it easy to grab your laptop at airport security or once you reach your seat.</p><ul><li>Made of durable 450-denier recycled polyester to withstand the demands of travel</li><li>Foam AirScape\u00ae backpanel with LightWire frame transfers the load evenly while maintaining airflow to your back</li><li>Women's-specific fit uses angled shoulder straps and hip belt</li><li>Adjustable torso length and sternum strap accommodates a wide range of users</li><li>Stowaway harness and hipbelt zip behind a panel for protection when you check your bag</li><li>Large U-shaped zippered opening provides easy access to the main compartment</li><li>Lockable zippers on the main compartment for worry free transport</li><li>Padded top and side handles provide comfortable carry options in suitcase mode</li><li>Interior mesh pockets and compression straps keep your stuff organized</li><li>Quick access padded sleeve holds a 16in. laptop</li><li>Large front shove it pocket and external zippered toiletry pocket</li><li>Stretch mesh hip belt pocket</li><li>External straps let you compress the load</li><li>Compatible with the Farpoint/Fairview\u00ae Daypack or Daylite\u00ae packs</li></ul>",
