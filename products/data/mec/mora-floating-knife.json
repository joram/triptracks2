  "description": "<p>A good knife is as useful at sea as it is on land. But most knives have one significant flaw: they sink. Maintaining the classic styling and ergonomic design that Mora is known for, the Mora Floating Knife solves the buoyancy issue with a natural cork handle that not only floats, but provides a sure, comfortable grip in wet or dry conditions.</p><ul><li>Natural cork handle is soft, grippy and floats</li><li>Scandi ground blade is great for a variety of outdoor tasks</li><li>Rigid high-visibility sheath is easy to find in low light</li><li>Sheath has an easy-to-use clip system that allows you to mount your knife almost anywhere</li></ul>",
