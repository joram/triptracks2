  "description": "<p>The legendary Kingpin Bindings use a conventional tech toe piece with an alpine-style heel that has no tech pins. The result is a lightweight frameless tech binding for resort skiing, touring or skiing lift-accessed sidecountry runs. A very stiff, carbon-reinforced front with wide footprint and ISI toe piece makes the binding easier to step into. The wide hole pattern and XXL power transmitters delivers direct power transmission for the utmost control and fun on the descent.</p><ul><li>Carbon reinforced toe is stiff and light</li><li>ISI Toe Piece intuitive step-in uses a wide platform and integrated stop to automatically position and align your boot</li><li>Pivot point is pushed toward the toe to let the foot roll naturally</li><li>Pins click directly into the boot to reduce lifting force required to walk</li><li>Toe springs offer great energy absorption, contact pressure and have high compression value</li><li>XXL Power Transmitter heel has contact points that are wide and far apart, so it holds the boot heel along a broad surface of the outer edge for direct power transmission to your ski</li><li>Anti Ice Pads in the base of the toe and heel prevent icing in critical areas</li><li>Brakes are self-locking in walk mode and activate when you switch to ski mode.
