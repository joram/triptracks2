  "description": "<p>Push off in these skate skis. For fitness skate skiers and amateur racers, these blades strike a nice balance of performance and ease of use. In slightly shorter lengths, these blades are easier to control. They're inspired by Rossignol's race-caliber skis, so they still offer sharp edges and a low resistance base for exceptional glide. From double poling practice to testing yourself in competition, these skis are happy to do it all.</p><ul><li>Active cap construction flexes from tip to tail and offers good torsional rigidity</li><li>Extended edge offers good control and glide</li><li>Low Density Core for lightweight performance</li><li>Double guide groove for good control in different positions</li><li>K7000 graphite base glides on variable snow conditions</li><li>Compatible with NNN bindings and includes pre-mounted IFP plates</li></ul>",
