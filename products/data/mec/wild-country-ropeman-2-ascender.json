  "description": "<p>The Ropeman 2 makes a great alternative to prusiks or heavier ascenders. It is essentially an incomplete ascender until you add a locking carabiner to it. The carabiner acts as the spine against which the cam presses the rope. The version has a steel cam and forged side plates. It's a touch lighter than earlier versions, and the internal radii gives it smoother function with different types of carabiners and skinny cords.</p><ul><li>Stainless steel cam, aluminum side plates</li><li>Forged side plates work with a range of carabiner types and shapes</li><li>Works with ropes from 8 to 13mm</li><li>4kN strength</li><li>CE certified</li></ul>",
