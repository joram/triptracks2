  "description": "<p>Geared towards indoor climbing, the vegan friendly Veloce is ready to handle big holds, volumes, and steep angles of modern gyms. The roomier toebox and moderate downturn keeps precision in the toes without the compression and pressure of an ultra-high-end shoe. Incredibly soft and sticky S-72 rubber grips even the smeariest of footholds, and the small Flexan midsole provides enough support for edgy problems on more vertical walls. This shoe is great for beginner to advanced climbers looking for a comfortable shoe for long gym sessions or training days.</p><ul><li>Vegan friendly so you can wear these shoes with peace of mind</li><li>Microfibre upper ensures a consistent fit over time</li><li>Relaxed Performance Fit is slightly asymmetric and downturned for precise foot placements without too much pressure</li><li>Lacing system gives you precise control of the fit, letting you focus on the puzzle at hand</li><li>1.0mm Flexan midsole under toes provides some support without losing sensitivity</li><li>DTS\u2122 randing system balances edging power and smearing ability</li><li>PAF heel system distributes the pressure on the heel for a comfortable fit</li><li>Super sticky S-72 rubber provides exceptional friction.
