  "description": "<p>The second generation Apex offers an improved GPS, free downloadable worldwide maps, a more precise heart rate monitor, music, and more. Thanks to a new GPS chipset and updated antenna design, you now get a single frequency connection to up to 5 satellite constellations. More connections, means better reception and more accurate tracks of your runs, rides, and swims. Outfitted with the next evolution in Coros\u2019 optical heart rate monitor technology, the Apex 2 provides the most precise pulse metrics ever seen on a Coros device. Preloaded with dozens of sport profiles, for both indoor and outdoor activities, there\u2019s a mode for everyone. While you use the Apex 2, it learns how you train, letting you know how to adjust your workout schedule and intensity, it will even let you know when you should take a rest day. No matter how hard you crush in in the gym or on the trails, there are factors we just can\u2019t control, like the weather. The onboard barometer tracks environmental pressure changes, alerting you when a storm is on its way. And daily sun tracking lets you know how much daylight you have left, as well as sunrise and sunset times. Robust smartwatch functionality will keep the Apex 2 on your wrist outside of training hours. When synced with a phone running the free COROS app, you can receive texts, social media alerts and email, share and download workouts, review activities, and more.</p><ul><li>Sport profiles include: running (indoor, outdoor and trail), cycling (indoor and outdoor), swimming (pool and open water), triathlon, gym cardio, strength training, hiking, snowsports and more</li><li>Multisport mode lets you transition between different activities within a single workout</li><li>Strength training program has more than 200 exercises, selectable muscle groups, auto-detects reps, counts sets and provides a comprehensive breakdown in the app with body-mapped exercise tracking, including how many reps you did for each muscle group</li><li>Integrated running power meter</li><li>Updated optical heart rate monitor uses an array of LEDs and sensors to provide more precise heart rate data than previous generations and can even provide blood oxygenation levels (SpO2)</li><li>Recovery advisor prevents over-training and helps maximize training intervals</li><li>Advanced training metrics: training status, 7-day load, race predictor (5k, 10k, half and full marathon), training focus, effort pace, and more</li><li>Free maps are available to download via the Coros web app via your computer</li><li>Music playback: load your favourite MP3s directly to your watch via USB connection to your computer.
