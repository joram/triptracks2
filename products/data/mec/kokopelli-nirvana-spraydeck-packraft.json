  "description": "<p>Hike into untapped rivers and go for a paddle. Packing down to the size of a small sleeping bag and rated for class III rapids, the Nirvana makes it easy to get on the water. The combing and spraydeck have undergone a complete evolution, so you can surf bigger swells and hit faster features with less risk of swamping. Ruggedly constructed with the pontoons and spraydeck using the same burly material found on full-sized commercial rafts, while the floor system gets a serious upgrade of a Kevlar\u00ae Aramid blend. No need for a roof rack, just pop your packraft in your pack, pannier or trunk and you\u2019re good to go.</p><ul><li>Tough TPU-coated 210D nylon sidewalls, 840D Kevlar Aramid-Nylon blend reinforced floor system</li><li>Spraydeck design offers protection and is reinforced in key wear areas</li><li>8-stainless steel lash points (4 bow, 2 stern,  2 internal) for securing gear or mounting a back-band</li><li>Leafield D7 valve for quick inflation and deflation</li><li>Water rating: class I \u2013 III</li><li>Weight capacity: up to 136kg (300lbs)</li><li>Inner dimensions: 145 x 41cm (57 x 16cm)</li><li>Included: 1x Nirvana, 1x inflation bag, 1x inflation tube, 1x compression strap set, 1x EVA backband, 1x inflatable seat, 1x combing ring tube and 1x repair kit with glue and zipper lubricant.
