  "description": "<p>Get all the great features of the legendary Meridian drysuit in a less expensive fabric. Hydrus 3L is a new waterproof-breathable fabric from Kokatat with similar performance, but less breathability than GORE-TEX\u00ae. It allows you to opt-in to the drysuit experience to enjoy comfort and protection that's far greater than a wetsuit. Integrated socks keep your feet dry and warm, while the relief zipper is a great convenience afloat and ashore.</p><ul><li>Made with Kokatat Hydrus 3L waterproof-breathable fabric</li><li>Self-draining punch-through neck and wrist neoprene over-cuffs</li><li>Latex neck and wrist gaskets</li><li>Self-draining zippered chest pocket with key lanyard</li><li>Competition-cut underarm for full paddling range of motion</li><li>Covered watersports entry zipper</li><li>Dual-adjustable overskirt with hook-and-loop compatible neoprene</li><li>Adjustable bungee drawcord at waist</li><li>Self-draining seat and knee patches</li><li>Hook-and-loop adjustable neoprene over-cuffs at ankles</li><li>Factory sealed seams</li><li>Relief zipper</li><li>Integrated Hydrus 3L socks</li></ul>",
