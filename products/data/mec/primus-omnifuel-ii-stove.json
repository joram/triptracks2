  "description": "<p>Find fuel for this stove almost anywhere on the globe. The OmniFuel burns white gas, kerosene, diesel, or aviation fuel \u2013 and you can attach butane or propane canisters. Its willingness to burn whatever you can locate makes it great for expeditions, mountain trips and frequent users. To keep it clean and reduce carbon build up when burning unrefined fuel, the Ergo pump has the flip-over feature that runs air through the fuel line when shutting it off. A secondary needle valve provides excellent simmering and heat control, and it's accessible for cleaning.</p><ul><li>Made of brass, stainless steel, and aluminum</li><li>Serrated pot supports provide slip-free operation even on tilted surfaces,lock in place when assembled and fold up into a compact package for travel</li><li>Boil time may vary depending on fuel used, altitude and climate</li><li>Built-in pre-heater improves performance at altitude, and in cold temperatures</li><li>Comes with pump and threaded valve head for use with the either the pump and bottle combination or Primus canisters</li><li>Deluxe carrying bag and maintenance multi-tool included</li><li>Fuel bottle with child-proof cap included</li></ul>",
