  "description": "<p>This performance half-rope is also fully certified for use as a twin. While it might be skinny, the Dyad is designed to offer the right balance between diameter and weight.  Its sleekness and ability to be clipped as a half or twin, reduces rope drag on long pitches, making it an excellent choice for ice, wandering rock routes, and alpine adventures.</p><ul><li>XEROS permanent dry treatment is applied to nylon filaments before they're twisted into yarns. This results in less water absorption through the entire rope and prevents freezing in cold environments</li><li>Made with PFOA-free, PFAS-free, and bluesign\u00ae certified raw materials</li><li>Designed as a half or twin rope so must be used in pairs</li><li>Meets testing standards for half, and twin ropes</li><li>Specs shown are for use as a half rope</li><li>When used as a twin rope, the specs are as follows (based on tests with 2 strands): Dynamic elongation: 25% Static elongation: 3.3% Impact force: 9.7kN UIAA fall rating: 17</li></ul>",
