  "description": "<p>Lightweight bars that help smooth out the trail, and even take the bite out of braking bumps. OneUp wanted to make carbon bars that were more than just light, and the results are incredibly responsive and incredibly comfortable. The magic of the OneUp bar comes from making the stiffest part of the bar, the center, as small as possible and by rethinking the classic profile. By making the transition in the rise an oval, instead of circle, these bars flex in a way that you don\u2019t notice when riding but you will notice in comfort, it is almost like suspension for your hands.</p><ul><li>Oval transition absorbs vibrations, keeping your hands and wrists happy</li><li>Stiff in where it counts, providing optimized steering response and control</li><li>Tested against leading carbon bars and foam filled aluminum bars. The results were, on average, a 21% increase in vertical compliance (comfort) coupled with a 28% increase in steering stiffness (responsiveness)</li><li>Carbon fibre is light and strong</li><li>800mm wide with marking for cutting to your perfect size. Minimum trim width: 740mm</li><li>Marked centerline and degrees of tilt make it easy to dial in your cockpit</li><li>Works with grips with dual clamps or only inboard clamps, will not work with grips that only have an outboard clamp</li></ul>",
