  "description": "<p>Use a chest harness on kids, or if you\u2019re particularly concerned about staying upright while climbing. Mountaineers may wish to incorporate one for potential crevasse falls, although many will simply clip the rope into their pack shoulder straps. Chest harnesses are also very useful for long fixed line ascents when using chest-mounted ascenders.</p><ul><li>Never use without a sit harness</li><li>Added safety bonus - adjustable via 2 double-back Petzl safety buckles</li><li>1 size fits all</li></ul>",
