  "description": "<p>Now Garmin not only watches for oncoming vehicles, it records them. The latest addition to the Varia line gets the addition of a camera. By pairing a video footage with the same rear facing radar that has been keeping riders safe for years, the RCT715 is like eyes in the back of your helmet. Much like a dashcam, the RCT715 can detect if an incident has occurred. Video is saved before, during and after the incident, even if you have the camera recording turned off. Each video is stamped with the date, time, location, and speed of the incident, giving you a little video evidence, just in case. Through the connection to your Edge or phone, the Varia radar adds an approaching car display on the screen. Great for long rides on quiet roads where you might need the RCT715 to snap you back to the reality of an approaching vehicle. The powerful LED makes sure that drivers are aware of you. When riding busy streets, the radar will tell you what you already know \u2013 you\u2019re surrounded by cars, but you can still use it as a standalone bike light. Complete control is at your fingertips with the free phone app, or you compatible bike computer.</p><ul><li>1080p or 720p video at 30 frames per second with a 140\u00b0 viewing angle</li><li>Free Varia app lets you choose recoding length, recording mode, overlays, audio, and more</li><li>Colour coded approaching vehicle display, green shows you're in the clear, yellow indicates a car at a normal speed, red when a car is approaching quickly</li><li>Display minimizes when no cars are around, for a full screen view of your Edge unit.
