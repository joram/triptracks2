  "description": "<p>Use shortwave ultraviolet light to disinfect your water. When you immerse the lamp in the water it disrupts the DNA of bacteria, viruses and protozoa, rendering them harmless. SteriPen is most effective with clear water. It does reduce microbial contamination in mildly turbid water, but you should consider pre-filtering any time you expect to encounter muddy or silty water sources.</p><ul><li>Treatment of .5L takes approximately 45 seconds and 1.0L takes approximately 90 seconds</li><li>Lamp life is approximately 8,000 treatments</li><li>Requires 4 AA batteries (not included)</li><li>Manufacturer\u2019s tests with lithium batteries treated approximately 150L. Colder temperatures will reduce the number of doses per battery charge</li></ul>",
