  "description": "<p>This 12.7-millimetre (half-inch) webbing is very malleable and has a small diameter -- so it\u2019s perfect for a tie-off on aid pieces and pins. It is not as strong as runner strength webbing and is intended only for holding progression, not falls.</p><ul><li>This product is sold by the metre</li><li>Tensile strength is 450kg</li></ul>",
