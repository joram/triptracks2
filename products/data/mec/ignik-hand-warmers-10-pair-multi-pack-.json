With a little shake, these handwarmers do their thing and give you some heat when you need it. They slip easily into gloves, pockets, and anywhere else you need a little toastiness.</p><ul><li>Contains 10 pairs (20 warmers in total), with each pair in its own re-usable and 100% recyclable outer pouch</li><li>The AirBarrier\u2122 pouch keeps more air out optimizing the efficiency, so the cozy lasts longer, up to 10 hours</li><li>Activated by contact with the air (oxidization). Activated warmer can be paused for up to 3 days, by putting them in the resealable outer pouch</li><li>Made from natural and biodegradable ingredients, meaning you can easily dispose of the pouch\u2019s contents in any compost bin or use them as fertilizer</li></ul>",
