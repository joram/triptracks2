  "description": "<p>Rethink how you plug tubeless tires, no more bacon strips. Stan\u2019s Dual Action Repair for Tubeless or DART is a new way to patch tubeless tires. Instead of working a strip of rubber into the puncture, the DART hooks a little bundle of material over the puncture and fuses with your tire\u2019s sealant, essentially becoming part of your tire. There is no excess to trim and process is quick and easy, just slip the DART in, top up your air (if needed) and ride on.</p><ul><li>Patches are treated with an adhesive that reacts to latex sealant, creating a bond over the slice or puncture</li><li>Barbed tips of the DART are easy to insert and pose less risk to rim tape than longer tools</li><li>Holds 2 DART patches</li><li>Integrated valve core tool for easy sealant top ups</li><li>Threaded cap keeps the DART safe and you safe</li></ul>",
