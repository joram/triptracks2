A narrow profile lets this flattop chain glide easily up and down 12-speed cassettes and provides much quieter operation.</p><ul><li>Flattop design allows the chain to be narrower, making wider gear ranges possible</li><li>Quieter than standard chains</li><li>Compatible with SRAM 12-speed 1x and 2x eTap AXS road groupsets</li><li>Solid pin construction is strong and durable</li><li>Flattop Powerlock chain connector for better chain guiding and longevity</li><li>Nickel silver and inner outer plates</li></ul>",
