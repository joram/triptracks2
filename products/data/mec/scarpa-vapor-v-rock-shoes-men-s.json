  "description": "<p>Small edges and nasty smears are nothing these shoes can't handle. The updated Vapor V has a slightly stiffer midsole than the previous, providing a supportive platform for hard face and crack climbs. Scarpa's Bi-Tension system pulls power back from your toes rather than cramming your foot painfully forward, so you get more power with less tension on your foot.</p><ul><li>Uppers are made of microsuede for comfort and long-lasting fit</li><li>Padded mesh tongue cushions feet on long multi-pitches and in cracks</li><li>Slightly asymmetric, curved shape for precise foot placement</li><li>1.5mm Talyn midsole provides a supportive platform for edging and jamming</li><li>Sole is 3.5mm Vibram\u00ae XS Edge rubber grips small edges</li><li>Members typically downsize 1-1.5 sizes (performance fit) or 0.5-1 sizes (comfort fit) from their street shoe size</li></ul>",
