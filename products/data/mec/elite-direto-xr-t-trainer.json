  "description": "<p>The Direto XR-T merges Elite\u2019s Direto line with their Drivo line, making more power and more climbing, more affordable. When it's time to take your winter training to the next level (and cut down on worn trainer tires), direct drive trainers are the way to go. Control it with apps and software via ANT+ FE-C and Bluetooth smart to reproduce the steepness of the course you're riding. With a maximum incline of 24%, you'll be able to ride the equivalent of Scanuppia (if your legs allow it). If you're a green jersey type, the Direto XR provides up to 2300W of resistance at 40km/h for tough, out of the saddle sprints. If you're going to put the effort in to follow a power-based training program, this one has a power accuracy of 1.5%, comparable to most stand-alone power meters.</p><ul><li>Direct drive trainer ensures that every watt you generate is accounted for</li><li>Very quiet, the only noises you hear will be the chain and shifting gears</li><li>Optical Torque Sensor (OTS) provides precise power measurement within +/- 1.5%.
