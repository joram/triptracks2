  "description": "<p>Tough enough to work the moves, light enough to redpoint. The IonR 9.4mm is a high-performance rope that's substantial enough for cragging, without weighing down your pack on long approaches. The new XEROS dry technology is applied when the nylon is still a filament, treating the entire rope from core to sheath, and resulting in less waste and energy use than traditional treatments. The good balance of strength, versatility, and dry technology make it a great option for projecting to desert tower adventures to waterfall ice.</p><ul><li>XEROS permanent dry treatment is applied to nylon filaments before they're twisted into yarns. This results in less water absorption through the entire rope and prevents freezing in cold environments</li><li>Made with PFOA-free, PFAS-free, and bluesign\u00ae certified raw materials</li><li>Middle mark increases safety and speed on rappels</li></ul>",
