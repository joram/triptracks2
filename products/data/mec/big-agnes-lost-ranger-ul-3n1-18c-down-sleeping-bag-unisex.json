  "description": "<p>Dial in the perfect setup for the weather with the Lost Ranger 3N1, part of the Big Agnes sleep system lineup. The ultralight multilayer zippered system lets you adjust insulation to match the conditions. To save weight, there is less insulation on the bottom, where the down would be crushed beneath your body and provide little warmth. Instead, an integrated sleeve holds your sleeping pad securely under you. The cut is roomier than a traditional mummy bag, but the overall weight is comparable to a narrower cut bag.</p><ul><li>Shell is ultralight ripstop polyester with a water repellent finish. Lining is soft polyester microfiber</li><li>DownTek fill is treated for water-repellency and has antimicrobial and antibacterial protection</li><li>3N1 system has an inner and outer bag for multiple sleeping options</li><li>Temperature ratings: Complete system -18 \u00baC, Inner bag -7 \u00baC, Outer bag 7 \u00baC</li><li>Create a doublewide sleeping bag by connecting two 3N1 bags</li><li>Integrated sleeping pad sleeve has side stretch panels to accommodate different pad thicknesses. Regular size fits a pad up to 51 x 183cm. Long fits a pad up to 51 x 198 cm</li><li>Since there's less insulation on the bottom, for best results, use with pads that have an R-value of 4 or more</li><li>Free Range Hood lets you lift and move your head, even when fully zipped up and has a one-handed cinch adjustment</li><li>Built-in pocket keeps a pillow in place through the night</li><li>Interior loops for attaching a bag liner</li><li>Includes a storage bag and a nylon stuff sack</li></ul>",
