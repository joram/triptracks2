  "description": "<p>This set of super-bright lights lets you add a lot of visibility without adding a lot of weight. With USB charging and 5 different modes, it's a worthwhile addition to your kit. Knog developed a clever magnetic mount that lets you swap your Plus light from your bike to you, or just off your bike with a click. An integrated clip lets you attach the lights to you clothing or your 4-legged friend on low-light outings.  Weighing in at a paltry 12 grams a piece these little lights won\u2019t slow you down or tug at your kit.</p><ul><li>Magnetic mount lets you attach your light to the bike mount base with little more than a magnetic click.
