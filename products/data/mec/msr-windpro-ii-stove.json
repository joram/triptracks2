  "description": "<p>The efficient and versatile Windpro has been adapted to burn inverted canisters. This adapted setup improves performance in cold weather and a provides a more fluid and consistent output throughout the life of the canister.</p><p>Like the original design, the Windpro II has a remote burner: the canister and stove are connected through a fuel line. Because the stove is not set directly above the canister, you can safely use a windscreen to protect the flame. This dramatically improve the stove's performance and efficiency, particularly in stormy, gusty places.</p><ul><li>Excellent stability for large (up to 25cm) pots and can be used with bake ovens</li><li>Includes a windscreen, heat reflector, and inverted canister stand</li><li>Precision flame control, from torch to simmer</li><li>Fuel canister available separately</li></ul>",
