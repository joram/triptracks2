  "description": "<p>Super light and skinny, this rope is well suited to hard redpoints or fast ascents in the alpine. Individual Teflon-coated yarns reduce friction by sliding past each other when the rope is loaded. The UIAA certified dry treatment absorbs less than 2% of its weight in water, so it stays light and is less susceptible to freezing in wet and cold conditions.</p><ul><li>Thermo Shield treatment gives it excellent handling properties, a supple feel and an impressive strength rating</li><li>PCF-free Eco Dry finish makes this rope durably water repellent and dirt resistant</li><li>3D lap coiled so you can use the rope right out of the package</li><li>Meets UIAA standard water-repellent test, meaning this rope is fast-drying, absorbs virtually no water and resists freezing</li></ul>",
