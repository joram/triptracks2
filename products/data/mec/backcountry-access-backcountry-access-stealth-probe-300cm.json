  "description": "<p>Burly enough to stand up to the demands of professional use and deep snowpacks, the Stealth 300 is free of the dangling pull-cable found on other probes. In its place, there\u2019s a tube nested into the first probe section. It makes it smaller in your pack, and quick to deploy: just pull the trigger and the probe extends to its full 300cm.</p><ul><li>Laser-etched depth markings are easy to read and highly resistant to wear</li><li>Tip penetrates debris easily</li></ul>",
