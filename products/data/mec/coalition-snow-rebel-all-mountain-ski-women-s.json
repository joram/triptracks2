  "description": "<p>With a rebellious spirit and an easy carve, the Rebel Ski is perfect for anyone who wants to ski fast and have fun doing it. 30cm of tip rocker gives you that sweet snappy feeling you want for glossy groomer turns and a touch of side-piste action. The full birch wood core adds dampness, provides a solid flex and holds up well at high speed and in a variety of conditions. With a more pronounced sidecut and camber underfoot, this ski rips corduroy, trees, and crud with ease.</p><ul><li>Slanted ABS sidewalls reduce the swing weight for manoevrability</li><li>Triaxial fibreglass offers a good balance of flex and torsional control</li><li>Full birch wood core absorbs vibration and provides solid flex at high speed</li><li>Sandwich construction brings playful energy and rebound</li><li>17mm Single Radius Sidecut excels when charging on firm snow</li><li>Early rise tip improves floatation and offers easy turn initiation</li><li>Traditional camber underfoot for powerful, confidence inspiring turns on boilerplate</li><li>Sintered 7500 base has great wax retention for a fast ride</li></ul>",
