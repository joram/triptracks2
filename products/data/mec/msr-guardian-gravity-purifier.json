  "description": "<p>A true game changer that makes almost any questionable water source safe to drink. The Guardian purifies and filters water, so you don't need to carry chemical water treatment or a UV purifier when you're in virus territory. The gravity system is a low-effort option that needs no pumping - simply fill and raise the reservoir and let gravity filter and purify your water while you set up camp, prep dinner, or just relax.</p><ul><li>Durable film reservoir with 1000-denier fabric bottom for increased abrasion resistance</li><li>Hollow fibre technology uses polymer fibres to create a high-surface-area filter that allows water to flow quickly through a 0.02 micron effective pore size</li><li>Activated carbon reduces concentrations of some chemicals (including iodine and chlorine), odours and tastes</li><li>Purge valve flushes system without the need to backflush</li><li>Universal bottle attapter attaches to most water bottles</li><li>Meets NSF protocol P248 military standards</li></ul>",
