  "description": "<p>The ultimate alpine setup, this pair of half ropes are light, as impermeable as ropes can be, and have smooth handling characteristics. The Golden Dry aspect (sheath and core are both treated) makes them fluid when running over rock and through your device. Unicore technology bond the sheath and core, so if the sheath is nicked or cut, the rope won't bunch, so it stays flexible and passable through your device. It adds a measure of security that's indispensable for ultra-thin ropes.</p><ul><li>Dry Cover treatment on the sheath resists dust, humidity and abrasion and improves handling</li><li>Golden Dry core treatment resists water-absorption and reduces water weight gain</li><li>Unicore technology adds security by bonding the sheath and core</li><li>Low impact force</li><li>Sold as a pair</li><li>Beal plants a tree for every rope sold</li></ul>",
