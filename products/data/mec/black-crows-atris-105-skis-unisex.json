  "description": "<p>Black Crows created these skis for the daredevil in each of us and perfected them to handle all snow types. The step-down sidewall with semi cap construction provides dampening on hardpack conditions. Double rocker floats through pow, but with enough stiffness and sidecut to keep things fun on firm snow. Capable in tight spots and powerful in open bowls, these versatile skis are ready to take you anywhere.</p><ul><li>Lightweight Poplar wood and fibreglass core feels light underfoot but still has good shock absorption and stability</li><li>Stiff flex for performance and stability on any snow type</li><li>Double rocker tip and tail with medium classic camber underfoot</li><li>Semi cap sidewall construction for torsion and flex control</li><li>108mm waist offers good float while maintaining maneuverability in firm conditions</li><li>Slightly straight side cut for maneuverability and stability at high speeds</li><li>Sintered graphite base is fast and very durable</li></ul>",
