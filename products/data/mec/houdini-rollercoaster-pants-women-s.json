These bibs use an incredibly durable shell fabric with mechanical 2-way stretch, so you are free to carve, kick turn or high step without restrictions. The Atmos\u2122 membrane is hydrophilic, not micro-porous, meaning breathability won't be compromised when the jacket gets dirty. Harness-compatible pockets, 3/4-length vents and reinforced kick patches round out this backcountry staple.</p><ul><li>Durable Loop Hardshell\u2122 ripstop polyester has 70% recycled content</li><li>Atmos\u2122 waterproof-breathable membrane repels moisture</li><li>Fully taped seams and fluorocarbon-free DWR finish keep wetness from seeping in</li><li>3/4-length zippered vents let you release heat when you're working hard</li><li>Waterproof zippers</li><li>Thigh pockets positioned to allow access when wearing a harness</li><li>Integrated gaiters layer securely over boots</li><li>Schoeller reinforced kickpatches protect against sharp edges</li><li>Should this garment wear out after years of use, it can be returned to Houdini for recycling</li></ul>",
