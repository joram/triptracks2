  "description": "<p>An optimistic outlook will serve in many situations, but the Houdini is insurance that your day won't get \"real\" when the weather shifts on your run or multipitch route.  The featherlight fabric is treated with DWR to shed light rain, and the tight weave blocks wind and withstands abrasion. Half-elastic cuffs, cords and toggles are designed to be trim and lightweight. In addition, the chest pocket doubles as a stuff sack and has a reinforced carabiner loop so it can be clipped to your harness or pack in readiness for the clouds rolling in.</p><ul><li>Featherweight nylon recycled ripstop fabric with DWR treatment is weather-resistant</li><li>Low profile hood with drawcord to fine tune fit while maintaining peripheral vision</li><li>Front zipper is treated with DWR to resist moisture</li><li>Zippered chest pocket converts to a stuff sack for easy storage.
