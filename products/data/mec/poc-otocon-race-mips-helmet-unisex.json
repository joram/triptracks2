  "description": "<p>Maximize your protection and comfort without overheating. This lightweight full-face helmet is loaded with technical details to keep you safe when dropping in. The combination of EPP and EPS foam, paired with MIPS, dispurse impacts effectively in case of a crash. Plenty of air channels keep you ventilated and the removable internal cheek pads let you have greater airflow when grinding uphill with the security when it's time for the descent.</p><ul><li>MIPS Integra (Multi-directional Impact Protection System) reduces rotational forces in an oblique impact. Integra uses moving pads instead of a moving inner liner to provide the protection of standard MIPS, but using less space and allowing more ventilation</li><li>twICEme\u00ae NFC medical ID system allows you to register your helmet with the free app. Through the app you can load emergency contacts and important medical information. With the twICEme system, a first responder can scan your helmet for instant access to time sensitive medical information</li><li>RECCO\u00ae reflector allow search and rescue teams to find you faster should things take a turn for the worse</li><li>Break-away brim helps absorb impact, decreasing the force that makes it to you, like a crumple zone in a car</li><li>Internal aramid bridge adds strength and reduces the chance of puncture without adding extra weight</li><li>Race Lock internal harness can be adjusted from external dial</li><li>Cheek pads can be removed for increased ventilation</li><li>Removable grill provides additional airflow on warmer, dry days</li><li>Lots of vents help you keep a cool head, pulling air in the front and letting it exhaust out the back</li></ul>",
