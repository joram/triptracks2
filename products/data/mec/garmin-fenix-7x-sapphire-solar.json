  "description": "<p>The latest Garmin f\u0113nix makes it easier to stay in touch with how you train. The touchscreen on the f\u0113nix 7 lets you choose between tapping, swiping or tried-and-true buttons. An efficient solar panel could make charging a thing of the past. Regional TopoActive maps help you find your way or plan your route home or abroad. These watches blend smartwatch functionality with advanced heart rate-based training tools and a backcountry GPS. Onboard sensors breakdown every movement, comparing how often and how hard you train, how you rest, and even where you train \u2013 factoring in altitude and temperature. The data lets you map the evolution of your fitness, from stamina to improved recovery times.
