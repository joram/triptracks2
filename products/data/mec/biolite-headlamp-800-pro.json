  "description": "<p>When you find yourself surrounded by darkness and you\u2019re far from home (or camp, or the finish line), this powerful headlamp will light your way, it even gives you options. The low-profile light head has 3 LEDs to choose from, white spotlight, white floodlight, and red floodlight. Outfitted with constant lighting mode, you get a regulated output that won\u2019t dim for a set amount of time. Intuitive 2-button controls take you through the modes and lets you toggle constant lighting mode on or off. Burst mode gives you direct access to 800 darkness melting lumens in 30 second increments, great for seeing a little further down the trail or illuminating things that go bump in the night. USB-C charging does away with annoying \u201cstill good\u201d batteries, making it easy to keep your headlamp topped-up and ready to go. And, if you have an all night epic, use the included run forever cable to connect the 800 Pro to a powerbank and get longer runtimes. When using this cable, you get a pass-through charge, meaning your powerbank charges and powers your light.</p><ul><li>Constant lighting mode provides regulated brightness for a set amount of time, 2 hours in high (500 lumens), 4 hours in medium (250 lumens) and 150 hours in low (5 lumens).
