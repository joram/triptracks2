  "description": "<p>Balancing durability, weight and dry treatment, the Velocity is an all-arounder for almost any situation. It has a solid hand for easy clipping and a smooth, tight sheath for low drag through gear and over rock, with a low weight and impact force to take on any rock or ice project. The new XEROS dry technology is applied when the nylon is still a filament, treating the entire rope from core to sheath, and resulting in less waste and energy use than traditional treatments.</p><ul><li>XEROS permanent dry treatment is applied to nylon filaments before they're twisted into yarns. This results in less water absorption through the entire rope and prevents freezing in cold environments</li><li>Made with PFOA-free, PFAS-free, and bluesign\u00ae certified raw materials</li><li>Middle mark increases safety and speed on rappels</li></ul>",
