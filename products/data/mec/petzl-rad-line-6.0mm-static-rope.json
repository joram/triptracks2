  "description": "<p>An ultralight static rope that works for short raps or for extracting someone who went for a ride down a crevasse. Because it has limited stretch, it's an efficient tool in a haul system or to use as an ascent line, but it's not the one to use to arrest a fall or to provide a dynamic belay.</p><ul><li>Ultralight and compact 6mm cord</li><li>Dyneema\u00ae and aramid-reinforced sheath offers great strength-to-weight ratio</li><li>Compatible with Petzl Tibloc and Micro Traxion ascenders</li><li>Rough-textured sheath improves friction when rappelling or arresting a crevasse fall</li><li>Cord elongation of less than 2% ensures efficiency during rescue</li></ul>",
