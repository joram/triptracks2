The Swiss-made diamond sheets are mounted on highly precise injection-moulded polycarbonate backers. The colour-coded backers help you select the right grit for the job at hand. The diamond cluster pattern lasts longer than conventional diamond sheets and makes for an easier cleaning job.</p><ul><li>Polycarbonate backing plates are flat and very precise</li><li>Available in extra-coarse (100-grit), coarse (200-grit), medium (400-grit), fine (800-grit) and extra-fine (1500-grit)</li></ul>",
