  "description": "<p>Feel the movement of your sprints, from the comfort of your living room. Wahoo has taken their latest generation KICKR smart trainer and mounted it atop a dynamic platform to create the KICKR MOVE. With 10cm of forward and rearward movement, the MOVE lets you feel when you drop the hammer. The MOVE also features Wahoo\u2019s Axis feet which help mimic your natural riding movement when riding at a steady pace. The KICKR is trusted by pro teams all over the world, and now with the MOVE platform Wahoo\u2019s top-tier trainer is more immersive than ever. Like the KICKR v.6, the MOVE has WiFi. WiFi allows your favourite training apps to send course data to your trainer, giving you the option of saving your Bluetooth and ANT+ signals for sensors. Works with a wide range of training apps to battle with friends while it storms outside. Power accuracy stays constant at an impressive +/- 1%, keeping your legs challenged, and with 2200W, you\u2019ll tap out long before the Kickr does. Don't expect the noise of this trainer to drown out your heavy breathing, either \u2013 it's a virtually silent ride.</p><ul><li>Move platform provides up to 10cm of forward and 10cm of rearward movement</li><li>Lock-out functionality lets you turn your MOVE into a static trainer</li><li>WiFi integration makes set up easier than ever and allows automatic firmware updates</li><li>Direct-drive trainer accounts for every Watt you generate</li><li>Power reading accuracy of +/- 1% for precise training</li><li>Maximum brake power of 2200W</li><li>Heavy 7.25kg (16lbs.) flywheel ensures a smooth, authentic ride</li><li>Heavy-duty frame built for years of use</li><li>Compatible with 12x142mm and 12x148mm thru axles, as well as 130mm and 135mm quick-release axles</li><li>Realistic slope simulation of up to 20% and down to -10%</li><li>ERG mode maintains a certain effort level regardless of your cadence</li><li>ERG Easy Ramp mode gradually transitions back into ERG mode over 10 seconds, so if you have to stop for some reason starting again feels natural</li><li>Compatible with road and mountain bike wheel sizes of 24in, 650c, 700c, 26in, 27.5in, 29in</li><li>Front wheel support sold separately</li><li>Includes an 11-speed 11-28T ratio cassette.
