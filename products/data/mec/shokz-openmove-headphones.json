  "description": "<p>Give your world a soundtrack without blocking it out. A solid playlist provides that extra bit of energy you need to train at your best, but it's not always safe to focus entirely on your music. Bone conduction technology sends sound vibrations directly to your inner ear, leaving your ear canal free to take in the world around you. OpenMove headphones let you listen to music and make and answer phone calls without interrupting your workout, and their dual inline microphones filter out noise pollution to deliver clear calls in nearly any environment.</p><ul><li>Bone conduction sends sound vibrations directly to your inner ear.
