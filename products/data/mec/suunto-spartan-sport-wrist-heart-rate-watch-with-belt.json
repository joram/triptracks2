  "description": "<p>Loaded with more than 80 activity profiles, the Spartan is ready to push limits. With an optical heartrate monitor, information comes straight off your wrist, and the included Smart Sensor monitor adds a new level of precision to your training data.  Internal GPS provides speed and distance information, while an accelerometer translates your movement into performance enhancing data. Connecting to both standard GPS and GLONASS satellites, you get a fast and accurate signal. When paired with a compatible smartphone running the Movescount app, the Spartan\u2019s capabilities are greatly increased.  Through Movescount you can transfer completed activities, receive smart notifications, plan routes using heatmap information, and more. Heatmaps are one of the coolest features of the Spartan line.  They display other Movescount user\u2019s activities over local maps, making it easier to find the best runs, rides, trails, or swims, wherever you are.  Activity tracker functionality keeps track of your steps and gives you an estimate of calories burnt throughout the day.
