  "description": "<p>Shredding a trail in your own little tunnel of light is a special kind of 2-wheeled magic. Brighter than most motorcycle headlamps, the Duo 2200 is ready to melt any darkness that dares get in your way. Side-by-side LEDs and custom reflectors balance flood and spot lighting, letting you see near and far. And, the wireless bar-mounted switch lets you adjust your light\u2019s mode, without taking your hands off the bars. Powered by an efficient battery pack that doubles as a powerbank, just in case you need to top up your phone or Edge on the way to the trailhead. When the trails are covered in snow, the included helmet mount and head strap make this light a great option for low-light ski and snowshoes sessions.</p><ul><li>4 modes: high \u2013 2200 lumens, medium \u2013 1100 lumens, low \u2013 220 lumens and flashing</li><li>Up to 2200 lumens of light</li><li>Machined aluminum housing with integrated heat sink reduces heat build-up</li><li>IP65 weatherproofing keeps the light shining in even the heaviest downpours</li><li>Battery uses 2 21700 cells, 30Wh 7.4V 4000mAh capacity</li><li>Ports \u2013 input: DC 8.4V, USB-C 5V, output \u2013 DC 6-8.2V (5.5x2.1mm round connector), USB-C 5V</li><li>LED power gauge lets you know where you battery\u2019s status, both charging and discharging</li><li>USB charging with overcharge protection</li><li>Battery has a tough polycarbonate shell with rubber bumpers to protect your frame</li><li>Tool-free mounts for your bars, helmet or your head with the included head strap</li></ul>",
