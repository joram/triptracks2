  "description": "<p>Beal\u00ae puts emphasis on building ropes that reduce overall impact forces. This moderately lightweight, thin rope is great for climbing longer pitches. The thin diameter reduces rope-drag, but does compromise slice-resistance and long-term durability. This rope also features Beal\u2019s Dry Cover treatment. This is not a conventional dry treatment but rather a chemical coating added to the sheath to protect against grit, grime, heat, and rubbing.</p><ul><li>Safe Control mid-sheath pattern change makes finding the centre point safe and quick</li><li>Unicore construction bonds the sheath and core so there should never be any sheath slippage</li><li>Dry Cover treatment on the sheath resists dust, humidity and abrasion and improves handling</li><li>Beal plants a tree for every rope sold</li></ul>",
