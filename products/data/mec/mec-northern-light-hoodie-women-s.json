  "description": "<p>A minimalist jacket that we kept intentionally simple. Pull on this warm layer for backcountry skiing, climbing or cold days anywhere. It's a function-first design, engineered to last, with a look that's more timeless than trendy. Blown in insulation in areas where you need mobility is light and breathes like down, but will prove more durable over seasons of use. The back, front and underarms use classic sheet insulation to surround your core with warmth. We first made the Northern Lite series back in 2001, so we can say with authority, that this re-invented style is a keeper too.</p><ul><li>Face fabric is lightweight 20-denier recycled nylon ripstop with DWR (durable water repellent) finish</li><li>60g EcoSoft recycled synthetic insulation is warm and compressible</li><li>Full-length front YKK zipper with internal storm flap and chinguard</li><li>Insulated zippered hand pockets. Left hand pocket doubles as a stuff sack</li><li>Elastic edge binding on cuffs and an adjustable hem seal out drafts</li></ul>",
