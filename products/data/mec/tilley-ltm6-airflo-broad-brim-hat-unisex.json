  "description": "<p>With a solid resume of adventures behind it, the Tilley Hat is a Canadian icon, and the bestselling Airflo Hat is no exception. UPF 50+ protection shields your head when there's no shade in sight, and a broad brim and DWR finish keep you dry when storm clouds gather. A stealthy pocket in the crown holds extra cash or your passport for those times you don't want to wear a money belt. A well-designed dual cord system keeps it on your head, even in the face of gale-force winds, but if you happen to drop it overboard, the wide foam brim keeps it afloat until you can retrieve it. If it gets a little squished in your suitcase or backpack, just pour a little water into the crown, swish it around, dampen the outside and reform with your hands to bring it back to its former shape.</p><ul><li>Durable nylon fabric has UPF 50+ sun protection and a DWR finish to shed light rain</li><li>Polyester mesh encircles the crown to vent hot air and keep your head cool and comfortable</li><li>Hydrofil\u00ae sweatband wicks moisture from your brow</li><li>Wide foam brim keeps hat afloat should it fall in the water</li><li>Hidden crown pocket keeps small essentials safe while travelling</li><li>Dual wind cord system keeps hat secure in gusty conditions</li></ul>",
