  "description": "<p>For the first time ever, Garmin\u2019s most accessible full-feature Forerunner is ready to help you train for your first triathlon. Multi-sport mode was previously reserved for the top tier Forerunners, but now the 255 can take you through a swim, bike, and run training session all within a single workout file. Equipped with Garmin\u2019s Elevate optical heart rate monitor, the 255 reads your pulse straight off your wrist, no need for a chest strap. Running metrics like speed and distance information are handled by the onboard GPS and internal accelerometers. These sensors all work together, turning your movement into data, making sure you get credit for all you do, in the gym, the pool and on the trails. The 255 can even give your training a soundtrack, with the ability to connect to multiple music services and storage for up to 500 songs. Having your phone on hand and connected via the free Garmin Connect app, opens a world of smartwatch functionality.
