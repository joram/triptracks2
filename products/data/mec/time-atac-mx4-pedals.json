  "description": "<p>Power through the climbs and bring your bike with you on those drops. If you\u2019re looking to get into clipless pedals, or just want a pair of clipless pedals that keep both the weight and the cost reasonable, look no further than the MX4. The wide stable platform gives you enough room to pedal when not clipped in, and has plenty of support around your forefoot for excellent power transfer. The open clip design clears dirt and debris with ease, so your clips work just like they should, regardless of the forecast.</p><ul><li>Glass fibre nylon composite is light and strong</li><li>Hollow steel axle keeps weight down and strength high</li><li>Wide angle step in design means less slips and more confidence</li><li>ATAC cleats clear your pedals of dirt and debris every time you step in</li><li>Includes ATAC standard cleats with a 13\u00b0 and 17\u00b0 release angle</li></ul>",
