  "description": "<p>Like the Grigri 2 but beefier for use with fat single ropes and to hold up to lots of use. Great for those learning to climb and belay, it offers a very controlled descent and has an anti-panic handle to stops the descent if the user pulls too hard. A stainless steel protector plate makes it durable, and a wide space between the cam and body reduces wear with heavily used or furred ropes.</p><ul><li>Anti-panic handle brakes and stops the descent if the user pulls too hard on the handle</li><li>Lockable selector lets\u00a0swap between top rope and lead modes</li><li>Aluminum side plates, stainless steel friction plate and wear plate, and reinforced nylon lowering handle for durability</li><li>Recommended for use with 8.9 \u2013 10.5mm diameter single ropes, but can also be used with ropes down to 8.5mm and up to 11mm</li><li>CE and EN certified</li></ul>",
