  "description": "<p>There are places you wouldn't dare venture without the warmest parkas. Inspired by the 1992 MEC St. Elias Parka, the APEX St. Elias is built to meet the demands of the most extreme conditions from Patagonia to it's namesake peak in Alaska, and everywhere in between. The shell combines two types of Pertex fabric, mapped to provide wind and water protection where you need it. Built to be our warmest and most packable backcountry parka, thanks to the 800-fill down in the torso, hood and sleeves, and synthetic insulation in areas where you risk building up moisture. Since you can't be on the sharp end all the time, a two-way zipper and helmet-compatible hood keep you as comfortable as possible while belaying on drippy ice or alpine routes.</p><ul><li>Lightweight nylon fabric is windproof and downproof</li><li>Pertex\u00ae Endurance ripstop with water-resistant PU coating on shoulders, hood, elbows and lower back</li><li>Insulated with warm and packable 800-fill power down that meets the Responsible Down Standard for animal welfare</li><li>Offset box baffle construction minimizes cold spots</li><li>80g Thermolite\u00ae Micro synthetic insulation in areas prone to moisture: cuffs, elbows, underarms, shoulders and front collar</li><li>Dual insulated storm flap (front and behind) reduces heat loss</li><li>Down-filled hood provides coverage without compromising vision</li><li>YKK \u00aeAquaguard\u00ae pocket zippers keep moisture out</li><li>Internal label shares the story and history behind the jacket</li><li>Included stuff sack stores fits in internal chest pocket</li></ul>",
