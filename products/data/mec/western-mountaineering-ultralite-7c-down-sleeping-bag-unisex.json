  "description": "<p>Ideal for cycling trips across varying climate zones and extended 3-season backpacking. Incredibly light and compressible, it's designed for thru hikers, climbers or other light and fast aficionados. The compromise for all its lightness is the durability of the shell and lining fabric. It's an ultralight, high-performance bag, not one for kicking-around or putting into continuous use, but treat it nicely and you'll be sleeping warm season after season.</p><ul><li>Shell and lining are incredibly light and compressible sub 12-denier ripstop nylon</li><li>Down-filled draft collar seals in warm air and eliminate drafts around the shoulders and neck</li><li>Continuous baffle construction (no sideblock baffle) and 5\u00bcin. baffle spacing offers down control and minimizes cold spots</li><li>Narrow profile offers a close fit for maximum heat efficiency</li><li>#5 YKK zipper</li><li>Dimensions provide room to sleep comfortably, but not enough to sprawl</li></ul>",
