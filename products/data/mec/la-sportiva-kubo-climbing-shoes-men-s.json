The Kubo have subtle asymmetry and a slight downturn for one-shoe quiver performance in most terrain. The supportive midsole and XS Grip rubber support your foot on small edges in near-vertical terrain, and the toe rubber and high-performance heel provide grip when heel or toe hooking in steep terrain.</p><ul><li>Leather and microfibre upper with opposing hook-and-loop closures for a precise fit</li><li>Cushioned tongue provides comfort on long days or in foot jams</li><li>Rubber toe patch grips to technical toe hooks</li><li>Full-length 1.1mm Laspoflex midsole provides maximum edging support</li><li>4mm Vibram\u00ae XS Edge\u2122 rubber outsole sticks to small edges</li><li>La Sportiva suggests downsizing 1-1.5 sizes (performance fit) or 0.5-1 sizes (comfort fit) from your street shoe size</li></ul>",
