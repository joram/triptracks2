  "description": "<p>A high-performance whitewater freestyle hull with secondary rails for harder carving.  High outer walls bring the volume close to the centre while providing good control through the thighs. This extra control lets you edge, carve and spin down waves. If you're looking for a whitewater feel, the thigh braces will really spice it up. It can be rolled, and can pull-off more advanced freestyle moves like airscrews and helixs. In short, this boat is super enjoyable and is very capable. For flat water lake paddle, local river run, and sunny surf at your favorite break, the Genesis is a solid choice.</p><ul><li>Made of high-density polyethylene that is super strong for better performance and a faster feel</li><li>Reactor outfitting system for comfort and functionality</li><li>Built-in thigh braces for a stiffer top deck</li><li>Adjust to the perfect fit with an adjustable seat pad for all-day comfort</li><li>HipFlex System with 3-way ratchet backband, to hold you in place via 3 contact points</li><li>Heel and toe foot pods allows for more control, regardless of your size</li></ul>",
