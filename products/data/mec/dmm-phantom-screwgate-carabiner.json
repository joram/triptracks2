  "description": "<p>The lightest keylock locking carabiner in the world (circa spring 2010). They're light, so you can bring some extras. For the size, this carabiner has strong open gate and cross-load breaking strength. The tradeoff is overall strength and durability, which won\u2019t be as great over the life of the carabiner.</p><ul><li>I-beam construction gives it a very impressive gate-face test of 4kN. This test pushes the gate face inward while locked</li><li>Constructed from hot-forged aluminum</li></ul>",
