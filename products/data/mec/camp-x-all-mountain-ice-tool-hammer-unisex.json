  "description": "<p>A good thing gets better. The popular X-All Mountain is a perfectly balanced, finely tuned tool. It suits technical ice and alpine routes where the ice may be thin or brittle. The pick penetrates without lots of displacement and the balanced head swings and sticks with a nice sharp \"thwak\". This model gets a slight tweak, with an updated multi-part head that can be customized with or without the hammer, depending on the needs of your route.</p><ul><li>7075-T6 aluminum shaft is T-rated for use on ice or rock</li><li>T-rated chromoly steel pick and tooth configuration works on all angles of ice</li><li>Modular head with interchangeable pick and hammer</li><li>3-part handle can be modified to suit terrain and adapted to fit a climber's hand size</li><li>Interchangeable spike is long enough for low angle glacier travel and has a hole for use with lanyards</li></ul>",
