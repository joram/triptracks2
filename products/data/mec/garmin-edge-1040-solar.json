  "description": "<p>Make the most of the sun's energy while you put down the power. Garmin has brought their Power Glass to the Edge series. Outfitted with two different solar panels, the Edge 1040 will let you spend a lot more time riding and a lot less time charging. On a sunny day the 1040 can deliver up to 40 minutes of charge time in just an hour of riding. An improved GPS chipset takes care of all of your speed and distance data. Free detailed maps make planning routes for your next ride, or your next tour, nice and simple. And an updated user interface and faster processor have made swiping through the 1040 more intuitive than ever.
