  "description": "<p>A trusty steed for the gravel curious road riders among us. On road or off, the Provincial Road 2\u2019s stability-focused steel frame is flickable and responsive. From tarmac focused group rides, to cyclocross and bikepacking, this bike is up for it. Like past Provincials, the Road 2 has impressive tire clearance, making it a great choice for touring on less than stellar terrain. The carbon fork uses a 12mm thru-axle instead of a standard QR set up, to reduce flex under hard braking, cornering and accelerating. A wide and supportive Fizik Terra saddle keeps you comfortable during those long rides. SRAM\u2019s solid Rival 1x groupset is paired with powerful hydraulic disc brakes, letting you keep your speed right where you want it, going up or down.</p><ul><li>Columbus Cromor steel frame with lowered bottom bracket for stable handling</li><li>Carbon fibre fork with aluminum steerer lower the weight of the bike while improving comfort</li><li>Front fork designed for use with 12mm thru axles</li><li>Frame is equipped with eyelets for fenders, a rear rack, and 3 bottle cages for those long adventures</li><li>Frame and fork have plenty of clearance, allowing for tires that measure up to 45mm in width</li><li>SRAM Rival 1x gruppo yields fast shifts and solid braking in a lightweight package</li><li>Hydraulic disc brakes provide outstanding power and modulation regardless of weather</li><li>SRAM Centerline 160mm rotors provide plenty of stopping power</li><li>SRAM Rival crank with a 42T chainring and huge 11-42T cassette means a gear range ready for every kind of ride</li><li>Formula hubs use sealed cartridge bearings for smoothness and durability</li><li>Easton EA50 bars features a 16\u00b0 flare for a comfortable and stable position on rough roads</li><li>Vittoria Terreno Dry tires are 40mm wide to soak up road and trail vibration</li><li>MEC carbon fibre post soaks up vibration for a comfortable ride</li><li>Fizik Terra Alpaca X5 is 145mm wide, comfortably cradling your sit bones on rough terrain and long rides</li><li>Bikes are covered by MEC's Rocksolid Guarantee and Bike Service Agreement.
