  "description": "<p>Get a clear view of where you\u2019re going, on the trail and on your fitness journey. By learning some of the best features from Garmin\u2019s f\u0113nix and Forerunner line, and tossing in a few new ones, the epix has evolved. One of the epix Pro\u2019s new features tackles the challenge of balancing GPS power and battery life. By matching your GPS signal to your terrain, SatIQ optimizes your runtime; flat land gets a low power signal, head into the mountains and your signal is boosted. The onboard multiband GPS pulls in speed, distance, and location data. While the optical heart rate monitor and other sensors pay attention to how you train. When your favourite runs feel too easy, Hill score shows you why, breaking down the evolution of your running power and endurance. On those days you want to train but don\u2019t have a workout in mind, the morning report is there. Each morning you get a summary of sleep quality, recovery level, training effects, and a personalized daily workout. When you need extra information, or motivation, you can download training plans through the free Garmin Connect app. And, classic smartwatch features help you stay connected, stream music, receive notifications, track the weather and more.</p><ul><li>AMOLED screen is easy to read in any light, with deep blacks and vibrant colours</li><li>Smaller case watches are more comfortable and provide a more accurate heart rate signal on smaller wrists</li><li>Lightweight titanium bezel is paired with a virtually scratchproof sapphire crystal face</li><li>Preloaded with routable North American TopoActive maps, with other regions available for free download</li><li>Built-in activity modes for biking, running, walking, multisport, swimming (indoor and outdoor), gym activities, skiing (2000+ ski resort maps) and more</li><li>Activity animations guide you through proper form for strength training, cardio, Pilates and yoga</li><li>Multi-band signal reception and expanded GNSS support (GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, QZSS and IRNSS) provide faster and more accurate positioning and elevation data</li><li>SatIQ\u2122 matches your current environment with the right GPS mode, optimizing battery life</li><li>Internet Live Tracking during activities (via a phone) allows you to share your location and metrics</li><li>Round-trip mapping: enter a distance and the epix Pro will use tracks from other Garmin users to calculate multiple course options that start and stop right were you are</li><li>Trendline\u2122 routing uses Garmin Connect\u2019s database of routes and finds the most popular way to get you where you are going</li><li>Hill score displays your running strength and endurance, tracking your progress over time</li><li>Endurance score analyzes training data to map improvements to your overall endurance</li><li>Morning report summarizes sleep quality, recovery level, training effects, and provides a personalized daily workout</li><li>Training readiness, training status, and training load modes use data from your recent workouts to let you know how ready your body is to train, and if you are overtraining, under-training, or on the right path</li><li>Acute load compares recent workouts against your fitness level and training schedule, keeping you on track to reach your goals</li><li>Running dynamics info provides running power, cadence, stride length, vertical oscillation, vertical ratio and ground contact time</li><li>Mountain biking dynamics include specific metrics, jumps: hangtime, distance and speed, grit: overall trail difficulty, and flow: a score of how smoothly you rode the trail</li><li>Elevate\u2122 optical heart rate monitor for constant heart rate and pulse ox data</li><li>Physiological metrics includes VO2 max, an improved race predictor, recovery advisor, real-time stamina tracking, and performance indicator</li><li>Heart rate variability (HRV) is a great tool to predict recovery and training response</li><li>Body Battery\u2122 tracks daily energy levels, monitoring what drains your energy (exercise) and recharges your energy (rest, food)</li><li>Incident detection: in the case of an accident the unit will send a signal through your phone to your emergency contacts, letting them know where you are and that you need help</li><li>Stream music via a paired phone using Spotify, Deezer, or Amazon Music.
