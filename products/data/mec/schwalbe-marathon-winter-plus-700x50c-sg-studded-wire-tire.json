The spikes work best on ice when running at minimum pressure. At maximum pressure, the tires can be ridden on ice-free roads with minimal noise.</p><ul><li>RaceGuard belt offers protects against penetration punctures, while only minimally increasing weight and rolling resistance</li><li>Reflective lines for visibility on long winter nights</li><li>Spikes have a tungsten carbide core for durability</li><li>To ensure that spikes are permanently fixed, tires should be run in for about 40km on asphalt while avoiding any fast acceleration or heavy braking</li></ul>",
