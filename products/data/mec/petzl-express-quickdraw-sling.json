The Petzl Express runners are made of 25mm flat webbing, with loops at either end to accommodate carabiners. The ends have been tapered to nestle nicely into the carabiner frames.</p><ul><li>Available in 11, 17, or 25cm lengths</li><li>Integrated rubber STRING protector reduces twisting and helps to maintain the rope-end carabiner orientation</li></ul>",
