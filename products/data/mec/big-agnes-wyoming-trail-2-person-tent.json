  "description": "<p>Think about your home. What\u2018s bigger? The bedroom, or the living room, kitchen and dining room combined? Exactly. The Wyoming Trail 2 follows the same logic. One vestibule is super-sized, so you have lots of space to cook, eat, store gear and hang out with the dog. You don't have to worry about spills inside the tent or getting your sleeping bags damp and dirty. Plus, you can use your trekking poles to rig the vestibule door as an awning for views and ventilation.</p><ul><li>All seams are taped with waterproof, solvent-free polyurethane tape</li><li>2 awning doors and oversized vestibule allow easy entry and exit whichever side you\u2019re sleeping on</li><li>Webbing on tent corners with reflective guy lines to prevent tripping in the dark</li><li>Press-fit pole connectors, colour-coded ends and webbing, and plastic buckles are fast to set up</li><li>High volume pole structure creates near vertical side walls and interior volume</li><li>Includes 11 Dirt Dagger UL stakes</li><li>2 interior mesh pockets and 4 corner pockets for organizing small essentials</li><li>Optional footprint available for floor protection. (Sold separately)</li><li>Compatible with Big Agnes Triangle Gear Lofts (Sold separately)</li></ul>",
