  "description": "<p>For all round camp use, whittling, and food preparation this traditional folding pocket knife is a proven performer. The stainless steel blade is relatively maintenance free, though it is harder to sharpen than carbon steel. The thumbnail slot can be used to open the blade. A slotted stainless steel clip securely locks the blade open or closed. The contoured hardwood handle feels comfortable in the hand.</p>",
