  "description": "<p>Wherever your powder-seeking soul takes you, these performance boots want to go too. A lightweight polyurethane shell provides shock absorption and vibration dampening for extended shredding, booting and more shredding. A compact ski/hike mechanism provides hiking comfort without sacrificing downhill performance, rigidity and responsiveness. Soles are replaceable and provide you with a super-durable surface for walking in snow or otherwise. Ready to shred right out of the box, the liners gradually conform to the contours of your foot, or you can heat mould them for a lived-in feel on day 1.</p><ul><li>Polyurethane shell with polyamide composite cuff offers a great stiffness to weight ratio</li><li>PuRE (Polyurethane Recycled Enforcement) technology delivers efficient power transmission to the shell</li><li>Pebax\u00ae Rnew\u2122 tongue is made from fully recycled materials and provides progressive flex with all-day comfort</li><li>3DWRAP Max Hike liner provides excellent heel support and mobility around the ankles</li><li>AUTOFIT technology with memory foam tongue can adapt to any foot shape</li><li>Three-part LV Cabrio platform ensures uniform flex</li><li>Cabrio ski-walk mode makes it easy to switch between ascent and descent modes</li><li>3 lightweight aluminum micro buckles with a 50mm power strap for a precise and secure fit</li></ul>",
