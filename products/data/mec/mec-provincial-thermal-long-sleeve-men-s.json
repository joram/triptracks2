  "description": "<p>Misty mornings, lonely forest roads, mountain passes... it's funny how some of the most beautiful cycling settings also happen to be the chilliest. Sitting right in between a softshell and a long sleeve jersey, the Provincial Thermal is warm, soft, and has excellent wicking performance, letting you absorb the moment in comfort. Its close-to-the-body fit is ideal for touring, randonneuring and relaxed cool-weather club rides. And spacious drop-in pockets, let you carry all you need for those all-day epics.</p><ul><li>Recycled polyester fleece is warm and wicking, with a soft, brushed finish</li><li>Full length zip lets you vent extra heat</li><li>Comfortable chinguard, keeps the zipper off your chin while tucking into the drop bars</li><li>3 drop-in back pockets have enough room for snacks, an extra bottle, light jacket and the always nearby banana</li><li>Reflective details on sleeves and back help keep you seen</li><li>Dropped hem ensures good lower back coverage when in riding position</li><li>Bottom hem has a wide, soft silicone band to prevent riding up</li><li>Fit is close to the body but not skin-tight for riding comfort</li></ul>",
