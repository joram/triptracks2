  "description": "<p>Not into long descents? Or always riding in the cold? Then these non-finned pads for Shimano\u2019s 4-piston calipers should be all you need.  Updated with a new resin compound, these pads last up to 50% longer than the previous generation. Compared to metal pads, the resin compound is quiet, generates less heat, and offers more progressive stopping power (no sudden braking). The only compromise? Resin has a shorter lifespan than metal, especially under wet conditions.</p><ul><li>3rd generation resin compound lasts 90% longer than 1st generation and 50% longer than 2nd generation</li><li>Comes with 1 left and 1 right pad, and 1 spring for 1 set of brakes</li><li>To replace both front and rear brakes, you will require 2 sets of these brake pads</li><li>Compatible with DEORE XT M8100 series, DEORE XT M8000 series, SLX M7100 series, DEORE M6100 series, DEORE M5100 series, SAINT M820 series, SAINT M810 series, ZEE M640 series, CUES U8000 series</li></ul>",
