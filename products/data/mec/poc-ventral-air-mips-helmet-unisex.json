  "description": "<p>Light, cool, and aerodynamic, all great qualities for a road helmet. Using a series of precise ventilation ports and internal air channels the Ventral Air helps you keep a cool head, at any speed. Riders who chase watts will appreciate the helmet's 22\u00b0 trailing edge, a minor detail that reduces turbulence and drag. Extensive CFD testing and technical construction allows the Ventral Air beautifully balance protection and aerodynamics. Based in Sweden, POC has been making cutting edge personal safety equipment for snowsports and cycling for nearly two decades.</p><ul><li>MIPS Integra (Multi-directional Impact Protection System) reduces rotational forces in an oblique impact. The Integra system uses moving pads instead of a moving inner liner. These pads provide the same level of protection as a standard MIPS liner, but take up less space and allows for more ventilation</li><li>Grippy in the forward-facing vents give you a secure place to store your glasses when you don't need them</li><li>Internal air channels reduce drag and maximize cooling</li><li>Adjustable fit system lets you dial in your perfect fit</li><li>Extended protection wraps around the base of the skull</li><li>Lightweight straps are easy to adjust, and super comfy</li><li>The bright orange colourway is part of POC\u2019s Attention, Visibility, Interaction, and Protection (AVIP) initiative, designed to maximize cyclist visibility</li></ul>",
