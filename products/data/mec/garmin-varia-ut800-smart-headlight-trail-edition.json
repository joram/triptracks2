  "description": "<p>The faster you go, the further your light shines. Mounting directly on your helmet, the Trail version of the UT800 is like wearing headlamp while you ride, illuminating every rock and root you look at. By talking with your Edge\u00ae cycling computer, the Varia UT800 knows your speed and surrounding light conditions. It takes this data and adjusts its brightness automatically \u2013 the darker or faster you go, the brighter it gets, the brighter your surroundings or the slower you go, the dimmer it gets. And, if you want to use the UT800 on its own, you can, it has 5 modes you can cycle through manually.</p><ul><li>Pairs with Edge cycling computers, f\u0113nix\u00ae watches, and other Garmin devices, over ANT+ for smart brightness adjustability based on your speed and ambient lighting conditions</li><li>5 modes: 800 lumens (1.5h), 400 lumens (3h), 200 lumens (6h), day flash 700 lumens (25h) and night flash (pulse) 300-100 lumens (6h)</li><li>Wide beam pattern optimized for trail riding, but great in urban environments too</li><li>270\u00b0 of visibility with side light ports that help keep you seen</li><li>LED battery power indicator displays batter status, both charging and discharging, battery status is also displayed on a paired Edge</li><li>Easy USB charging</li><li>IPX7 water resistance means the light keeps shining in even the heaviest downpours</li><li>In the box: Varia UT800, helmet mount, charging cable and documentation</li></ul>",
