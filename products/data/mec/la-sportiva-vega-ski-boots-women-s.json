  "description": "<p>An alpine touring boot that offers fantastic downhill performance. The Vega takes all the genius of La Sportiva\u2019s Spectre 2.0 and improves both stiffness and flex. A 2-layer tongue locks together in ski mode but moves freely in touring mode. Carbon reinforcement behind the cuff ups the stiffness at 125 flex, so you get power and precision comparable to a downhill boot. The EZ Tech buckle locking system is easy to use and adjust in the field. A thermoformable liner adds warmth and comfort and a Vibram\u00ae outsole adds durable grip.</p><ul><li>Shell has a compact lower made of ultra-lightweight nylon polymer Grilamid\u00ae</li><li>Cuff is made of Pebax and supported by the carbon reinforced Grilamid vertebra</li><li>Rear spoiler provides fine-tuning of forward lean angle and foot position</li><li>Double Power Grilamid tongue uses interlocking layers to promote flexibility when walking and stiffness when skiing</li><li>Vega Liner provides more warmth and comfort when charging hard</li><li>Vibram outsole has 2 compounds to blend grip and durability</li><li>Dynamic Power Strap\u00ae helps further increase the stiffness of the boot</li><li>4 EZ-Tech Aluminum buckles provide a strong hold and are micro-adjustable for a perfect fit</li><li>Walk/ski mechanism is easy to operate, even with gloves on</li><li>Flex Index of 125 provides great downhill performance</li><li>Compatible bindings are Tech and Alpine touring</li></ul>",
