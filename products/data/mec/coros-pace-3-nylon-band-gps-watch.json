  "description": "<p>By swapping the silicone strap for a nylon strap, Coros has turned their already lightweight Pace 3 into a featherweight. The latest generation of Coros\u2019 budget-friendly multisport watch gets improved GPS, a touchscreen, and a more precise heart rate monitor. The Pace 3\u2019s biggest win comes from the dual frequency GPS, by tapping into more satellites, the watch gets a more accurate and reliable signal, especially in challenging terrain. You see these GPS benefits in precise tracks and a stronger connection under heavy tree cover and in dense cities. The touchscreen allows you swipe around your preloaded courses, while the signature dial lets you zoom in and out, making it easy to review your route with a single finger. By adding additional sensors to the optical heart rate monitor, your heart rate data is more complete than ever and adds the ability to track blood oxygen levels. And when you want even more, you can synch with the free COROS app to build, share and download custom routes and workouts, review activities, receive texts, social media alerts and email.</p><ul><li>Dual frequency GNSS support, connecting to GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou and QZSS satellite constellations providing faster and more accurate positioning and elevation data</li><li>Sport profiles include: running (indoor and outdoor), cycling (indoor and outdoor), swimming (pool and open water), triathlon, multisport, gym cardio, strength training and more</li><li>Multisport lets you transition and track different activities within a single workout</li><li>Strength training program has more than 200 exercises, selectable muscle groups, auto-detects reps, counts sets and provides a comprehensive breakdown in the app with body-mapped exercise tracking, including how many reps you did for each muscle group</li><li>Updated optical heart rate monitor measures heart rate right off your wrist and even works while swimming</li><li>Recovery advisor prevents over-training and helps maximize training intervals</li><li>Advanced training metrics: SpO2, VO2max, training effect, training load, threshold pace and more</li><li>Music playback via the internal storage, letting you drag-and-drop owned .mp3 files from your computer to your watch.
