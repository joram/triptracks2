With its large surface area, the tarp makes it easy to keep your ropes off the ground and out of the dirt, dust, and other craggy contaminants. Once you are ready to go, just roll the Trapper up, cinch the strap, and stuff it in your bag.</p><ul><li>2 tie off points for keeping track of the end of your ropes</li><li>Single roll-up strap with rugged metal hardware</li><li>Ripstop nylon construction is light, tough, and smooth \u2013 so it slides easily into your pack</li><li>Dimensions: 1.2 x 1.5m (4 x 5ft.)</li></ul>",
