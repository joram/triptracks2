  "description": "<p>Prevention is always your first and best defence against a bear attack. This little bell gives bears a chance to hear you coming, and to avoid you if they wish. Its metallic ring, a sound not found in nature, may cause bears to amble away rather than investigate.</p><ul><li>Strap with hook-and-loop attachment fixes easily to packs, clothing, poles, etc</li><li>Comes in a variety of colours, and you won't be able to choose. Life is so uncertain</li></ul>",
