  "description": "<p>Just like you, the Tacx Flux Trainer is getting stronger over time. It's now upgraded with a heavier flywheel to give it a more realistic road feel. The resistance got a tweak to make sure you never reach its max level. At maximum 2000 Watts and 16% simulated incline, it's a given that you'll tap out long before the trainer does. Design-wise, it also has lowered front legs so it clears long-cage derailleurs.</p><ul><li>Direct drive trainer ensures that every Watt you generate is accounted for</li><li>8 permanent ferrite magnets and 8 electromagnets</li><li>Power reading accuracy of +/- 2.5% requires calibration for best results</li><li>Maximum brake power of 2000W</li><li>Heavy 7.6kg (18.8lbs.) flywheel, with a flywheel effect of 31.2kg (68.8lbs.) for a road-like feel</li><li>Cassette body fits Shimano and SRAM 8, 9, 10 & 11 speed cassettes. Campagnolo, SRAM XD and XD-R cassette bodies are sold separately. Not suitable for specialized SCS system</li><li>Cassette not included, sold separately</li><li>Compatible with 130mm and 135mm quick release axles</li><li>Adaptors included for 142x12mm and 148x12mm axles included. Adaptors for 10x135 sold separately</li><li>Realistic slope simulation of up to 16%</li><li>ERG mode allows you to maintain effort level regardless of your cadence</li><li>LEDs confirm ANT+ and Bluetooth connection</li><li>FE-C and Bluetooth smart control allows you to focus on your training and let an app change the resistance</li><li>Controllable by Tacx app, Zwift, TrainerRoad, Kinomap and many others</li><li>Large, well-balanced footprint of 67 x 64.2cm (26.4 x 25.3in.)</li></ul>",
