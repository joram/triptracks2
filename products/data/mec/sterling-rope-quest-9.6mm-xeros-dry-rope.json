  "description": "<p>One rope to do it all, the Quest is a lightweight workhorse with low impact forces and a full dry treatment for sport, trad and ice lines. It has a firm hand for easy clipping and a smooth sheath that glides through gear and over rock. The new XEROS dry technology is applied when the nylon is still a filament, treating the entire rope from core to sheath, and resulting in less waste and energy use than traditional treatments.</p><ul><li>XEROS permanent dry treatment is applied to nylon filaments before they're twisted into yarns. This results in less water absorption through the entire rope and prevents freezing in cold environments</li><li>Made with PFOA-free, PFAS-free, and bluesign\u00ae certified raw materials</li><li>High sheath proportion adds durability</li><li>Middle mark increases safety and speed on rappels</li></ul>",
