  "description": "<p>Rock, paper, scissors. Win and you get the plum pitches, lose and you\u2019re on belay duty. Either way, you're racking up at the base of a route, so everyone is happy. The RPS Pants are made of durable soft shell, excellent for summer alpine routes as it blocks wind and sheds water with a DWR finish. Articulated knees and a gusseted crotch facilitate high stepping and drop-knee moves, while the Patagonia OppoSet waist customizes the fit and slides under a harness or hipbelt. Back pockets reinforce the seat, front pockets are mesh-lined for ventilation and a thigh pocket is accessible under a harness.</p><ul><li>Made of nylon and polyester stretch-woven soft shell with DWR finish and mechanical stretch</li><li>Zippered fly and belt loops, with Patagonia OppoSet waist adjustment that's customizable and sits comfortably under a waistbelt</li><li>Drop-in hand pocket have breathable mesh pocket liners and darts for lay-flat entry</li><li>Back pockets reinforce the seat and add durability</li><li>Right thigh pocket sits above the knee and below the leg loops</li><li>Adjustable leg cuffs have low-profile shockcord and sliding knot to secure them over your boots</li></ul>",
