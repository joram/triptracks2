  "description": "<p>A further refinement of the Direto XR, Elite\u2019s latest direct drive trainer delivers a smoother and quieter ride that ever before. Updated with a heavier flywheel, flex feet that let you enjoy the natural sway of a ride, and Bluetooth hub functionality, the Justo is worthy of sitting at the top of Elite\u2019s trainer line. Controllable via apps and software the Justo reproduces the actual challenge of the course you're riding. With a maximum incline of 24%, you can test yourself against the hardest sections of Alto de L'Angliru from the comfort of home. If you're a green jersey type, there are up to 2300W of resistance (at 40km/h), so you get the most from your out the saddle sprints. If you're going to put the effort in to follow a power-based training program, power accuracy of 1% puts you on par with the top-tier standalone power meters. When you don\u2019t feel like riding in an app, or maybe you\u2019re caught in a power outage, there are even 2 stand alone modes that let you set the resistance through My E-Training app on your phone.</p><ul><li>Direct drive trainer ensures that every watt you generate is accounted for \u2013 and no more worn trainer tires</li><li>Quiter than ever, essentially all you hear is your drivetrain</li><li>Flex feet provide dynamic riding experience, 2 types of feet included: red are softer for more movement, black are firmer for a more stable ride</li><li>Optical Torque Sensor (OTS) provides precise power measurement within +/- 1%.
