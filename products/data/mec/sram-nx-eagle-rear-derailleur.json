  "description": "<p>1 x 12s are the dream drive train for most trail and all mountain riders out there.  Formerly, 1 x 12 drivetrains were only available on the best-of-the-best bikes and came at hefty cost. But the NX line now reaps the benefits of trickle down technology. It uses different materials to create the same crisp, smooth and reliable shifting performance as the XX1 derailleur, but in a much more affordable package.</p><ul><li>X-Horizon movement only allows horizontal movement to prevent ghost shifting</li><li>Type-3 Roller Bearing Clutch\u2122 eliminates chain slap and derailleur bounce, without impacting shifting precision</li><li>Cage Lock make wheel removal and chain installation a breeze</li><li>14-tooth X-SYNC\u2122 pulley wheels</li><li>Fully compatible with all SRAM 1x\u2122 drivetrains</li></ul>",
