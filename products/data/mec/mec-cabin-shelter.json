Seam-sealed roof helps you laugh at the rain, and big mesh doors and side panels let the view in.</p><ul><li>Main fabric is 75-denier polyester with a waterproof coating - the same stuff we use on our backpacking tents!</li><li>Poles attach with a mix of sleeves, clips, and hook and loop straps to create a strong structure</li><li>Generous mesh panels keep bugs out and let you enjoy the views. When it rains, deploy the removable waterproof side panels to wait out the deluge</li><li>Huge double doors on each side have a waterproof fabric layer that rolls up out of the way when unzipped, and a bug-proof mesh layer</li><li>Tie the fabric door panels out to trees, paddles or tarp poles (sold separately) to create awnings</li><li>Floor-free design means no worries about cooking spills. Weather skirts around the bottom keep the wind from getting underneath</li><li>4 interior pockets keep you organized</li><li>Includes a duffle bag-style carry bag, a pole sack with integrated instruction sheet, and 6 stakes</li></ul>",
