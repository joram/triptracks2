Smaller than most hatchets, the Balta is just right for cutting and splitting kindling into campfire fuel. An integrated hammer head means no more looking for the right rock when pounding tent pegs into hard ground, making this hatchet more than just a tool for feeding the fire.</p><ul><li>420 stainless steel blades holds and edge well and is easy to sharpen</li><li>Full-tang construction add rigidity and strength</li><li>Hammer striker for driving stakes into hardpack</li><li>Stake puller in the pommel</li><li>Nylon handle has rubber inserts for grip and shock absorption</li><li>Plastic mask style sheath has an integrated clip for easy carry</li></ul>",
