  "description": "<p>Filter water faster with minimal pumping effort. This lightweight, ultra-compact, high-flow system filters down to 0.2 micron, removing 99.99% of all bacteria and protozoa. The output is a considerable 2.75L of water per minute.</p><ul><li>Hollow fibre technology uses proprietary polymer fibres to create a high surface-area filter that allows water to flow quickly through a 0.2 micron effective pore size</li><li>A quick-connect adapter attaches the filter to any bottle or reservoir with a standard 63mm threaded opening</li><li>The polycarbonate filter body is tough, compact and light in weight</li><li>Silicon input hose with pre-filter</li><li>Field maintainable, can be easily reconfigured to allow backflushing for flow recovery. No tools required for complete disassembly</li><li>Note: These fibres are slightly more brittle than other filter materials and somewhat more susceptible to damage from strong impact. Although the cartridge is protected by the polycarbonate pump body and has been drop-tested to three feet, you should consider carrying a spare cartridge on long trips \u2013 they are small, light, and relatively inexpensive. Do not allow the cartridge to freeze after initial use</li></ul>",
