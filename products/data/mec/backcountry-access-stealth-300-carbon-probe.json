  "description": "<p>Get the benefits of a probe that is long enough for deep snowpacks without excess weight in your pack, thanks to carbon construction. The Stealth 300 Carbon does away with the dangling pull-cable found on other probes. In its place, there\u2019s a tube nested into the first probe section. It makes it smaller in your pack, and quick to deploy just pull the trigger and the probe extends to its full 300cm.</p><ul><li>Quick-Lock hardware allows for packability and fast deployment speed</li><li>Tip penetrates debris easily</li></ul>",
