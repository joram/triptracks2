Plus, since it\u2019s inflatable, you can roll it up, toss it in your adventure wagon and take off to your next paddle spot. This shorter length paddleboard suits lighter paddlers.</p><ul><li>Inflates to 20PSI for flex-free performance</li><li>Double sidewalls with PVC drop-stitch construction stands up to abrasion and abuse</li><li>Axis acrylic stiffener integrated into the deck improves performance without adding weight or making the board hard to roll up</li><li>Grippy foam deck keeps you onboard through rough waters and radical manoeuvres</li><li>7 D-rings to attach lots of gear</li><li>4 webbing handles for carrying or getting back on the board from the water</li><li>Nylon fins flex to absorb impacts.
