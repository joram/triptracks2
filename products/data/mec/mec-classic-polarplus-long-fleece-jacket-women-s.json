  "description": "<p>We took inspiration from a perennial favourite (the 1993 Cornice Jacket) and seriously amped up the cozy factor. The modern longer cut makes it feel like you\u2019re wrapped in a toasty fleece blanket. But make no mistake, the 90s vibe is still here: elbow patches, colour pops, and high collar.</p><ul><li>High-pile fleece is warm and won\u2019t pill</li><li>Reinforced elbows add wear resistance</li><li>2-way zipper makes it easy to sit down</li><li>Sneaky zippered chest pocket</li><li>Cuff gussets and drawcord hem seal warmth in</li></ul>",
