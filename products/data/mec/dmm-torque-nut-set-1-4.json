  "description": "<p>Torque Nuts fits well in standard crack placements, but they have the extra advantage of camming into position if you place them in a horizontal. They work in straight-sided cracks, and are way lighter than a full rack of big-crack cams. Doubled slings allow them to ride high when they are racked, but reduce drag when extended.</p><ul><li>Aluminum alloy head and sling are colour-coded</li><li>Recessed heads prevent abrasion of the sling</li><li>Dyneema bartack is shrink wrapped for extra protection</li><li>Tapered shape provides a wide range of placement options</li></ul>",
