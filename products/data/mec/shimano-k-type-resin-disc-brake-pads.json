  "description": "<p>Not into long descents? Or always riding in the cold? Then these non-finned pads for Shimano\u2019s 2-piston road and gravel calipers should be all you need. Updated with a new resin compound, these pads last up to 50% longer than the previous generation. Compared to metal pads, the resin compound is quiet, generates less heat, and offers more progressive stopping power (no sudden braking). The only compromise? Resin has a shorter lifespan than metal, especially under wet conditions.</p><ul><li>3rd generation resin compound lasts 90% longer than 1st generation and 50% longer than 2nd generation</li><li>Comes with 1 left and 1 right pad, and 1 spring for 1 set of brakes</li><li>To replace both front and rear brakes, you will require 2 sets of these brake pads</li><li>Fits all Shimano flat mount gravel & road disc calipers, including Dura Ace BR-R9170, Ultegra BR-R8070, 105 BR-R7070, GRX BR-RX810, BR-RX400 and XTR BR-M9100 calipers</li><li>Interchangeable with L-type finned pads</li></ul>",
