  "description": "<p>A replacement filter cartridge for the Platypus\u00ae Gravityworks Filter. Removes 99.9999% of all bacteria and protozoa.</p><ul><li>Hollow fibre technology uses proprietary polymer fibres to create a high surface-area filter that allows water to flow quickly through a 0.2 micron effective pore size.\nNominal 1500L filter life is for clear water, turbidity will reduce its useful life to 1000 to 1200L</li><li>Note: these fibres are slightly more brittle than other filter materials, and somewhat more susceptible to damage from strong impact. Although the cartridge is encased in a protective rubberized shell, and drop-tested to seven feet, you should consider carrying a spare cartridge on long trips. Do not allow the cartridge to freeze after initial use</li></ul>",
