  "description": "<p>With its technical construction and minimalist aesthetic, the Therme is right at home in city winters. Supple 2-layer GORE-TEX\u2122 outer-layer is fully waterproof, breathable and windproof, yet maintains a lightly textured natural feel. Down Composite Mapping\u2122 is used throughout, blending pillowy down and Coreloft insulation. Mapping maximizes the jacket\u2019s ability to keep you warm and reduces its overall bulk.
