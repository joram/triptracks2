  "description": "<p>Hard wearing trail shoes that feel like runners. Inspired by the sock-knit construction found on modern trainers, the Accomplice uses an innovative tongue to cradle your foot, resulting in some of the comfiest trail shoes on the market. Ride Concepts built these shoes to last, tough nylon uppers aren\u2019t afraid of rock gardens or even the odd pedal bite (better the shoe than you). The grippy rubber outsole hangs onto your pedal\u2019s pins helping you stay connected to your bike on rough terrain and in the air. The tread also offers great grip, which is nice to have when walking features, and the flat tread pattern works well for stomping down berms.</p><ul><li>Rugged nylon uppers dry quickly and let your feet breathe</li><li>Suede reinforcement around the lace eyelets increase durability</li><li>Added TPU protection at the base of the shoe</li><li>Elastic lace pouch keeps your laces out of your drivetrain</li><li>4-way stretch slip tongue hugs your foot while keeping debris out</li><li>Supportive dual-density EVA insole</li><li>Low-volume design with tailored padding around the toe and collar</li><li>Nylon shank adds stiffness for improved power transfer</li><li>Grippy rubber soles offer a secure connection with pedal pins</li><li>Deeply lugged sole with reverse lugs at the heel and toe for comfortable walking and traction while hike-a-biking</li></ul>",
