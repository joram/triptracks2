  "description": "<p>Looks like a normal chain, but the design offers a gear range previously found only in 2-chainring drivetrains. Ultra-smooth, precise, durable and quiet, the Eagle\u2019s links have a smooth radius, with no sharp edges or chamfers, the things that cause noise, friction and wear on your chainrings and cassette cogs. This design also allows for a flatter plate for more consistent chain riveting and greater overall strength.</p><ul><li>Smooth radius links reduce friction and wear</li><li>Hard Chrome technology improves wear resistance on the inner links. Outer links are nickel plated</li><li>Powerlock chain connector for better chain guiding and longevity</li><li>Chrome hardened hollow pins keeps the weight low</li><li>126 links</li></ul>",
