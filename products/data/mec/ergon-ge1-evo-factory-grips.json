Developed in partnership with Ergon\u2019s Enduro World Series athletes, the GE1 Evo grips pair perfectly with wide aggressive bars, giving you maximum control. When you pull into the GE1, your upper body is naturally drawn into \u201cready position\u201d, so you\u2019re ready to flow with the trail.</p><ul><li>Ergon\u2019s Factory rubber is softer and tackier than their standard compound</li><li>Upper grip texture maximizes dampening and grip</li><li>Lower grip texture keeps you connected while requiring minimum pressure needed to keep you locked in</li><li>Moulded thumb zone supports your thumb and improves responsiveness while making minor course corrections</li><li>Textured cutouts rotate against your natural grip, increasing your connection</li><li>Flared outer edge encourages even pressure distribution and reduces force on the ulnar nerve</li><li>Single lockring for easy installation</li><li>Lasered indicators on the lockring help you dial in your cockpit</li></ul>",
