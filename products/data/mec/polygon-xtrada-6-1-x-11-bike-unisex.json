  "description": "<p>If 11 gears seem like plenty, the Xtrada 6 is a great way to hit the trails and save money. With 1 less gear than its elder sibling, the Xtrada 6 is a great value. Outfitted with RST front suspension, you get the best of both worlds, with a lockout for the climbs and rebound adjustment for the descents. The 11-speed Shimano Deore drivetrain has lots of mechanical advantage to take the edge off of steep climbs. From its modern geometry, to its grippy Entity tires, this hardtail is a solid way to start exploring the world of mountain biking.</p><ul><li>ALX Alloy frame is uses hydro-formed, triple butted 6061 aluminum that has been heat treated for improved strength and durability</li><li>Tapered head tube broadens towards the bottom leading to better force transfer from the fork to the frame. The increased stiffness of the tapered head tube provides improved handling</li><li>RST Omega front fork has 120mm of coil-sprung travel, a lockout for climbing and rebound adjustment for that glued to the ground feeling</li><li>Shimano Deore 1 x 11 drivetrain is rugged, reliable, and affordable, providing fast accurate shifts even in rough terrain</li><li>Shimano hydraulic disc brakes offer precise speed control in all conditions</li><li>Internal cable routing keeps your cables safe from trail hazards and has a nice clean look</li><li>Polygon\u2019s wheel fit system equips small bikes with 27.5in. wheels, and medium to extra large bikes with 29in. wheels.

You can bring your bike to any MEC bike shop for free adjustments and minor maintenance for a year after purchase</li><li>Based in Indonesia, Polygon has been making bikes for more than 25 years.
