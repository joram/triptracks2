  "description": "<p>Stop choosing between the \"built for dudes\" version of a ski, or the \"overcooked noodle\" option that doesn't have the right flex and balance for women. Coalition Snow made a ski that's amazing for female shredders. The SOS is a one-quiver-ski that floats on powder days and holds an edge when playing on the resort runs. The full birch wood core adds dampness, provides a solid flex and holds up well in all the chopped and glopped conditions you might encounter.</p><ul><li>Slanted ABS sidewalls reduce the swing weight for manoevrability</li><li>Triaxial fibreglass offers a good balance of flex and torsional control</li><li>Full birch wood core absorbs vibration and provides solid flex at high speed</li><li>Sandwich construction brings playful energy and rebound</li><li>3 point sidecut creates a ski that feels shorter than it is on hardpack</li><li>Early rise in the tip and tail improves floatation and offers easy turn initiation</li><li>Traditional camber underfoot for powerful, confidence inspiring turns on boilerplate</li><li>Sintered 7500 base has great wax retention for a fast ride</li></ul>",
