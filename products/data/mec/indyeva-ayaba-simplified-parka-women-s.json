  "description": "<p>Designed with the coldest-of-the-cold Canadian city winters in mind, this coat stands up to winter\u2019s worst moods. An update to one of Indyeva\u2019s classic designs, this simplified version of the Ayaba focuses on the essentials, like coziness. Using the same plush blend of pillowy down and lofty feathers, this parka wraps you in channels of warm air. Extra puff has even added where you need it \u2013 shoulders, sleeves, and cuffs. The waterproof-breathable laminate is totally windproof to buffer gusts when you turn the corner into a windy city street.</p><ul><li>Bluesign\u00ae approved nylon has a cotton-like feel</li><li>Waterproof-breathable laminate in 2-layer construction</li><li>Durable water repellent (DWR) finish to shed water and snow</li><li>Insulated with a blend of 700-fill power white duck down (80%) and feathers (20%) that are sourced under the Responsible Down Standard</li><li>Indyeva has designed this coat for warmth when it dips to -30\u00b0C</li><li>High pile fleece lining at the back and on the inside of the collar amps up the coziness</li><li>2-way zipper opens from the bottom so you can sit down easily</li><li>Insulated hood keeps you warm when you forget your toque, or warmer when you have your toque</li><li>Inside zippered pocket keeps your phone\u2019s battery safe from the cold</li><li>Zippered handwarmer pockets with fleece lining</li><li>Slightly dropped hem provides a little extra coverage (centre back length is 35in. and centre front length is 35in.)</li></ul>",
