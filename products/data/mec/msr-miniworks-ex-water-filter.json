  "description": "<p>The MSR\u00ae Miniworks\u2122 EX water filter is lightweight, with the same easy pumping action and carbon-cored ceramic element as the MSR WaterWorks\u2122 EX filter, but without the final membrane filter. The side-mounted lever is easier to use than bike-pump-type filters. The base of the filter is threaded to screw directly onto Nalgene\u00ae wide-mouth water bottles or all MSR Dromedary\u2122 bags, reducing spillage and the risk of cross-contamination with unfiltered water. The over-pressure relief valve vents water back down the intake hose, so you don\u2019t get soaked with untreated water. A gauge is supplied so you can determine when it\u2019s time to replace the ceramic filter element.</p><ul><li>Filters at 1L per minute flow rate using AirSpring\u2122 air bubble technology</li><li>Effective against protozoa, and 0.2 micron or larger bacteria</li><li>Reduces concentrations of some chemicals (including iodine and chlorine)</li><li>Reduces odours and tastes</li><li>Foam pre-filter included</li></ul>",
