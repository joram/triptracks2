This heavier-weight top is a wonderful base layer in very cold weather, or as a cozy standalone option in cool to cold conditions. Ideal for ski touring, mountaineering and backpacking trips, or for high-output snowshoeing and nordic skiing, the 1/2 Zip Hoody keeps you toasty without overheating.</p><ul><li>Made of interlock knit merino wool, a fibre that wicks fast to keep you dry and is naturally antimicrobial</li><li>Flatlock seams eliminate chafing</li><li>Relaxed-fit hood adds extra warmth for your head and neck</li><li>Shoulder panels move top shoulder seams for comfort with a pack</li><li>Long centre front zip lets you open up for venting or zip up tight to keep out the chill</li></ul>",
