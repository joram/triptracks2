  "description": "<p>Soft for the steeps with support for the slabs, this aggressive and sensitive shoe is purpose built for hard routes and boulders. With a little more support than the well-loved Drago, the Chimera lets you grab small foot holds with your toes while providing confidence in less steep terrain. The asymmetrical lacing system can be cranked down on narrower feet or when you need a locked-in fit, and the PAF heel relieves pressure on the achilles while maintaining an aggressive fit.</p><ul><li>Microsuede upper with leather footbed for a consistent fit over time</li><li>Alcantara fibres in the toe area mould to your foot</li><li>PCB (Power Connection Band) strap provides a \"sucked in\" fit at the arch</li><li>SRT rubber-wrapped forefoot transfers power and provides grip for technical toe hooks and scumming</li><li>TPS midsole insert provides support without losing sensitivity</li><li>PAF heel system distributes the pressure on the heel for a comfortable fit</li><li>Vibram\u00ae XS Grip 2 rubber provides exceptional friction and sensitivity</li><li>Members typically downsize 1-1.5 sizes (performance fit) or 0.5-1 sizes (comfort fit) from their street shoe size</li></ul>",
