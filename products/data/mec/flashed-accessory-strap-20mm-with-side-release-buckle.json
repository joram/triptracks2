  "description": "<p>Place your chalk bag right where you want it with this lightweight belt. Sure, you could clip your chalk bag to your harness, but that can be dangly, unruly, and just plain awkward to get to when you need it most. This lightweight webbing belt let you easily swap your chalk from side to side, and keeps your chalk close to your body, a nice feature when climbing steep routes.</p><ul><li>20mm nylon webbing is strong, durable, and dries quickly</li></ul>",
