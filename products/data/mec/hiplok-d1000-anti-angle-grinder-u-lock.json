  "description": "<p>Your bike means a lot to you, it\u2019s also worth a lot to crooks, so protect it. Angle grinders are the #1 choice of lock-defeating tools, so Hiplok set out to design a lock that could defeat an angle grinder. The key to the D1000\u2019s ultimate level of protection lies in its hardened graphene steel composite. This composite material takes 20 times longer to cut through with an angle grinder than conventional hardened steel. Every aspect of this lock\u2019s construction has been optimized to protect your property, from its square shackle, to its compact lock opening. Whether you\u2019re protecting a pedal bike, an e-bike, or a motorbike, the D1000 is some of the best protection you can buy.</p><ul><li>Rated Diamond level protection (that\u2019s the best) by Sold Secure \u2013 an independent 3rd party lock testing group. This means it can withstand more than 90 seconds of an attack by an angle grinder, and if you look at the videos, it lasts a lot longer than that</li><li>20mm graphene reinforced premium hardened steel shackle is incredibly strong and destroys cutting discs</li><li>15.5 x 9.2cm opening leaves room for you bike and what you\u2019re locking it to, with no room leftover for leverage tools</li><li>Silicone sleeve on the shackle protects your bike\u2019s paint</li><li>3 coded keys are included</li></ul>",
