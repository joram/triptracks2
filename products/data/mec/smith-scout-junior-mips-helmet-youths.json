With a tough ABS outer, the Scout Junior can handle life on 2 wheels, skis or a board. MIPS (Multi-directional Impact Protection System) technology reduces the rotating forces on your head on the event of a crash, giving you peace of mind during strategic risk-taking on the hill. An easy elastic fit system, loads of vents and removeable earpads ensure this helmet stays in use all year long.</p><ul><li>ABS hardshell construction balances protection and strength with durability</li><li>EPS inner absorbs and dissipates energy from side impacts and collisions</li><li>Venting keeps airflow moving to control the climate inside</li><li>MIPS helps with the reduction of rotational forces in the event of a crash</li><li>Elastic fit system self-adjusts for each use</li><li>Removable ear pads make spring days less sweaty</li><li>Side release buckle for glove-friendly on/off</li></ul>",
