  "description": "<p>A Ropeman makes a great alternative to prusiks or heavier ascenders. It is essentially an incomplete ascender until you add a locking carabiner to it. The carabiner acts as the spine against which the cam presses the rope. The version has forged side plates and an aluminum cam, making it the lightest of all the Ropemen.</p><ul><li>Aluminum cam, aluminum side plates</li><li>Forged side plates work with a wide range of carabiner types and shapes</li><li>Works with ropes from 10 to 13mm</li><li>4kN strength</li><li>CE certified</li></ul>",
