  "description": "<p>Good pedals should help you put the power down in the climbs, help you bring the bike with you in the air, and help you feel planted when you drop-in, OneUp\u2019s pedals do all those things. Made from light and strong T6 aluminum and available in plenty of colours, these pedals are at home on your dirt jumper, your trail bike, or your enduro sled. Equipped with 10 grub pins per side you feel connected to your bike, but not so connected that you can\u2019t ditch when that skinny doesn\u2019t work out.</p><ul><li>Large 115 x 105mm platform works well for shoes of all sizes</li><li>Rear loading hexagonal grub pins bite into your shoes and are easier to change than front loading pins</li><li>Slight convex profile encourages your foot to wrap around the surface of the pedal, making it easier to scoop the bike up with you in a bunny hop</li><li>Thin leading edge (8mm) gives you more clearance and less pedal strikes</li><li>Fully sealed design is easily serviceable and has a built-in bearing extractor</li><li>Pin to axle distance: 112mm</li></ul>",
