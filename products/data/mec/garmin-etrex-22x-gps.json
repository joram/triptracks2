  "description": "<p>Instead of reinventing the wheel, Garmin decided to improve it. The latest generation of the venerable eTrex line adds routable TopoActive maps, loaded with streets and trails. Now, you can use your eTrex 22x to get turn-by-turn directions, no add-ons or downloads required. Not sure where to stop for lunch, or looking for something to do, the TopoActive maps can help. Loaded with points of interest, you can scroll through nearby restaurants, attractions and more. Features like the rugged water-resistant housing and bright colour display have also made the jump to the 22x. Equipped with a high-sensitivity receiver that accesses both GPS and GLONASS satellites, giving you a fast and accurate signal nearly anywhere. Staying true to the eTrex name, this new line stays compact, rugged, easy to use and ready for adventure.</p><ul><li>Preloaded with road-routable TopoActive maps (Canada and US 100K resolution), featuring streets and trails, making front-country or backcountry navigation a lot easier</li><li>Point of interest navigation lets you search for places you may want to go, e.g restaurants, attractions, accommodation, etc</li><li>Paperless geocaching compatible, download GPX files from your favourite geocaching site right to your device</li><li>Integrated antenna for outstanding signal reception from GPS and GLONASS satellites</li><li>ANT+ compatibile opens up the ability to use many fitness sensors, like heart rate belts</li><li>2.2 in. colour screen is bright and clear, making it easy to read in all conditions, even direct sun</li><li>8GB of internal memory can be increased via MicroSD cards (not included), giving you lots of room to add maps</li><li>IPX7 waterproofing protects your GPS from even the heaviest downpours</li><li>Intuitive button interface doesn\u2019t get confused by weather or gloves, unlike some touchscreens</li><li>Runs off 2 AAs that provide up to 25 hours of battery life.
