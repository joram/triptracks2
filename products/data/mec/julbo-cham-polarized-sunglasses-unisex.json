  "description": "<p>Looking like they just stepped off the pages of an early \u201890s National Geographic magazine, these sunnies bring a little glacial cool to your everyday life. With features you'd expect to find in a pair of glacier glasses, but lenses that are light enough to use every day, the Cham offer a great balance of coverage and real-world usability.</p><ul><li>Removable side-shields protect your eyes from all angles</li><li>Rubber grips on the temples and nose bridge reduce slippage</li><li>Long adjustable temples help to keep the glasses locked on your head</li><li>Polarized lenses cut through reflections, great for use around water, snow, pavement and anywhere else glare lies in wait</li><li>Flash lens coatings increase contrast</li><li>Category 3 lenses offering great versatility and protection, they are intended for everyday activities but would be too bright for glacier use</li><li>6-base ARC lens curve minimizes distortion</li></ul>",
