  "description": "<p>A true game changer that makes almost any questionable water source safe to drink.  This purifier means you don't need to carry chemical water treatment, or a UV purifier when you are in virus territory. It  removes viruses, bacteria, and protozoa.  And it back-flushes itself during normal operation, so it's a lightweight and convenient package for travel and expeditions.</p><ul><li>Filters 2.5L per minute at 60-80 strokes per minute</li><li>Hollow fiber filter removing bacteria and protozoa</li><li>On every stroke, 10% of the water flushes contaminants from the filter back into the source, so no back-flushing or scrubbing cartridges</li><li>Withstands freezing</li><li>Drop tested from 6 feet to concrete, as conducted by the MSR lab</li><li>Includes storage bag and manual</li><li>Note: the quality of water will significantly affect the filter's life</li></ul>",
