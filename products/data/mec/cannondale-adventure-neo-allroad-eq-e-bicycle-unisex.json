  "description": "<p>Cannondale\u2019s relaxed go-anywhere cruiser gets an electronic upgrade. Outfitted with a powerful hub-mounted motor the Adventure Neo makes going to that out of the way bakery or taking the long way home, easier than ever. With both a pedal assist and a thumb throttle, it is easy to add a little extra oomph, or dial it back. While the bar mounted display lets you know how your battery is doing, how fast you are going and more. Big smooth rolling Kenda tires have great grip on bike lanes and backroads. Integrated rack and fender mounts let you customize your new ride for any weather or job. And the kickstand helps your e-bike stand tall when there are no racks in sight.</p><ul><li>SmartForm C3 alloy frame and chromoly fork, with relaxed geometry</li><li>Bafang G020 250W drive unit mounted in the rear hub has multiple levels of adjustable throttle</li><li>Pedal assist puts more power behind every stroke, while the thumb throttle lets you add assist even when you aren\u2019t pedaling</li><li>Max distance varies with conditions and assistance level; Cannondale quotes a maximum range of 75km</li><li>Bar mounted display makes it easy to turn your bike (and your lights) on and off, select the right level of assistance, and check on the battery</li><li>Removable battery is easy to take with you, bring inside for charging, or even swap out.
