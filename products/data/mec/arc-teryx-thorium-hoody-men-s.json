Also, a bio-derived liner reduces reliance on petroleum-based materials. It boasts a generous filling of 750 fill-power down, ensuring remarkable thermal efficiency while keeping weight in check. It utilizes Down Composite Mapping\u2122 technology, with Coreloft\u2122 synthetic insulation in moisture-prone areas.
