  "description": "<p>The latest 9-series Forerunner is easier to use than ever, so you get to spend more time doing what you love and less time pushing buttons. Borrowing a couple features from Garmin's f\u0113nix line, the Forerunner 955 gets a touchscreen and an efficient solar panel that might just make charging a thing of the past. The touchscreen makes scrolling and zooming through the pre-loaded maps, or any course you create, feel natural. With more satellites to choose from, the 955\u2019s powerful GPS pulls in speed, distance, and location data. While other sensors pay attention to where you train, not just how you train, factoring elevation and temperature into your performance. The new training readiness feature helps make the most of your training, guiding you away from overtraining or under training, so you reach your fitness goals faster than ever. Each morning the 955 delivers your morning report, summarizing sleep quality, recovery level, training effects, and even provides a personalized daily workout suggestion. When you need more information, or motivation, you can download training plans through the free Garmin Connect app. Garmin Connect lets you review activities, receive texts and other notifications, keep an eye on the weather and more. Through the connection to your phone the 955 can connect to multiple music services and can even hold up to 1000 songs. With music and mapping right on your wrist, phone-free runs are looking better and better.</p><ul><li>Power Glass\u2122 solar panel lets you go longer between charges, from 30 hours to 5 days longer \u2013 runtime is feature dependent</li><li>Sun gauge displays solar charge status</li><li>Built-in modes for biking, running, swimming (indoor and outdoor), multisport \u2013 transition between activities within a single workout at the press of a button, gym focused activities (strength training \u2013 with rep counter, cardio and elliptical training, stair stepping, indoor rowing and yoga) and more</li><li>Includes North American map data with room to add more maps</li><li>Point of interest navigation lets you search for places you may want to go, e.g restaurants, attractions, accommodation, etc</li><li>Round-trip mapping: enter a distance and the 955 will use tracks from other Garmin users to calculate multiple course options that start and stop right were you are</li><li>Trendline\u2122 routing uses Garmin Connect\u2019s database of routes and finds the most popular way to get you where you are going</li><li>Stream music through a paired smartphone using Spotify, iHeartRadio, Pandora or Deezer.
