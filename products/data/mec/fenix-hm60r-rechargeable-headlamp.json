  "description": "<p>Speed up and your light gets brighter, dial it back and so does your headlamp. Designed with trail running in mind, the MH60R has intelligent lighting modes that detect your step frequency, the faster you run (more steps), the brighter the light gets. When you\u2019re pushing your pace, the light uses both spot and flood lighting, letting you see what is right in front of you and what is further down the trail. Both spot and flood lighting are accessible in the HM60R\u2019s standard modes and can be used together, or independently. The 3 red light modes are great for early starts and answering the call of nature without waking your tent mates. Compatibility with a single rechargeable 18650 (included) or 2 CR123A batteries gives you options on the grid, or off.</p><ul><li>9 modes, 4 white spot: 30 lumens (54h), 130 lumens (18h), 350 lumens (8h), 1300 lumens turbo (2h \u2013 only useable for 3 minutes at a time due to heat buildup), 4 white flood: 5 lumen (300h), 70 lumens (24h), 350 lumens (8h), 5 lumen SOS (200h), and red flood 5 lumen (100h)</li><li>Step frequency sensing mode increases brightness the faster you run</li><li>Spot and flood lighting give lighting options for up close or far away</li><li>Onboard USB-C charging port means you no longer need to remove the battery to charge your light (you can still remove the battery)</li><li>Works with 1 rechargeable 18650 battery or 2 CR123A batteries, giving you convenient power options when travelling or stocking your emergency kit</li><li>Rugged aluminum body has type-III hard anodizing for an extra level of protection</li><li>Glass lens is toughened for durability and has anti-reflective coating</li><li>LED power indicator lets you know how your battery is doing, whether charging or discharging</li><li>1-button operation is easy to use, with or without gloves</li><li>Intelligent circuitry remembers the last mode you were in</li><li>Lockout mode keeps your light from coming on when you don\u2019t want it on</li><li>180\u00b0 tilt makes it easy to aim your light where you need it</li><li>Silicone strip on the back of the head strap helps keep it in place</li><li>Perforated, reflective headband wicks away sweat and helps keep you seen</li><li>Regulated output maintains constant brightness throughout battery life</li><li>In the box: HM60R, ARB-L18 3400mAh 18650 battery, USB-C charging cable, spare O-ring, user manual and warranty card</li></ul>",
