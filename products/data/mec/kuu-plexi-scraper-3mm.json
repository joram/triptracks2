  "description": "<p>A plexi scraper for removing excess wax from ski bases after hot waxing. They're safe to use, and skiers with an over-abundance of waxing enthusiasm are less likely to damage their bases with this tool. It will require fairly frequent sharpening (with a steel sharpener) for best results. Thickness is 3mm.</p>",
