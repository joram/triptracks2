  "description": "<p>The long shaft and flared cheeks of this axe puts more power behind every swing. Equipped with flares behind the cutting edge, the X11 bites deep into wood, making short work of camp chores, splitting, and chopping. The hollow handle is light enough to bring in a pack or on a canoe trip. The plastic edge cover secures with a rotating clip and makes a great handle, lash point, or way to hang the hatchet when not in use.</p><ul><li>Flared cheeks increase mechanical advantage, making splitting large rounds easier than with a standard axe</li><li>Tempered and forged steel holds an edge for a long time</li><li>Fibreglass-reinforced polymer shaft is moulded around the head</li><li>Edge cover and carry handle included</li></ul>",
