  "description": "<p>Triple-certified as a single, half and twin rope, the Aero is substantial enough for cragging or mixed and ice climbing, but kept skinny and light for hard redpoint attempts or moving quickly in big mountain terrain. The XEROS dry technology is applied when the nylon is still a filament, treating the entire rope from core to sheath, and resulting in less waste and energy use than traditional treatments.</p><ul><li>XEROS permanent dry treatment is applied to nylon filaments before they're twisted into yarns. This results in less water absorption through the entire rope and prevents freezing in cold environments</li><li>Made with PFOA-free, PFAS-free, and bluesign\u00ae certified raw materials</li><li>High sheath proportion adds durability</li><li>Middle mark increases safety and speed on rappels</li><li>Specs shown are for use as a single rope</li><li>When used as a half rope, the specs are as follows (based on tests with 2 strands): Dynamic elongation: 28.9% Static elongation: 6.6% Impact force: 8.6kN UIAA fall rating: 21</li><li>When used as a twin rope, the specs are as follows (based on tests with 2 strands): Dynamic elongation: 23.6% Static elongation: 6.1% Impact force: 10.1kN UIAA fall rating: more than 20</li></ul>",
