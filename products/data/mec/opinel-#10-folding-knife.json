  "description": "<p>For all round camp use, whittling, and food prep, this traditional folding pocket knife is a proven performer. Its tempered carbon steel blade holds a keen edge. While a thumbnail slot can be used to open the blade, the \u201cSavoyard knack\u201d (a sharp tap of the handle end on a hard flat surface) will easily open it too. A slotted stainless steel clip securely locks the blade open or closed. The contoured hardwood handle feels comfortable in your hand.</p><ul><li>Note: the carbon content will lead to corrosion if the blade is not occasionally oiled and sharpened</li></ul>",
