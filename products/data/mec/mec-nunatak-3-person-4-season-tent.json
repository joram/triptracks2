  "description": "<p>A burly expedition shelter for places where Mother Nature really throws it down. If Denali or Mount Logan is in your plans, the MEC Nunatak has been wind-tunnel and snow-load tested to simulate the high-elevation storms and exposed glacier settings you'll encounter. The dome structure offers a reasonable amount of headroom and living space, without compromising its wind-shedding ability or making it a beast that's too heavy to pack. Guy out points with pre-attached lines, plus large loops to fit skis let you pin it down during storms. With a snow skirt and room for both occupants to put on their boots, the front vestibule extends the practical space. A rear vestibule adds gear storage and gives you a back hatch to exit from during the night.</p><ul><li>Fly is lightweight, durable 40-denier polyester ripstop with an ether-type polyurethane waterproof coating</li><li>Floor is durable 70-denier nylon with a heavy-duty ether-type polyurethane waterproof coating</li><li>DriBase\u2122 waterproof floor offers durable water protection throughout the lifetime of the tent</li><li>High-strength DAC Pressfit aluminum poles with green anodizing</li><li>4-pole dome structure provides headroom, snow shedding capacity and stability in wind in any direction</li><li>Large, side-entry front vestibule with hooped pole.
