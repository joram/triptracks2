  "description": "<p>Free-climbing technical shoes for cracks, big-walls and Yosemite-scale outings. Tommy Caldwell and Alex Honnold got together to improve this big-wall classic, with a new single piece rand for added durability and thinner webbing in the lacing harness for more comfort while jamming. The mid-height cut protects your ankles and strategically placed foam helps make long splitters endurable if not comfortable.</p><ul><li>Eco leather upper provides protection and durability when jamming</li><li>Updated single-piece rand is less likely to delaminate</li><li>Padded airmesh tongues for comfort and breathability</li><li>P3 tensioning system directs power over the toes and forefoot</li><li>1.1mm Laspoflex midsole for stiffness and power when edging</li><li>Vibram\u00ae XS Edge\u2122 rubber outsole performs well on small edges</li><li>La Sportiva suggests downsizing 1-1.5 sizes (performance fit) or 0.5-1 sizes (comfort fit) from your street shoe size</li></ul>",
