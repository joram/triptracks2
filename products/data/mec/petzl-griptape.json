Great for replacing chewed up rubber or worn out tape.</p><ul><li>To apply, wrap the tape around the shaft stretching it as you go. The tape will adhere as it contracts, although it's not sticky like conventional tape</li><li>Dimensions are 19mm width x 1m length. Enough for a single tool</li><li>Same tape as the stuff used on Petzl\u00ae Nomic tools</li></ul>",
