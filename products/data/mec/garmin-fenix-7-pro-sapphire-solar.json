  "description": "<p>Go for a backpacking trip, run an ultra, or do a couple triathlons, all on a single charge. Equipped with Garmin\u2019s efficient Power Glass, the f\u0113nix 7 Pro uses the power of the sun to make regular charging a thing of the past. When using the muti-band GPS, Garmin\u2019s SatIQ technology optimizes power usage. SatIQ matches your GPS signal to your environment; flat land gets a low power signal, head into the mountains and the signal is automatically boosted. Free downloadable shaded relief maps help you plan your next trip, and when connected to your phone, can even display live satellite weather. When it comes to navigating your fitness, 24/7 heartrate tracking and other metrics combine to give you a complete picture of how you train, how you recover and how you live. If you need extra information, or motivation, you can download training plans through Garmin\u2019s free Connect app. Connect lets you stream music, receive notifications, track the weather and more.
