  "description": "<p>Sensitive shoes for dancing up steep sport routes and working moves on your training wall. They have good rubber coverage that lends itself to involved footwork and tricky hooking tactics. A bi-tensioned randing system keeps weight centered over the toe, but doesn't cram your foot forward.</p><ul><li>Durable microsuede and leather uppers</li><li>Rubber toe patch provides toe-scumming and hooking power</li><li>Slightly asymmetric, curved shape for precise foot placement</li><li>Vibram XS Edge rubber is designed to grip through friction moves</li><li>Members typically downsize 1-1.5 sizes (performance fit) or 0.5-1 sizes (comfort fit) from their street shoe size</li></ul>",
