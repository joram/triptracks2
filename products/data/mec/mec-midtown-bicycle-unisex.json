  "description": "<p>Our entry-level urban bike is made for commuting and travelling swiftly around town. This model gets a big upgrade to hydraulic disc brakes. If you're used to rim brakes, you'll feel the difference in stopping power immediately, and you'll really appreciate their performance on rainy days. With quality components, the Midtown is easy to maintain, and it's a reliable ride for getting from point A to point B. Outfit it with a rack and panniers and it will get you smoothly from point C to D as well. It's large-diameter wheels roll with more momentum than standard 26in. mountain bike wheels, and can handle bumps, dug-up pavement and unpaved side streets.</p><ul><li>Lightweight aluminum frame uses butted tubing to keep it light</li><li>700 x 35mm tires are built for paved or dirt roads, paths and light trail use</li><li>Shimano\u00ae hydraulic disc brakes are powerful in all weather conditions</li><li>Wide-range gearing suits general city riding</li><li>Upright seated position and riser bars give you good visibility in traffic</li><li>Flat MEC Moss pedals are easy to use</li><li>Bikes are covered by MEC's Rocksolid Guarantee and Bike Service Agreement.
