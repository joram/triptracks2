  "description": "<p>Just one more run? Pleeeaaase? With waterproof, insulated fabric and a fleece-lined waistband, the Snowbelle Pants stay comfortable from the time the grooming machines go out 'til the chairlifts stop. Waterproof-breathable fabric bends and turns with you down the run, keeping you dry thanks to taped seams and a DWR finish. The insulation is light, so you stay warm, not weighed down. Nylon patches keep ski edges from scuffing inner legs and hems, and knees are articulated to help prevent blowouts. And the waterproof zipper on the thigh pocket means the driving snow coming at you on the chair won't get in.</p><ul><li>Waterproof-breathable construction with taped seams and DWR treatment</li><li>Herringbone polyester shell is soft and supple</li><li>Lightweight insulation is 92% recycled polyester</li><li>Adjustable waistband is contoured and fleece-lined</li><li>Articulated knees</li><li>Durable nylon patches protect hem and inner legs</li><li>Internal gaiters with grippy elastic keep snow out</li><li>Zippered fly with double snap closure</li><li>Handwarmer pockets with covered zip closure</li><li>Secure pocket on upper thigh with waterproof zipper</li></ul>",
