  "description": "<p>Finned 2-piston pads for your gravel grinds and road-based adventures. Updated with a new resin compound, these pads last up to 50% longer than the previous generation. Compared to metal pads, the resin compound is quiet, generates less heat, and offers more progressive stopping power (no sudden braking). The only compromise? Resin has a shorter lifespan than metal, especially under wet conditions.</p><ul><li>Finned Ice Technologies pulls heat away from the pads, reducing brake fade</li><li>3rd generation resin compound lasts 90% longer than 1st generation and 50% longer than 2nd generation</li><li>To replace both front and rear brakes, you will require 2 sets of these brake pads</li><li>Interchangeable with K-type finless pads</li><li>Fits all Shimano flat mount gravel & road disc calipers, including Dura Ace BR-R9170, Ultegra BR-R8070, 105 BR-R7070, GRX BR-RX810 and BR-RX400</li><li>Not compatible with XTR BR-M9100</li></ul>",
