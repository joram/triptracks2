  "description": "<p>These pink birds make a statement on the big mountain and in the lift line. Progressive in the tail allows for easy turn initiation while classic camber underfoot adds to stability and edge hold. Semi-cap construction combines the durability of a sidewall ski with the ability to transfer power of a cap constructed ski. From carving hardpack to straight lining through fresh powder, these freeride beasts are forgiving and easy to navigate over any terrain.</p><ul><li>Lightweight Poplar wood core feels light underfoot but still has good shock absorption and stability</li><li>Slightly contoured side cut for stability when carving</li><li>Front rocker and classic long camber underfoot</li><li>Titanal mounting plate sets a solid base to better accommodate hybrid bindings</li><li>Semi cap sidewall construction with carbon fiber and mixed glass laminate for torsion and flex control</li><li>Sintered graphite base is fast and very durable</li></ul>",
