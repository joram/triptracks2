Tektro Orion brakes give you a 4-piston caliper up front in a 2-piston caliper out back, so you can keep your velocity exactly where you want it. And, dialed in geometry delivers a natural riding position that feels great in the climbs, and is confidence inspiring in the descents.</p><ul><li>RockShox Recon RL front fork has motion control damping allowing low-speed compression adjustment and lockout</li><li>RockShox Deluxe Select+ rear shock has been custom tuned to match the Siskiu T7\u2019s geometry and Polygon\u2019s Faux Bar linkage.
