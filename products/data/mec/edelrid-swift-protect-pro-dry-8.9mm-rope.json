  "description": "<p>Looking for low weight and high durability? The Swift Protect ticks both those boxes. One of the skinniest around, it meets testing standards to certify it as a single, half, or twin rope and weighs in at a scant 53g/m. The sheath has aramid fibres braided into it, a material commonly found in ballistic armour, resulting in extremly high resistance to abrasion and cutting - a first of its kind in dynamic ropes. The combination of lightness and durability are great for projecting and hard redpoints on rock, ice, or in the alpine.</p><ul><li>Protect sheath with aramid and polyamide fibres is highly cut-resistant</li><li>Thermo Shield treatment gives it excellent handling properties, a supple feel and an impressive strength rating</li><li>Pro Dry finish makes this rope durably water repellent and dirt resistant</li><li>3D lap coiled so you can use it straight away without kinking or tangling</li><li>Meets UIAA standard water-repellent test, meaning this rope is fast-drying, absorbs virtually no water and resists freezing</li><li>Specs shown are for use as a single rope</li><li>When used as a half rope, the specs are as follows:\nDynamic elongation: 26%\nStatic elongation: 5.2%\nImpact force: 7.3kN\nUIAA fall rating: 18</li><li>When used as a twin rope, the specs are as follows (based on tests with 2 strands):\nDynamic elongation: 25%\nStatic elongation: 3.5%\nImpact force: 11.8kN\nUIAA fall rating: 30</li></ul>",
