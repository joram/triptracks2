A German-engineered attachment system holds it solidly on your rack, and releases with a simple button push. The big U-zipper makes packing and unpacking a breeze and the rain cover ensures dark clouds won\u2019t cause you any worry. Based on member feedback, we've tweaked this version of our popular World Tour Pannier to reconfigure the pockets, add more reflectivity and use a lighter yet still durable fabric.</p><ul><li>Made of lightweight yet durable 300-denier high-tenacity polyester with a PU coating and a DWR finish for excellent water resistance</li><li>Rixen and Kaul Modul attachment system has spring-loaded top hooks that automatically adjust to fit rails from 8 to 16mm diameter.
