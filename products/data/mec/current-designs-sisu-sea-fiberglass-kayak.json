  "description": "<p>Designed to accommodate progressing skill levels, the Sisu is slightly shorter and wider than its predecessor the Prana. The hard chine offers stability in waves, but the shape is also efficient to paddle. A skeg helps keep you in line and offers more stability, and the shallow v hull has a lively feel and improves tracking.</p><ul><li>Lightweight and durable vacuum-bagged fiberglass construction</li><li>Thigh braces provide comfortable, secure contact with the deck underside for greater energy transfer</li><li>Waterproof sealed bulkheads for easy storage and hull rigidity</li><li>Shallow v shape improves tracking and stability</li><li>Skeg can be dropped from the cockpit by releasing the locking mechanism</li><li>Drop-down skeg lets you select easy turning or hard tracking, as the sea and wind require</li><li>Bungee cords on the deck help keep your essentials handy</li><li>Front and rear grab handle aids carrying</li></ul>",
