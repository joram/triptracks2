  "description": "<p>Everything you need to enter the world of cruisy bike lanes, urban excursions, and living the good life on two wheels. At the heart of the Chinook lies a solid aluminum frame that blends comfortable geometry with a responsive ride. Wide yet smooth 35mm tires roll fast, but won't feel sketchy on gravel or dirt roads. On damp days or wintry commutes, you'll appreciate the consistent braking power that comes with disc brakes. We've opted for a selection of Shimano\u00ae components and a wide range of gears to keep shifting smooth whether you're churning up hills or cruising country roads.</p><ul><li>Durable 6061-series aluminum frame with butted tubes reduces overall weight</li><li>700 x 35mm Kenda Trekking tires roll fast yet are durable enough for dirt roads and light trail use</li><li>Tektro Novela disc brakes provide good stopping power regardless of weather</li><li>Wide gearing suits everything from steep hills to fun descents</li><li>Upright seated position and riser bars provide plenty of comfort</li><li>Flat MEC Moss pedals are easy to use</li><li>Ergonomic saddle provides plenty of support and comfort</li><li>Bikes are covered by MEC's Rocksolid Guarantee and Bike Service Agreement.
