We\u2019ve designed it to be paired with the Fusion Shorts or Capris for core insulation in warm water and warm weather, or with the Fusion Pants as a convenient alternative to a full Farmer John in cooler conditions.</p><p>The Fusion series combines years of material development with exceptionally sophisticated patterning to produce neoprene that\u2019s comfortable to wear while you're active, and warmer in the water if you swim.</p><ul><li>2mm, four-way super-stretch neoprene for maximum comfort and fit</li><li>Long in the back for good coverage when seated in a kayak or canoe</li></ul>",
