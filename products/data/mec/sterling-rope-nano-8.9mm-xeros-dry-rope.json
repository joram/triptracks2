  "description": "<p>A triple threat line that's dry treated and certified as a single, half and twin. For sporty routes and hard redpoints, it's now leaner, meaner and dryer than before. The XEROS dry technology is applied when the nylon is still a filament, treating the entire rope from core to sheath, and resulting in less waste and energy use than traditional treatments.</p><ul><li>XEROS permanent dry treatment is applied to nylon filaments before they're twisted into yarns. This results in less water absorption through the entire rope and prevents freezing in cold environments</li><li>Made with bluesign\u00ae certified raw materials</li><li>High sheath proportion adds durability</li><li>Middle mark increases safety and speed on rappels</li><li>Specs shown are for use as a single rope</li><li>When used as a half rope, the specs are as follows (based on tests with 2 strands): Dynamic elongation: 27.6% Static elongation: 7% Impact force: 6.6kN UIAA fall rating: 16</li><li>When used as a twin rope, the specs are as follows (based on tests with 2 strands): Dynamic elongation: 25.3% Static elongation: 3.6% Impact force: 10.4kN UIAA fall rating: more than 20</li></ul>",
