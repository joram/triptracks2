  "description": "<p>This pump-free system is gravity fed and offers a high-flow capacity. Fill the unfiltered water reservoir, raise, and hang it. You'll have 4L of clean water in under 3 minutes.</p><p>The fibres in this filter are slightly more brittle than other types. Although the cartridge is encased in a protective rubber shell, and drop-tested to seven feet, consider carrying a spare cartridge on long trips \u2013 they are small, light, and relatively inexpensive.</p><ul><li>Filters 4L of water in less than 3 minutes (depends on water quality)</li><li>Hollow fibre filter has a high surface-area that allows water to flow quickly through a 0.2 micron effective pore size</li><li>Do not allow the cartridge to freeze after initial use</li><li>Nominal 1500L filter life is for clear water, turbidity will reduce the useful life of any filter</li><li>Maintain a high flow rate in the field by holding the clean water reservoir above the unfiltered reservoir. No disassembly required</li><li>Unfiltered reservoir has a webbing handle for carrying and hanging. Quick-disconnect valve automatically cuts the flow of water when the hose is disconnected. Hose connection on the side won't collect silt and debris</li><li>Clean reservoir has a webbing loop and a simple hose connection, and no top zipper, so it won't pop open while in use</li><li>Reservoirs are made of silver ion-treated polyethylene film that doesn't pick up tastes</li><li>Clip-style shut-off valve on output hose between reservoirs</li><li>Silicone tubing</li></ul>",
