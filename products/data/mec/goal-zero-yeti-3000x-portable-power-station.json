  "description": "<p>Maybe \u201coff the grid\u201d isn\u2019t such a big deal. The Yeti 3000X gives you portable power \u2013 anywhere. Lightweight lithium batteries offer on-grid convenience without any of the fumes or noise of a generator. Wi-Fi integration lets you use the free Yeti app to check charge and discharge rates, turn ports on or off, monitor temperatures, update firmware and much more, from anywhere you have a signal. Or, if your phone isn't within reach, find the same information in the onboard digital display. With a full suite of charging ports, you can charge or run almost anything, from power tools out in the field, to an actual fridge in your camp kitchen.</p><ul><li>Upgraded 2000W AC (3500W surge) inverter can power even the most power-hungry household devices</li><li>Wi-Fi lets you control the Yeti 3000X remotely, so you can check charging and discharging status, update firmware, turn ports on or off, and much more</li><li>LCD power status display for power use, battery charge capacity and time remaining under current load</li><li>Charges via included wall charger, going from 0 to full in 14 hours, or 6-72 hours from a compatible solar panel (bigger and more efficient panels take less time)</li><li>MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracker) technology enables more efficient charging via solar panels in low-light conditions</li><li>Li-NMC (lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide) battery offers a longer life than standard lithium-ion batteries and better inherent safety, and they're lighter than lead-acid batteries</li><li>Battery can be kept plugged into a power source during storage, or fully charge your Yeti 3000X Lithium every 3-6 months and store in a cool, dry place</li><li>Included Yeti cart makes moving your power from A-to-B a whole lot easier</li><li>Peak capacity is 3032 Wh (10.8V, 280.8Ah) and lasts through hundreds of cycles</li><li>Smart management system provides charging (solar or mains) and low-battery protection built-in</li><li>4 USB ports (output): 2 x type-A at 5V, up to 2.4A (12W max), 2 x USB-C 1 at 5V, up to 3.0A (18W max), and 1 at USB-PD spec 5\u201320V up to 3.0A (60W max), all ports are regulated</li><li>6mm port (output): 12V, up to 13A (120W max)</li><li>12V car port (output): 12V, up to 13A (120W max)</li><li>12V power pole port (output): 12V, up to 30A (360W max)</li><li>AC inverter (output, 60Hz, pure sine wave): 120VAC 16.5A (2000W, 3500W surge)</li><li>Provides pass-through power, so you can plug your Yeti into the wall and then your device into your Yeti to make sure your device stays powered should the power go out</li><li>Charging port (input, 8mm):14-50V, up to 10A (150W max)</li><li>Power-pole charging port (input): 14-50V, up to 50A 600W max)</li><li>Expansion port in the storage compartment, for use ONLY with Goal Zero modules</li><li>Storage compartment keeps cables and adapters close and where you need them</li><li>Operating temp is 0-40\u00b0C</li><li>Includes a Goal Zero Yeti 3000X Lithium Power Station, Yeti Cart and a wall charger</li><li>Do not attempt to charge your yeti lithium from a 12v source with anything but the yeti 12v car charging cable (sold separately).
