Simply push on the contoured thumb pad and the machined aluminum lever rides on a sealed cartridge bearing, delivering glassy calm ups and downs. Yeah, it\u2019s that good.</p><ul><li>Tacky rubber thumb pad reduces slippage and wears well</li><li>Sealed cartridge bearings and additional seal around the pivot keep things smooth in all conditions</li><li>If you\u2019re running SRAM MatchMaker X and want to streamline your cockpit, this kit connects the Loam lever to the left side\u2019s brake clamp, meaning 1 less clamp on your bars</li><li>Compatible with all cable-actuated droppers</li><li>Designed for 1x drivetrains, so no shifters on the left</li></ul>",
