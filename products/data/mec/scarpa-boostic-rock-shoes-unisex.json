  "description": "<p>The secret weapon for climbing technical masterpieces. This micro-edging machine is slightly wider in the forefoot and narrower in the heel than it's predecessor. The PAF heel system reduces pressure on the Achilles without sacrificing a snug fit. The midsole curves slightly up the outside of your foot, providing support while staying thin and sensitive. A great option for routes demanding edging power and precision.</p><ul><li>Microsuede uppers with ceramic reinforcements in high wear areas</li><li>Alcantara fibres in the toe area mould to your foot</li><li>PAF heel system distributes pressure over the heel for a comfortable fit</li><li>Curved 1mm Flexan midsole provides support on small footholds</li><li>3.5mm XS Edge rubber outsole grips tiny edges</li><li>Members typically downsize 1-1.5 sizes (performance fit) or 0.5-1 sizes (comfort fit) from their street shoe size</li></ul>",
