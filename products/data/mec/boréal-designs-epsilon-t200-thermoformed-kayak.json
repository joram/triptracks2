Outfitted with multiple storage hatches and sealed bulkheads this touring boat has plenty of room for your gear. A fully padded, adjustable seat keeps you comfy on long paddles. And should a little water get in the cockpit, the seat is perforated and dries quickly, so you won\u2019t end up sitting in a puddle.
