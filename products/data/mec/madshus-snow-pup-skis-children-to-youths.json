  "description": "<p>Designed to make skiing fun and easy, so little kids take to the sport from the get-go. The short and wide shape helps them balance and builds confidence. A gentle sidecut gives them nice glide for a bigger woohoo factor too.</p><ul><li>Durable bindings secure with buckles and are designed to fit most winter boots</li><li>Waxless bases provide some grip on uphills, but try duct-taping a short (15-20cm) piece of climbing skin under the binding to enhance climbing and braking performance in hillier terrain</li><li>Recommended for kids up to 25kg</li></ul>",
