  "description": "<p>The soft hand and thin diameter of this rope makes it suited to onsight attempts, redpoints and superlight alpine tours. For extended top-roping sessions you may want to choose a thicker, workhorse rope.</p><ul><li>Dry treatment on both sheath and core protects against water and dirt</li><li>Coated yarns allow individual fibres to glide over each other, reducing internal friction and fully utilizing each yarn when loaded, for extra durability</li><li>Comes lap-coiled by the factory, so ready to climb</li><li>High sheath percentage increases durability</li></ul>",
