  "description": "<p>The key to this ice tool leash is the one-handed extraction method you use to free your wrist. The slip-knot wrist loop locks tight, but opens easily when required by hooking on the tools hammer or adze. No more grabbing the leash by the teeth. Maximum tightness can be pre-set.</p><ul><li>Buckle attachment avoids knot</li><li>Variable-width cradle webbing</li></ul>",
