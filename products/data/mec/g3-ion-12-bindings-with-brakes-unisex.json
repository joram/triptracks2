  "description": "<p>Dynamic design gives these intuitive freeride bindings some extra oomph. Charge the descent with power thanks to a forward pressure and wide mount. No need to ski with your toes locked out, sleek toe jaw dynamics squeeze your boot with high force and absorb significant energy. Step-in and brake features deliver real rip-and-ride performance in a seriously light package. Freeride performance provides more power and a consistent release. Only a single tool is needed for mounts and adjustments, and a tried and true, fully retractable brake works for even bigger freeride skis.</p><ul><li>High and wide fulcrum position for toe arms squeeze your boot tight and absorb more energy so you can power up easily</li><li>Forward pressure absorbs energy and vibrations at high speeds and on landings</li><li>Wide freeride mount transfers power to edges and enhances the rigidity of the binding for superior pull-out resistance</li><li>Snow clearing channel prevents snow buildup and avoids unwanted pre-releases</li><li>QuickFlick heel lifts are easy to grab with pole or hand for quick exits and uphill travel</li><li>Heel rotation turns in either direction to lock for touring with either hand; no \u201cwrong way\u201d to spin it</li><li>A single tool (Pozi Drive #3) is needed for all mounts and adjustments\u2013 no need for a heel spacer</li><li>Fully retractable and spring-loaded brake stops even big freeride skis</li><li>Heel anti-friction device ensures consistent release</li><li>22mm length adjustability</li></ul>",
