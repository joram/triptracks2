It can be summoned too on long routes, for those who are thinking bout crossing over to the dark side (cracks, muti-pitch trad) but still want to wear their comfy slippers.</p><ul><li>Uppers are 1.8mm suede for performance and fit</li><li>Padded mesh tongues for comfort</li><li>1.0mm Flexan midsole for control</li><li>Tensioned rand and midsole gives underfoot support and focuses power over the toes and forefoot as you weight the shoe</li><li>Vibram\u00ae XS Edge soles use harder rubber that let you weight tiny edges</li><li>Members typically downsize 1-1.5 sizes (performance fit) or 0.5-1 sizes (comfort fit) from their street shoe size</li></ul>",
