  "description": "<p>Arguably the best designed, highest performing three-season bag available. It truly pushes the boundaries of its conservative three-season rating. The wind blocking shell and premium quality 850+ fill-power down insulation can be called upon in colder and nastier conditions. Best of all, all this performance is packed into an airy 1.1kg package. The narrow mummy profile offers a close fit for maximum efficiency. With a 150cm shoulder girth, the bag heats quickly and is compact enough to to haul about on any adventure. The Apache also boasts a full 3-D down filled collar to seal in heat. The 13cm baffle spacing offers superior down control and minimizes cold spots. Continuous baffle construction allows you to adjust the fill according to your needs.</p><ul><li>Rated to -9\u00b0C</li><li>Shell, collar, and draft tube are Gore\u2122 WINDSTOPPER\u00ae 830 fabric, which is light and compressible</li><li>Lining made of a 20-denier plain weave nylon</li><li>Insulated with goose down</li><li>#5 YKK zipper</li><li>When ordering please specify left or right zip.
