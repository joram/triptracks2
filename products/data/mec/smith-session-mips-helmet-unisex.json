If you crash, MIPS technology will reduce the rotational force to your head, helping prevent brain injury more effectively than your average road helmet. Koroyd technology adds extra protection in strategic, zonal impact areas so you can focus on pushing your pace. 15-point ventilation keeps you cool when you're working hard, and other impressive features include a rotary dial adjustment, removable visor, ventilation to prevent glasses fog, and cooling liner pads to wick sweat.</p><ul><li>MIPS technology reduces rotational forces to the head in the event of a fall, lessening the potential damage to the brain</li><li>Zonal Koroyd panels provide consistent energy absorption to disperse impacts in the case of an accident</li><li>VaporFit rotary dial adjustment system lets you fine-tune the fit</li><li>AirEvac ventilation system pulls warm air from in front of your face to reduce fog build-up on glasses</li><li>15 vents provide breathability to keep your head cool</li><li>X-Static liner pads with reactive cooling treatment help to pull sweat away from your head</li></ul>",
