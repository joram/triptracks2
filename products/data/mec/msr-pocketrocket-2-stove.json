  "description": "<p>Just as speedy as the original PocketRocket, but now smaller and even lighter. If you're aiming to keep your pack weight and size to a minimum, this is your stove. It stows neatly in its own little carrying case and can be slipped inside your coffee mug (if you choose to carry one). The built-in Wind Clip windshield system protects the burner from being blown out by gusts. The burner control is a good size, so you can fine tune the flame even with cold hands or when wearing bulky gloves.</p><ul><li>Made of stainless steel, aluminum, and brass</li><li>Redesigned serrated pot supports to keep your cookware from slipping</li><li>One 227g canister lasts approximately 60 minutes at full output, depending on temperature and altitude. Boils approximately 16L of water</li><li>Uses MSR Isobutane canisters (available separately)</li></ul>",
