This fleece-lined jacket uses waterproof-breathable fabric to ensure dryness through wet and windy conditions. Warm enough for cool fall days (or west-coast winters), it's designed to fit easily over layers if the conditions call for extra insulation. The boys' jacket is cut straight through the body with minimal tailoring.</p><ul><li>Shell is abrasion-resistant 75-denier polyester with a polyurethane waterproof breathable coating and a DWR (durable water repellency) finish</li><li>Fully lined with soft polyester microfleece that adds a bit more warmth for cool days</li><li>Zippered hand pockets for thawing fingers</li><li>Storm flap over zipper keeps weather out</li><li>Elasticized cuffs seal out the cold and damp</li><li>Reflective details for low-light visibility</li></ul>",
