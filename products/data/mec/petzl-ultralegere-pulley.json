  "description": "<p>The Ultra Lite is actually only a pulley sheave, so you'll need an oval carabiner to create the axle upon which it operates. It's a great minimalist design for mountaineers or climbers hauling small packs. However, it is not for use on Tyrolean traverses or organized rescue.</p><ul><li>Requires a round stock, oval locking carabiner</li><li>Breaking strength of 16kN, working load of 1kN</li><li>For ropes up to 13mm</li><li>For personal emergency use only</li></ul>",
