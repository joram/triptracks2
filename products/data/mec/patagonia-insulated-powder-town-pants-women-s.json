Inside, a soft taffeta lining manages moisture and glides smoothly over underlayers. External thigh vents let you regulate your climate. Articulated knees and a gusseted crotch provide unlimited mobility for big air shows.</p><ul><li>Durable 2-layer polyester H2No\u00ae breathable membrane with a DWR finish to keep you dry</li><li>Insulated with Thermogreen\u00ae recycled polyester, tailored thicknesses promote easy movement</li><li>Waist has a brushed lining to wick moisture, and adjustable elastic tabs to customize the fit. 2-snap closure and zip fly</li><li>Loops on rear yoke attach pant to powder skirt on any Patagonia\u00ae Snow jacket to keep snow out</li><li>Slim, watertight coated zippers for reduced bulk and weight</li><li>Gusseted crotch and articulated knees improve mobility and reduce bulk</li><li>External thigh vents quickly release heat</li><li>Gaiters keep the snow out, while tough scuff guards protect the inside of the leg and bottom hem</li><li>Built-in Recco\u00ae Rescue System reflector allows ski patrol and mountain rescue teams to detect and locate Recco reflectors under snow.
