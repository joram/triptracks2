  "description": "<p>The Ace is a \"real-deal\" mountain bike for kids from about 8 to 11. It uses a time-tested frame, burly enough for singletrack riding and for taking wee hits and drops. The hydraulic brakes offer control, so kids can learn to confidently feather the brakes as needed, and the brakes can be adjusted so they're right for your kid's reach and hand size. Wide bars, knobby tires, tuneable suspension and a 1x8 drivetrain make it a fully capable bike that's up for north-shore-style trails and full-on downhill ripping.</p><ul><li>Lightweight aluminum frame is durable and ready to hit the trails</li><li>Aggressive 24 x 2.0in. tires ready for hardpack, soft surfaces and muddy trails</li><li>Tektro Jr. hydraulic disc brakes with adjustable reach to match your child's hands</li><li>RST Capa MLC24 suspension fork has 50mm of travel and can be locked-out for ease of climbing</li><li>1x8 speed drivetrain pairs microSHIFT trigger shifters with a Shimano 12-32T cassette</li><li>32T narrow-wide chainring makes dropping your chain a thing of the past</li><li>620mm wide bars for control on bumpy trails</li><li>Preload feature on the fork adjusts for different rider weights</li><li>Lock-on grips prevents unwanted grip twisting and helps with control</li><li>Flat pedals provide good grip</li><li>Sized for kids from 8 to 11 years, or about 135 to 150cm (4ft. 5in. to 4ft. 11in.)</li><li>We put the Mountain back on our pint sized mountain bikes.
