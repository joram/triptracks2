  "description": "<p>Designed for light forestry work and small-scale felling, the Ekelund axe is a solid backwoods companion. This compact axe is handy to have at the cabin, strapped to the side of your pack or in your truck. The smooth hickory heartwood haft (axe-talk for handle) is comfortable in a variety of grips, from choked-up for fine work to dropped-back for chopping. Known for premium materials and classic technique, a Hultafors axe will serve your family for generations.</p><ul><li>Swedish tool steel head holds its edge and is incredibly tough</li><li>Head hung using a standard eye-to-haft so it\u2019s easy to replace the haft (this head will outlast the handle)</li><li>Heat-treated axe head is softer towards the handle and harder (58-9HRC) along the edge</li><li>American hickory haft provides excellent mechanical advantage</li><li>Linseed oil finish on the hickory haft</li><li>Leather sheath protects your hatchet\u2019s edge</li><li>Hultafors axe heads feature a lifetime warranty</li><li>Hand finishing means no 2 are exactly alike</li><li>Hand-forged in Hults Bruk, Sweden</li><li>Named after Gunnar Ekelund, a Swedish squire who initiated large-scale axe production in Hults Bruk in the late 1800s</li></ul>",
