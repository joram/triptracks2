They strike a good balance between lightweight construction for day hiking, and toughness to stand up to rough terrain. To-the-toe lacing offers a stable, precise fit. A low-density polyurethane insole offers excellent shock absorption, and the Biometric Trek sole keeps you from skidding or slipping on scree or loose gravel.</p><ul><li>Uppers are suede panels with nylon fabric cuffs for lightweight durability</li><li>GORE-TEX\u00ae Performance Comfort membrane for waterproofness and breathability</li><li>Toe rand protects your feet and your footwear</li><li>Flex point on upper allows for natural angle variation and reduces pressure points</li><li>Midsoles are lightweight polyurethane with EVA heel inserts for shock absorption</li><li>Outsoles Vibram\u00ae Biometric Trek with ACTIV Impact technology for cushy rebound</li></ul>",
