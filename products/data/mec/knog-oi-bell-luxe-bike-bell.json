  "description": "<p>Upgraded with a metal bracket and a CNC machined brass clapper, this posh version of the Oi Bell is sure to get some attention. Not happy with a passive-aggressive \"ping-ping-ping\" to announce yourself? This bell sounds a tone that says, \"respectfully requesting that you put down your phone and tune into the world around you, now, here, and in this moment we share.\" And says all that with a pleasant and distinctive ring.</p><ul><li>Small fits bars with 22.2mm diameters only</li><li>Large fits bars with 23.8 to 31.8mm diameters</li><li>Vegan leather shim</li><li>Cables fits nicely in the dedicated groove of the bell, keeping them organized</li><li>Low profile is stealthy enough for road bikes</li><li>Slots easily into a small space to keep your grips, brakes and shifter right where they are</li></ul>",
