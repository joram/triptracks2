Pull it out of your jacket pocket and wear alone or beneath your jacket hood. Despite its commando cach\u00e9, this particular watch cap is very sensitive and easy-going \u2013 the long fibres of its fine Italian merino wool are extremely soft, free from the prickliness of coarser wools.</p><ul><li>100% merino wool</li><li>One size fits most heads</li></ul>",
