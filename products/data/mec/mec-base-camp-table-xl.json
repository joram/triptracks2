  "description": "<p>If you\u2019ve never had a table in your campsite, you\u2019re in for a treat. If you have, you can imagine how nice it\u2019ll be to have a full-size one with supports that don\u2019t cross in the middle, so you can pull your chair right up to the edge. Legs with adjustable heights mean uneven campsites pose no threat to your very full cup of coffee or house of cards.</p><ul><li>Durable powdercoat finish keeps the table looking great for longer</li><li>Leg placement at the corners means there's actually room for your legs underneath</li><li>Height-adjustable legs let you keep your table level on uneven ground (maximum height = 70.3cm, minimum height = 46cm)</li><li>Zippered carry bag makes for easy packing</li></ul>",
