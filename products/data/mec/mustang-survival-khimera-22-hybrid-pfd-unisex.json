  "description": "<p>An innovative inflatable PFD that changes the rules of the game. The low-profile design offers 8 pounds of flotation for neutral buoyancy. If you hit the water, you can just re-board and carry on paddling. In emergency situations, trigger a manual inflation cell to fill the air bladders in the chest and upper back panels, and get a healthy 22 pounds of total buoyancy without having to re-jig the straps or make any complex adjustments. Great for stand up paddleboarding or paddlers who are comfortable with self-rescue and find it easier without a bulky PFD.</p><ul><li>Low-profile design is lightweight, maximizes range of motion and facilitates re-entry if you capsize</li><li>Foam panels provide 8 pounds of flotation to provide neutral buoyancy if you go in</li><li>Manually-triggered inflator adds more than 14 pounds of additional buoyancy</li><li>Comfortable mesh inner back panel helps manage moisture</li><li>Adjustable shoulder and side straps allow you to optimize fit</li><li>High visibility panels on shoulder straps, with attachment points for a rescue knife or  strobe light</li><li>Accommodates chest sizes from 30 to 52 inches</li><li>Minimum user weight of 90 pounds</li><li>Outer material is stretch spandex, which allows inflatable cells to expands and provides a comfortable stretch fit</li><li>Includes CO2 cylinder.
