  "description": "<p>Achieving and exceeding your fitness goals, has never looked so good. Outfitted with a brilliant AMOLED display the Forerunner 965 brings a new level of clarity and detail to your training sessions. With features like training readiness, that lets you know if your body is ready for that next training session, and evolving personalized daily workouts, the 965 makes it easier than ever to find your next level. The touchscreen makes scrolling and zooming through the pre-loaded maps, or any course you create, feel natural. Onboard multiband GPS pulls in speed, distance, and location data. While other sensors pay attention to how and where you train, factoring elevation and temperature into your performance. Running power and running dynamics now come right from your watch, no more accessories needed. Each morning the 965 delivers your morning report, summarizing sleep quality, recovery level, training effects, and other clutch training data. When you need extra information, or motivation, you can download training plans through the free Garmin Connect app. Connect lets you review activities, receive texts and other notifications, and more. Through your phone, the 965 can connect to multiple music services and can even hold up to 1000 songs.
