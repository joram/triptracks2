  "description": "<p>A small pack and light gear are key to moving fast in the mountains. The Harfang crampons take that to the next level. They use a burly webbing linking system instead of a standard bar, creating an ultra-packable, lightweight system that folds up small when not in use. The 3-piece construction is highly adjustable, allowing you to shift the middle points toward the toe or heel depending on your preference or boot size. Need them even lighter? Remove the antiballing systems, for a featherweight 377g per pair.</p><ul><li>Chromoly steel front piece provides great traction and durability</li><li>Aluminum mid and heel pieces keep the weight low</li><li>Ultralight 40mm UHMWPE and HTPE webbing replaces the standard linkage bars</li><li>Micro-adjustment dial on heel lever tunes the fit</li><li>TPU antiballing plate on each segment</li><li>Multiple toe bail positions let you customize the fit for different boots</li><li>Includes automatic toe bail and semi-auto toe basket</li><li>Storage bag included</li></ul>",
