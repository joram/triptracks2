  "description": "<p>What's about the size of a beer can but weighs half as much? The NeoAir UberLite is the smallest, lightest insulated sleeping pad ever. Crazy-light  fabric and internal reflective film shave grams. It inflates to 6.4cm of sleeping comfort but packs down small enough to delight the ultralight crowd.</p><ul><li>Ultralight 15-denier high-tenacity nylon</li><li>WingLock valve with 1-way airflow inflates 3 times faster than conventional valves and is simple to use even with gloves on</li><li>To deflate, simply twist the wing valve to open</li><li>Triangle core matrix is stable and has a heat-trapping reflective film</li><li>Air-only pads have no insulation that can be compromised by moisture, often added when you inflate them by mouth</li><li>Includes a pump sack, stuff sack and repair kit</li></ul>",
