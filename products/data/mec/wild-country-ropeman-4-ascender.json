  "description": "<p>The Ropeman 4 makes a great alternative to prusiks or heavier ascenders. It is essentially an incomplete ascender until you add a locking carabiner to it. The carabiner acts as the spine against which the cam presses the rope. This version has an improved closure mechanism that prevents the lateral sideplate from opening and ensures that rope doesn\u2019t get stuck between the sideplate and cam.</p><ul><li>Stainless steel cam, aluminum side plates</li><li>Forged side plates work with a range of carabiner types and shapes</li><li>Works with ropes from 8 to 13mm</li><li>Compatible with flat and tubular slings from 10 mm to 15 mm</li><li>2kN strength</li><li>CE certified</li></ul>",
