  "description": "<p>The boon of these road pedals is their super-fast and easy engagement. The retention system holds the rear clasp partially open after release, so you don't have to overcome tension to clip back in. They also have a carbon flexion blade instead of a traditional metal spring, keeping the weight down, and oversized platforms to give you some stomp.</p><ul><li>Composite body with a steel axle</li><li>ICLIC makes getting rolling easier, as every time you unclip the retention system stays open, letting just slide right in and ride</li><li>3 levels of retention gives you options</li><li>Pedal platform is 700 square/mm for excellent power transfer and a good surface area to weight ratio</li><li>Stainless steel metal plate wears well and is replaceable</li><li>Pontoon sides on cleats provide comfortable walking</li><li>Minimal distance from sole to pedal axle</li><li>2.5mm of lateral float with the included Free cleats</li><li>16\u00b0 release angle</li></ul>",
