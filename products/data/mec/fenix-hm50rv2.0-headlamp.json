  "description": "<p>Small weight, small size, big brightness. Smaller and lighter than most headlamps, yet even brighter, the HM50R V2.0 is a worth a look. Generation 2 of this compact headlamp gets 200 more lumens, a handy clip, and a red light mode. With 4 white lighting modes that take you from 32 lumens to 700, you get a light that works around camp, on pre-dawn trail runs. The 2 red light modes are great for early starts and answering the call of nature without waking your tent mates. USB charging makes it easy to top up the included 16340 battery. It's also compatible with CR123 batteries for better cold-weather performance.</p><ul><li>6 modes, 4 white: turbo (1h at 700 lumens), high (3h at 400 lumens), medium (8h at 120 lumens), low (42h at 30 lumens), 2 in red: solid (60h at 5 lumens) and flashing (120h at 5 lumens)</li><li>Rugged aluminum body has type-III hard anodizing for an extra level of protection</li><li>Precision-engineered optical lens provides a mix of flood and spot lighting</li><li>Covered USB-C port makes charging easy, charging from empty in just 1.5 hours</li><li>LED power indicator lets you know how your battery is doing, whether charging or discharging</li><li>1-button operation is easy to use, with or without gloves</li><li>Intelligent circuitry remembers the last mode you were in</li><li>Lockout mode keeps your light from coming on when you don\u2019t want it on</li><li>Can be easily adapted into a compact flashlight</li><li>Stainless steel clip gives you mounting options</li><li>Silicone strip on the back of the head strap helps keep it in place</li><li>Perforated, reflective headband wicks away sweat and helps keep you seen</li><li>Compact design: 6.4 x 3.6 x 3.2cm</li><li>In the box: Fenix HM50R, spare O-ring, ARB-L16-700 lithium-ion battery, USB-C charging cable, user manual and warranty card</li></ul>",
