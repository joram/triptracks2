  "description": "<p>A light touring ski that performs in a range of conditions, because you can't pick your snow conditions, but you can pick your skis. With a wood core from toe to tail and carbon reinforcements to stiffen it up, the UBAC 102 lets you reach deep mountain terrain and quickly lap your skintrack for another run. Double rocker provides extra float in powder, and still performs on crud and hardpack.</p><ul><li>Paulownia wood core reinforced with multi-fiber for power, energy and dampness</li><li>Snowphobic scratch-resistant polyamide topsheet</li><li>ABS sidewalls are durable and shock-resistant</li><li>Medium camber underfoot with rockered tip and tail, floats on soft snow and holds an edge on hardpack</li><li>Short turning radius allows control in variable conditions</li><li>Versatile 102mm waist</li><li>Phenol reinforcement plate accommodates a wide range of bindings</li><li>Sintered base for excellent glide and shock resistance</li><li>Hardened steel edges resist corrosion and nicks</li><li>Zag launched the ZAGreen program in 2017 to help lower the environmental impact of the ski industry.
