  "description": "<p>Tough as its namesake bear, the Kodiak has a big scoop for moving lots of snow in a hurry. The blade also mounts at right angles to the shaft to make an adze that excels at tunnelling and excavating snow caves.</p><ul><li>Can be used as a shovel or at a 90\u00b0 angle for maximum snow clearing</li><li>Made of hardened and anodized aluminum for lightness and durability</li><li>D-grip is more compact and features a rubberized grip zone</li><li>Oval shaft improves stiffness and makes locking the shaft in extended position easy</li><li>Rubberized grip zone on the shaft makes it non-slip</li><li>High sidewalls and pronounced centre ridge makes for a very stiff blade</li></ul>",
