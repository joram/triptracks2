  "description": "<p>No one wants to waste time being lost, not when there are vistas to be had. The latest addition to Garmin\u2019s eTrex line helps you make the most out of your time outside. Improved antenna technology gives you the strongest GPS signal the eTrex has ever seen. Multi-GNSS signal reception allows more simultaneous satellite connections and gives the eTrex SE more satellites to choose from. More satellites for the GPS, means a stronger signal for you, a real plus when under heavy tree cover or in other challenging terrain. Improved battery life is another huge plus for the SE. Previous eTrex GPS would run for about 25 hours, the SE offers nearly 7x that in regular mode, and 72x that in expedition mode. Connectivity has made it to the eTrex line in a big way. When paired with your phone or tablet running the free Garmin Explore app, you can plan trips, access topographical maps, create waypoints and routes, then sync it all to your GPS. Your phone\u2019s connection also gives you access to active weather information. Detailed weather forecasts for your location, a specific waypoint, or a GPS coordinate, as well as real-time radar tracking, help you to stay one step ahead of bad weather. Your phone will even send alerts, notifications, and more, helping you stay as connected (or disconnected) as you want to be.</p><ul><li>Multi-GNSS signal reception supports: GPS, GLONASS, and Galileo satellite constellations, providing a faster and more accurate positioning and elevation data</li><li>Garmin Explore\u2122 website and app let you sync routes, tracks and waypoints to your device. You can download map data to your phone, use your phone to plan routes and tracks, and then send those plans to your GPS, all without cell reception</li><li>Breadcrumb trails track your trek, navigate you to a saved location or entered coordinate (there are no maps for routing), or navigate you on the trail you took back to where you started</li><li>Geocaching Live uses the connection to your phone to provide live cache updates, cache descriptions, logs, and can even provide hints for those times you know you\u2019re close and just need a little help</li><li>Active weather provides real-time radar tracking (via a connected phone running Garmin Explore)</li><li>Compass helps keep you headed in the right direction, even when you\u2019re standing still</li><li>Rugged housing is IPX7 water-resistant, dustproof and has an easy-to-read display</li><li>2 AA batteries run for 7 days in regular mode, or 3 months in expedition mode (less frequent GPS check-ins).  And, as the AA is the world\u2019s most common battery it is simple to keep your GPS up and running nearly anywhere</li><li>Improved display provides sharper contrast, making it easy to read in all conditions</li><li>USB-C connectivity</li><li>In the box: eTrex SE and documentation</li></ul>",
