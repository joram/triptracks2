  "description": "<p>Agility is the key benefit of these trekking or light alpine boots. The waterproof membrane keeps your feet dry on bushy and damp approaches and the custom fit is a boon for fast-moving ridgeline scrambles. They're more breathable than a 4-season alpine boot, but are compatible with crampons, so you can boot across a pocket glacier or quickly ascend a deep moat or 'shrund.</p><ul><li>L-Tech nylon and water-resistant Microtech upper</li><li>Padded collar for maximum comfort</li><li>HDry\u00ae waterproof membrane seals out moisture</li><li>Flex-point upper design for natural walking motion</li><li>Self-moulding ankle padding for a custom fit</li><li>Pro-Fiber XT 20 insole insulates and supports</li><li>Multi-density PU and EVA midsole provides shock absorption and maintains sensitivity</li><li>Outsoles are Vibram\u00ae Pentax Precision XT rubber for grip in variable terrain</li></ul>",
