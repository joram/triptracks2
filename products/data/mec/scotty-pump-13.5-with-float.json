  "description": "<p>This solidly constructed pump lets you empty a flooded kayak much faster than a scoop bailer would. If you are rafted up with another kayak or stabilized with a paddlefloat, the pump can also be thrust down the waist tunnel of your fastened sprayskirt, allowing you to pump out the cockpit without it being constantly reflooded by incoming waves.</p><ul><li>Conspicuously coloured foam collar keeps the pump from sinking and floats it in an upright position</li><li>Solid brass piston rod for strength and durability</li><li>Large handle allows easy operation, even with gloves on</li><li>Easily disassembled for cleaning</li></ul>",
