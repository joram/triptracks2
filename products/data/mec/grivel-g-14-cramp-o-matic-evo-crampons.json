  "description": "<p>The G-14 combine the front points found on steep ice models with the horizontal semi-rigid frames favoured on more general-purpose mountain models. The result is crampons that can be used by alpinists everywhere, but are particularly suited to moving on steep ice and mixed terrain. Quick to put on, these bindings are designed for mountaineering boots that have a rigid sole and substantial heel and toe welts.</p><ul><li>Chromoly steel and three-dimensional stamping for strength</li><li>EVO binding is simpler and lighter than previous bindings system</li><li>Strong vertical front points are hooded for horizontal resistance in softer conditions</li><li>Horizontal frame keeps the crampons close to the boots for balance and to reduce snow build-up</li><li>Collapsible frame stows compactly</li><li>Simple single-screw front-point attachment allows easy conversion between dual and monopoint</li><li>Includes antibot plate with active snow-expelling design</li></ul>",
