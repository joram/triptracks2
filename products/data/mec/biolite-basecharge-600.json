  "description": "<p>Take your remote office, really remote. With more than enough power to keep both office essentials, and good times essentials powered, the BaseCharge 600 lets you take the best of the grid with you. With years of creating clever off-grid power solutions and powerbanks, BioLite has created a line of all-in-one power station that lets you plug-in your favourite at home electronics, wherever you roam.
