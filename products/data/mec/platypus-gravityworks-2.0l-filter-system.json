  "description": "<p>This gravity fed system offers a high-flow capacity. Fill the unfiltered water reservoir, raise, and hang it. The output hose on the side of the water reservoir allows sediment to settle, reducing line blockage and the need for flushing. Filtered water is collected in a bottle with a push-pull cap, ready for use. The fibres in these filters are slightly more brittle than ceramic filters, and somewhat more susceptible to damage from impact. The cartridge is encased in a protective rubber shell, and drop-tested to 7 feet, but consider carrying a spare cartridge on long trips, as they are small, light, and inexpensive enough to carry a backup.</p><ul><li>Reservoir is made of silver ion-treated polyethylene film that doesn't pick up tastes</li><li>Silicon tubing</li><li>Filters 2L of water in less than 3 minutes</li><li>2L version is light enough for backpacking, but practical for basecamps</li><li>Hollow fibre filter has a high surface-area that allows water to flow quickly through a 0.2 micron effective pore size</li><li>Removes 99.99% of all bacteria and protozoa</li><li>Nominal 1500L filter life is for clear water, turbidity will reduce the useful life of any filter</li><li>Do not allow the cartridge to freeze after initial use</li><li>Quick-disconnect valve automatically cuts the flow of water when the hose is disconnected</li><li>Clip-style shut-off valve on output hose between reservoir and bottle</li><li>Includes: 2L dirty water collection reservoir with quick-release fitting, 2L Platy bottle with push/pull cap, filter cartridge, in-line adapter and hoses</li></ul>",
