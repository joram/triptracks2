  "description": "<p>The beauty of a soft bottle lies in the fact that, once empty, it compacts smaller than most water bottles. The opening is a standard size, so the Seeker 6L works with other lids. The included plug-and-play (PNP) lid and Camp Tap nozzle allow controlled pouring, great for refilling bottles or doing the dishes. Ideal for carrying extra water on a hike, paddling tour, road trip or anywhere else you need water and carry space is limited.</p><ul><li>Camp tap makes precise pouring and flow control easy</li><li>Soft, grip-able TPU is RF welded to create leakproof bonds</li><li>BPA-free, PVC-free and meets or exceeds FDA and EU regulations</li><li>Multiple lash points make it easy to attach to a pack, kayak deck, or nearly anywhere else you need it</li><li>Soft bail handle is comfy to carry and doubles as a retention loop when the bottle is rolled up</li><li>Internal baffles create some structure, and also give you something to hold onto</li><li>Works with HydraPak\u2019s PNP accessories and inline filter (not included)</li><li>42mm cap allows you to drink and pour with ease</li><li>Can be frozen or filled with warm water (max temp 60\u00b0C)</li><li>Dimensions: 44 x 18.5cm</li></ul>",
