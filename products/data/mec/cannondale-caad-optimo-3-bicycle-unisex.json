  "description": "<p>If you\u2019re looking for a step up from the Optimo 4, but don\u2019t need the 10-speed drivetrain of the Optimo 2, the Optimo 3 is your bike.  Built on the race tested Optimo frame, the CAAD Optimo 3 lets you battle with the pack on weekend club rides and makes your daily commute a bit more enjoyable. The proven frame delivers the same geometry and handling of a high-end road bike, while saving you some money for kit. Outfitted with an 18-speed Sora drivetrain, you get Shimano reliability, without the higher cost of top-end groupsets. And the dual pivot Promax brakes, keep the potential speed of your new road bike right where you want it.</p><ul><li>Smartform C2 alloy frame with a carbon blade fork and performance cyclocross geometry</li><li>Shimano Sora groupset with FSA Vero cranks</li><li>Promax RC-452 dual pivot caliper brakes offer reliable stopping power</li><li>2x9 drivetrain pairs 50-34T chain rings with an 11-30T cassette</li><li>SAVE\u2122 Micro-suspension uses strategically engineered flex zones in the rear triangle to smooth out the ride</li><li>Subtle rack and Fender mounts in the rear triangle</li><li>Vittoria Zaffiro tires have confidence inspiring traction and a smooth roll</li><li>Bikes are covered by MEC's Rocksolid Guarantee and Bike Service Agreement.
