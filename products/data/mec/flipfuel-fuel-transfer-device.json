  "description": "<p>If you\u2019ve ever found yourself with more than one sort-of-full fuel canister, then this little gadget is for you. The FlipFuel is a quick and easy way to turn 2 half-empty canisters into 1 full canister. With fuel canister threads on both sides and a valve that controls much like your canister stove does, the FlipFuel lets you transfer fuel from 1 canister to another. So, whether you want to fill an empty small canister from a large canister for an overnighter, or combine any partial canisters into a couple full ones, the FlipFuel has you covered.</p><ul><li>Works with isobutane fuel canisters</li><li>Bleed button lets you vent out excess fuel if you accidentally overfill a canister</li><li>For best results, your intake canister should be cold, and your output canister should be warm</li><li>Canisters are marked with content weight, so if you want precise transfers, use a kitchen scale to dial in your fills</li><li>Use in a well ventilated area</li></ul>",
