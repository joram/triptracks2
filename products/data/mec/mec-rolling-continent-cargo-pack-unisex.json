  "description": "<p>Rolling suitcases are convenient... until you discover that your hotel is actually at the bottom of a narrow cobblestone footpath. Luckily, the Rolling Continent Cargo Pack has a hidden superpower: a deployable backpack strap system that makes it easy to shoulder your load. The mesh backpanel and adjustable padded shoulder straps make it surprisingly comfortable in backpack mode. As a rolling suitcase, it has wheels that corner well and a telescoping handle that helps you weave and hustle to the departure gate. After extensive field testing for durability, including being thrown down stairs and rattled around baggage carousels, it's up for any adventure.</p><ul><li>Made of durable 420-denier polyester with a polyurethane coating and a DWR finish for excellent water resistance</li><li>Main compartment has a large mesh zippered pocket under the lid and 2 compression straps with buckles</li><li>Internal/external frame moves weight onto your hips for easier carrying in backpack mode and protects from bumps in rolling mode</li><li>Telescoping handle has a push button</li><li>Height-adjustable shoulder harness has padded contoured shoulder straps</li><li>Breathable mesh back panel allows air circulation</li><li>Webbing grab handle on top and side</li><li>Padded, contoured hipbelt uses several foam densities for a comfortable fit</li><li>Zippered panel covers the shoulder straps and hipbelt in suitcase mode and to protect them if you check the bag.
