  "description": "<p>A lightweight, powder and freeride hybrid splitboard for human-powered snow surfing. The Ecplise has a wide nose and narrow tail for optimal float in the soft stuff, and a multi-radial profile for agility in tight trees. A powerful core of poplar and bamboo keeps this board smooth and surfy while tip to tail carbon stringers give it a little extra pop. It's held together with Karakoram Ultraclips that maintain compression between sides, even as the board ages.</p><ul><li>Poplar and bamboo wood core is energetic and damping</li><li>Carbon fibre stringers from tip to tail provides stiffness and pop</li><li>Castor bean top sheet sheds snow, adds impact resistance and is eco-friendly</li><li>Triaxial fibreglass offers a good balance of flex and torsional control</li><li>Polyurethane sidewall construction increases torsional stability</li><li>Directional multi-radial camber-rocker profile provides control on big lines</li><li>Karakorum UltraClips 2.0 tip and tail clips give you a solid riding feel</li><li>Sintered 4000 base has great wax retention for a fast ride</li></ul>",
