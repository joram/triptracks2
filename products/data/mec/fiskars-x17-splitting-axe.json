  "description": "<p>Buck up that pile of firewood fast with this hungry axe. With its long shaft and flared cheeks, the X17 puts ample mechanical advantage behind your swing, so you get to work smarter, not harder. From feeding the wood stove at the cabin, to stoking the fires of basecamp, this axe bites deep into wood and splits more reliably with one strike than traditional axes. Less time chopping and splitting means more time roasting marshmallows. The plastic edge cover secures with a rotating clip and makes a great handle, lash point, or way to hang the hatchet when not in use.</p><ul><li>Flared cheeks increase mechanical advantage, making splitting large rounds easier than with a standard axe</li><li>Tempered and forged steel holds an edge for a long time</li><li>Fibreglass-reinforced polymer shaft is moulded around the head</li><li>Hollow handle is light enough to strap to a pack or bring on a canoe trip</li><li>Edge cover and carry handle included</li><li>Fiskars recommends this axe for splitting small to medium sized logs</li></ul>",
