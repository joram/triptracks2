  "description": "<p>The venerable Tricam evolves! They now have an additional placement mode: you can use them in their active camming mode and in two different passive modes. A wider section at the top of the head creates an extra taper, which also lends stability in camming placements. The slings get stiffer too, the inner webbing band extends further toward the head and has a new stitch pattern to make it stiffer. The new sling design is more durable and the extra layer of material adds better protection when places over a sharp edge.</p><ul><li>Tricams works where nothing else fits: solution pockets, pods, and they are excellent in horizontal cracks</li><li>Stiffer sling makes one-handed placements easier, but still allows them to engage when placed in active camming mode. Makes removal easier too</li><li>Includes sizes: 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5</li></ul>",
