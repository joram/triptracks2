From sub-zero temperatures to big snowfall days, the Fall-Line jacket covers young shredders thanks to thick ThermoLite insulation and MEC's own VarioShell waterproof-breathable membrane. A snow skirt prevents powder from sluffing up inside the jacket, and the helmet compatible hood, lift pass pocket and Recco reflector mean they're all set to spend winter days on the slopes.</p><ul><li>2-layer recycled nylon shell with MEC's VarioShell waterproof-breathable membrane and critically taped seams</li><li>Shell has a durable water repellency finish (DWR) that sheds snow and repels light rain</li><li>60g ThermoLite T3 EcoMade medium loft insulation (85% recycled) has high warmth for it's weight</li><li>Recycled polyester lining glides over layers</li><li>Soft microfleece chin guard and collar keeps neck cozy when the hood is down</li><li>Helmet-compatible hood has an elasticized gusset to seal out drafts</li><li>Built-in Recco\u00ae Rescue System reflector allows ski patrol and mountain rescue teams to detect and locate it</li><li>Zipper pulls can be operated when wearing gloves</li><li>2 zippered handwarmer pockets and hidden zippered pocket on left sleeve for a ski pass</li><li>Velcro\u00ae cuff closures</li><li>Powder skirt snaps closed with an additional snap to keep it out of the way when not in use.
