  "description": "<p>The Air Traffic Controller (or ATC) is a hybrid-style device that offers smooth rope feeding when paying out rope or lowering. The design creates an assisted lock (it's not an autolocking device) but it allows you to transfer some of a climber's weight to the device for gradual lowering and smooth landings.</p><ul><li>Made of durable abrasion-resistant stainless steel</li><li>High braking performance to catch falls safely</li><li>Smooth handling, even for larger-diameter ropes</li><li>For use with single ropes only</li></ul>",
