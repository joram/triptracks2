  "description": "<p>Take the pressure off on your commute or rides around town. This saddle is tailored to those who typically sit at a more upright  (60-degree) spine angle. The shape is just a little on the wide side, to accommodate the sit bones being further back. Additionally, the flexible Royalgel padding reduces peak pressure by up to 40%.</p><ul><li>Tasteful silver anti-scuff caps at sides prevent scratches</li><li>Sealed surface is partially transparent, allowing riders to observe how the Royalgel padding flexes and reacts</li><li>Integrated clip system allows easy attachment of lights or saddle bags</li></ul>",
