  "description": "<p>A bigger brighter screen, stronger GPS, and some of the best runtimes available, Suunto\u2019s latest smartwatch is easy to love. One of the most noticeable advancements comes from pairing cutting edge antenna technology with Suunto\u2019s latest GPS chipset. This combination enables the Vertical to receive dual frequency and multi-band GPS signals, keeping you connected when your route winds through valleys and mountain ranges, or canyons of glass and steel. Preloaded with multi-layer topographical maps, you choose the view, whether you\u2019re route planning, on the trail, or navigating urban jungles. When it is time to train, there are 95+ activity profiles, so the Vertical is ready for your next ride or your next open water swim. Updated environmental sensors keep you in the know, providing forecasts and even air quality information. Activity tracking records steps and calories, as well as monitors the quality of your sleep. All of this 24/7 performance data is used to calculate your recovery times and track fitness journey.</p><ul><li>Made in a factory powered by 100% renewable, carbon-free energy</li><li>Each watch is fully carbon offset via trees planted by Tree-Nation, an internationally recognized non-profit dedicated to reforestation</li><li>Dual frequency and multi-band signal reception and expanded GNSS support (GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, QZSS and BeiDou) provide faster and more accurate positioning and elevation data, connecting simultaneously to up to 5 networks and 32 satellites</li><li>Shaded topographic maps for North America are preloaded with more regions available for free download over Wi-Fi</li><li>Point of interest navigation with ETAs</li><li>Snap-to-Route matches your GPS track to your preloaded route (aka a .GPX file), removing inaccuracies along the way, providing a precise track</li><li>Heatmaps display other Suunto user\u2019s activities over local maps, making it easy to find the best runs, rides, trails, or swims, anywhere you go</li><li>FusedTrack\u2122 uses data from the internal sensors to plot your route between GPS points. By combining the data, you get a track that mirrors your actual track, and fewer GPS check-ins equals longer battery life</li><li>FusedSpeed\u2122 combines GPS and accelerometer data to provide a more stable running pace and normalized graded pace</li><li>Running power comes right off of your wrist, no pod needed</li><li>Optical heart rate monitor provides blood oxygen level info and constant heart rate data</li><li>Strava Live Segment integration lets you know when your starred segments are about to begin and displays your progress.
