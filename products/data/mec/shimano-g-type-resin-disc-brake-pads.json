  "description": "<p>Replacement pads and springs for Shimano disc brakes. Updated with a new resin compound, these pads last up to 50% longer than the previous generation. Compared to metal pads, the resin compound is quiet, generates less heat, and offers more progressive stopping power (no sudden braking). The only compromise? Resin has a shorter lifespan than metal, especially under wet conditions.</p><ul><li>Comes with 1 left and 1 right pad, and 1 spring for 1 set of brakes</li><li>To replace both front and rear brakes, you will require 2 sets of these brake pads</li><li>Fits 2-piston SLX and XT calipers from 10 to 12 speed groupsets and 10 or 11 speed XTR brakes</li><li>Interchangeable with F-Type and J-Type pads</li></ul>",
