  "description": "<p>A compact and lightweight probe thanks to its length of 240cm. Instead of a dangling pull-cable, the Stealth Quick-Lock system consists of a tube nested into the first probe section. It makes it smaller in your pack, and quick to deploy: just pull the trigger and the probe extends to its full length.</p><ul><li>Laser-etched depth markings are easy to read and highly resistant to wear</li><li>Tip penetrates debris easily</li></ul>",
