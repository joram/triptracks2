  "description": "<p>If you\u2019re looking to float over the softest terrain, wider is better. Wider than the 4s the Dillinger 5 offer more grip on soft surfaces and while cornering. If your fat bike needs a new set of winter tires or you just want to try riding all year-round, the Dillinger 5s will keep you rolling when the trails are covered in snow. Outfitted with 252 studs, you will roll smoothly on ice and frozen dirt.</p><ul><li>252 hardened steel studs bite into snow and ice</li><li>Lugged sidewall for traction while cornering</li><li>Tubeless ready for those low PSI powder crawling moments</li><li>45NRTH does not recommend these tires for use with e-bikes, as the additional torque leads to premature stud loss</li></ul>",
