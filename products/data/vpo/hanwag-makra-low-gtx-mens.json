  "description": "Soaks up plenty of punishment! The low-cut version of the Makra Combi GTX has a high-quality, abrasion-resistant leather and Cordura\u00ae upper. Its lightweight design and compact size means that stores away easily in a climbing pack, making it the ideal approach shoe for fast-moving, technical terrain. We equip it with a weight-optimised, aggressive sole that ensures outstanding grip and traction. And thanks to the GORE-TEX lining, it will also keep your feet dry in wet conditions.<br><br>*** All Hanwag shoes are sold under UK sizing - Please see size chart for details/conversion.",
