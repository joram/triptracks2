  "description": "The Pelmo Pants for men was developed specifically for the needs of mountaineers who have to rely on their clothing on long days - and still want to be light on the road.<br><br>Cut and designed with Shield Zero material, the Pelmo Pants are ready for any hard-fought elevation gain. The pants are cut narrower at the leg as well as at the hem and have a pre-shaped knee area, which gives the lightweight alpine mountain pants an optimal fit.<br>In addition, versatile all-rounder scores with high breathability, a low weight, high elasticity and the extremely robust material mix. Inserts with merino wool in the waistband and pockets provide maximum comfort in the right places.<br><br>All this has made the Pelmo Pants for men a deserved classic. The PFC-free pants are an excellent companion on all alpine ventures where lightness and functionality are required.",
