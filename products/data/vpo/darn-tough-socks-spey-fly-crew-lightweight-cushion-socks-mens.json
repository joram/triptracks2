  "description": "Paying homage to a classic fly-fishing technique, the Spey Fly sock takes its name from Scotland\u2019s River Spey and inspiration from our own fly-fishing guru and Mill patriarch, Marc Cabot. He\u2019s the real deal. This lightweight lifestyle sock is too. It features terry loops knit under foot for cozy cushioning and our signature Merino Wool durable construction. While you may never reel in stream dolphins like Marc does, you can sport the same socks.",
