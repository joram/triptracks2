  "description": "Stay warm, dry, and well ventilated on exposed mountain runs with this technical windproof shell. Constructed using Pertex\u00ae Quantum Air to protect you from turbulent winds without compromising breathability, the Windveil Jacket offers you enhanced protection from the elements during intense activity. Strategically placed Motiv\u2122 jersey panels help to wick away sweat and control odour, making an ultra-breathable, fast-drying, lightweight windproof jacket with exceptional next-to-skin comfort.<br><br>The body-mapped fabric positioning has been deliberately designed to efficiently regulate your heat and sweat, particularly when you\u2019re wearing it with a hydration vest. Elasticated cuffs allow you to quickly check your progress on your sports watch or activity tracker and are extended to protect your hands from the cold on blustery ridges. The hem drawcord helps to seal out wind chill, while the lightweight full-length zip provides additional venting when you\u2019re attacking an incline. Your gels or card can be stored in the small back pocket, which doubles up as a stuff sack for the jacket when it\u2019s not needed.",
