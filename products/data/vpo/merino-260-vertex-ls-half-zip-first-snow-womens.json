  "description": "A heavyweight merino base layer top with a unique jacquard pattern fabric, the 250 Vertex Long Sleeve Half Zip First Snow is a go-to layering piece for skiing, snowshoeing and other cold-weather pursuits. The super soft and breathable 260gm jacquard fabric is made from 100% merino wool, and the classic half-zip design makes for easy layering and quick temperature regulation. Gusseted underarms increase range of motion, while flatlock stitching and offset seams throughout makes for a soft next-to-skin feel. The all-over graphic print draws inspiration from the fractal structure of a snowflake. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Inspired by nature, icebreaker harnesses the performance qualities of natural fibres to offer an alternative to clothing based on petrochemical synthetics. Merino is an annually renewable fibre that naturally resists odours, keeps you cool when it\u2019s hot and warm when it\u2019s not, and lets your skin breathe for comfort all day, every day.",
