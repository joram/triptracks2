  "description": "Marmot upped the puff to 700-fill-power on their classic Ares Vest to give you just the right amount of warmth for everyday use from the backyard to the backcountry. The Ares is a classic puffy down vest that packs a seriously warm punch with retro style and super lightweight packable performance that feels equally at home logging miles on the foot track as it does waiting at the tracks on your commute home. Whether you're next stop is the summit, the office, or happy hour at your local brewery, the Ares will keep you company from early starts to late nights all year round.",
