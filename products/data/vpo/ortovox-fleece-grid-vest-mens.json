  "description": "On alpine adventures&nbsp;their equipment must be lightweight but also warm and functional. It must function in the valley just as it does during ice cold climbs to the summit. <br><br>The Fleece Grid line is thus the ideal companion in the mountains: Thanks to its inner channel structure, this fleece vest for men is light but can also trap air and heat through insulating air pockets. A Fleece Light insert in the chest area and double-layered breast pocket provide additional lightweight protection against the wind. During hours of intensive movement, the material composition boasts excellent stretchability and provides ventilation thanks to its inner channel structure. The temperature-regulating properties are supported by fine merino wool on the inside: Tasmanian virgin wool regulates the moisture and temperature levels, is quick drying and has odor neutralizing characteristics. <br><br>Merino wool also makes it comfortable to wear. The two breast pockets provide room for storing maps, cell phone or trail bars. The collar provides additional protection against wind and weather.",
