  "description": "<p>The new edition of a popular classic. From a relaxed hike to a demanding multi-day tour, with the Runbold Shorts, you\u2019ll feel good on all distances on hot summer days. The polyamide and spandex material mix is very robust, feels pleasant to wear and allows you to move freely. The miDori fiber finish improves moisture-wicking and ensures the shorts dry faster. The waistband can be adjusted for a perfect fit. Thanks to a total of four zippered pockets, essential items are always close to hand. What\u2019s more, the Runbold take up so little space you can take them with you wherever you go.</p>",
