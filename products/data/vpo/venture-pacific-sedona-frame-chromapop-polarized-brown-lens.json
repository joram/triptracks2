  "description": "Where snow falls, you follow. On summit bids or high-speed descents, the Smith Venture sunglasses provide much-needed eye protection in alpine environments. They're our take on glacier glasses, with removable side shields that protect against light reflecting off snow, rock and ice. ChromaPop\u2122, lens technology offers a terrain-boosting view of every wind drift and crevasse. Autolock hinges make for easy on and off when one of your hands is occupied with an ice axe or ski poles. And then there are the iconic round frames that look just as good glissading down a snowfield as relaxing post adventure.",
