  "description": "The Light version of Mammut's classic is perfect for outdoor summer activities and those in-between seasons. The premium fleece made of Polartec\u00ae Power Grid\u2122 material is light, incredibly soft and super comfortable on the skin. The patented waffle structure offers an excellent warmth-to-weight ratio and keeps the jacket extra breathable. It also dries quickly and packs down small. <br><br>The Aconcagua Light Hoody can be worn on its own or as a mid-layer when mountaineering, climbing, ski touring or hiking. The tight-fitting cut makes it easy to wear under a hardshell or insulated jacket. The hood also has a tight fit and can be worn easily under a helmet. Out in the mountains or going about your daily business, the Aconcagua Light is versatile, functional and stylish.",
