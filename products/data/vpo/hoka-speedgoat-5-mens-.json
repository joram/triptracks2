  "description": "A workhorse designed for technical trails, the Speedgoat returns with less weight and more traction than ever before. A new shoe from outsole to laces, this trail beast is updated with Vibram\u00ae Megagrip with Traction Lug for enhanced grip on loose soil. Retaining the same stack height and rocker profile, the Speedgoat 5 employs a lighter midsole compound and heartier, double layer jacquard mesh to inspire confidence on any terrain.",
