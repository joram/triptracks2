  "description": "More than half of the mountain goats on Planet Earth live here in BC and Alberta. Mountain goats spend their winters safely up high to avoid predators, often loosing 25% of their body weight over the winter. With short legs, mountain goats are often stranded for the winter. Incredibly agile, they can gallop at full speed across steep talus slopes if spooked.",
