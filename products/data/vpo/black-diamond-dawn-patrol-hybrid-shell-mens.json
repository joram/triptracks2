  "description": "Black Diamond's backcountry shell engineered to provide protection from the storm while remaining breathable on the uphill skin, the Dawn Patrol Hybrid Shell features a breathable softshell fabric in key placements for thermal regulation, while the chest, shoulders and hood remain impenetrable thanks to their propriety BD.dry\u2122 waterproof/breathable solution. All fabric is treated with GTT\u2019s Empel PFC-Free finish, an environmentally friendly DWR that\u2019s superior in durability and performance. Add 4-way stretch for mobility and this shell keeps you hustling on the skin track while sending it on the way down. An innovative, center front dual zipper features a built-in mesh panel for venting on the climb, and the perforated panel on the collar allows you to breath freely while protecting your face from the brisk air. The Dawn Patrol Hybrid comes with two harness-compatible chest pockets that hold skins, an internal media pocket and a ski-helmet compatible hood. Velcro cuffs are combined with a lightweight wrist gaiter for ultimate protection.",
