Made with Icebreaker's jersey Cool-Lite\u2122 fabric that blends natural merino wool with TENCEL\u2122 Lyocell to manage sweat and resist odours, the ZoneKnit also features strategically placed panels of eyelet Cool-Lite\u2122 mesh to help actively regulate body temperature. Raglan sleeves and gusseted underarms provide enhanced mobility, and flatlock stitching eliminates chafing. <br><br>Soft merino and TENCEL\u2122 Lyocell, sourced from responsible eucalyptus plantations, combine to create Icebreaker Cool-Lite\u2122, a fabric that helps to regulate your body\u2019s microclimate. Inspired by nature, Icebreaker harnesses the performance qualities of natural fibres to offer an alternative to clothing based on petrochemical synthetics.",
