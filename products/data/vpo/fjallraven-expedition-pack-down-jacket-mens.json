Easy to pull on for extra warmth when you take a break, and just as easy to compress into its own inner pocket when you don\u2019t need it. Padded with one layer of ethically produced down in stitch-through channels with synthetic insulation over the shoulders for extra resistance against pressure and moisture. Part of Fj\u00e4llr\u00e4ven\u2019s Expedition Series with iconic designs, sustainably produced materials and high reliability in cold conditions.",
