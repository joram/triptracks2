  "description": "The swisswool piz bo\u00e8 jacket for men is ideal for the discerning ski tourer who knows that less is more: less weight, less volume but more performance.<br><br>The robust pertex\u00ae quantum shell makes the lightweight insulating jacket extremely windproof and abrasion resistant, with the quilted outer fabric providing a stylish pixel look. A 60 g/m2 swisswool\u00ae lining not only provides excellent insulation against the cold, the fibers also have a moisture-regulating function, absorbing up to 35% of their own weight in moisture. Thanks to its athletic cut and elastic merino naturetec light inserts under the arms, the swisswool piz bo\u00e8 jacket for men adapts to your every move, even in the most demanding terrain.<br><br>The tight-fitting, elastic hood, elastic waistband and cuffs keep the wind and cold at bay on freezing summits. The two generous front pockets and breast pocket provide space for items you need to keep at hand, even if you have a backpack or belt.<br><br>The swisswool piz bo\u00e8 jacket for men is therefore the ideal companion for demanding tours, where low weight and maximum performance are required.",
