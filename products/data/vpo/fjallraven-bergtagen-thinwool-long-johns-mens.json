  "description": "So soft, you probably won\u2019t want to take them off. And why should you? Bergtagen Thinwool Long Johns provide extra warmth for spring and summer ascents and they will be just as good at the cabin. They are a lighter alternative to the Bergtagen wool- terry base-layers, optimised for comfort and performance in fine Merino wool jersey knit. Perfect for all kinds of mountain missions with varying levels of activity. <br><br>The thermo-regulating and moisture-wicking properties of wool make them a great first layer in both warm and cold conditions, and they\u2019ll be especially useful on multi-day trips as wool naturally resists bad odours. Designed for action, they provi- de plenty of freedom of movement, and have elastic at the waist for comfort and fit. The Merino wool used in Bergtagen base-layers is mulesing-free and traceable back to its farm of origin.",
