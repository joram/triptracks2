  "description": "Engineered for precision, the Black Diamond Technician is ultralight, super sticky, and durable, making it the clutch scrambling approach shoe. Featuring our signature EnduroKnit breathable upper, the Technician has superior temperature control, while remaining durable for abuse on the rocks. The lightweight half-bootie tongue allows for easy on and off at the crag, and a TPU midfoot strap and lace lock adds security while the graduated lace system goes all the way to the toe for a lockdown fit. <br><br>The Technician\u2019s tuned EVA midsole consists of a strategic stiff ness-to-comfort ratio, allowing for high-performance precision where you need it, and comfort in just the right spots. The last is ideal for technical climbing, as the name implies, and the shoe\u2019s Black Diamond BlackLabel-Mountain rubber provides super sticky, ultimate grip on terrain that demands precise edging and smearing you can trust your life to. Finally, the Technician\u2019s multiple webbing loops off er various tagging and stowing options for when the approach ends and the hard climbing begins.",
