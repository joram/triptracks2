  "description": "Proven functionality with sustainable cooling: With Beta-Spun technology, Ortovox's popular 150 Merino Cool line now enjoys even more stability. The 150 Merino Cool shirts and tops are now stronger and more robust \u2013 without having to sacrifice the cooling effect of Tencel. Beta-Spun technology from the Sudwolle Group refers to a new spinning process in which a generous number of fine polyamide filaments are spun around a core of merino wool and Tencel. <br><br>The material is more scuff- and tear-resistant thanks to the protective polyamide outer layer, while maintaining the benefits of natural merino and Tencel fibers. The shirts and tops in the line are therefore the perfect companions for all ski and high alpine tours.",
