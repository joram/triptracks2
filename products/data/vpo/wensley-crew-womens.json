  "description": "There are layers, and then there's the Wensley Crew. This waffle-knit base layer features a wool blend fabric on the exterior, while the interior recycled polyester yarn is moisture-wicking and feels cozy on the skin. It's stretchy too, which makes it the perfect layer for those active days where you need your gear to move with you.",
