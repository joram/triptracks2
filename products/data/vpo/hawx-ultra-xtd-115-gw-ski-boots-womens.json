  "description": "The Atomic Hawx Ultra XTD 115 W GW boot is an all-mountain skiing and freeride touring powerhouse. The hard-flexing, narrow 98mm last is constructed with next-generation Prolite, which starts with the slimmest profile possible and then adds reinforcement to key areas to create a super robust boot that is 25% more stable for supremely powerful skiing. Heat-moldable Memory Fit forms the shell and the special Mimic liner molds to the exact shape of your foot. The Adaptive Fit System (AFS) Tongue can be repositioned to accommodate different foot shapes and instep heights while the Adaptive Fit System (AFS) Cuff features a removeable cuff spoiler that increases the amount of tulip-shape and volume inside the cuff. A cuff with 54\u00ba of epic natural movement provides for easy walking and more comfort when standing upright. The highly adaptive GripWalk Sole is compatible with all GripWalk, MN, MNC and Pin bindings. For the experienced mountain lover, the Hawx Ultra XTD 115 W GW offers uncompromised exploration in whatever terrain they find themselves in.",
