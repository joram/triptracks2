  "description": "You can only scope your line if you can see where you're going. Putting on the Smith I/O MAG XL goggles is like flipping the switch from regular to extra-widescreen. Our ChromaPop\u2122 lens tech boosts color and contrast, so you get the clearest picture of the terrain ahead. Our highest level of anti-fog treatment and air flow keep the view sharp. Whether the day dawns clear or stormy, lens swaps are a snap thanks to our quick-swap MAG lens system. Because no two faces are the same, the XL model expands on the standard size for those looking for the largest possible lens.",
