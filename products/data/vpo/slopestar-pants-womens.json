  "description": "The Women\u2019s Slopestar Ski Pants are cut with a modern silhouette and built for riding the resort. A waterproof and breathable shell keeps you dry while sitting on wet chairlifts or in the snow strapping into your board before you drop in, and lightweight PrimaLoft\u00ae Black Insulation ECO makes sure you stay warm while cruising down the mountain. Smart extras like zippered leg vents help you cool off if the day warms up while internal gaiters keep snow out if you\u2019re searching for pow in the trees, or falling a lot is on the agenda when you're learning to ski or snowboard. .",
