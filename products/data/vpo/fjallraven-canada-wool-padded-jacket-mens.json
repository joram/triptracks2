  "description": "The Canada Wool Padded Jacket is a comfortable mid-layer jacket that lets you stay a little longer by the campfire. Made from a soft wool flannel in a classic lumberjack-style, with shoulders and pocket flaps reinforced with G-1000 Eco for extra strength, the jacket doesn\u2019t just look great; it also features noteworthy sustainability credentials. The jacket is filled not with down, or fossil-fuel based synthetic insultation, but natural wool padding. <br><br>The wool is carefully selected surplus wool from a farm on the Swedish island of Gotland. Otherwise discarded, Fj\u00e4llr\u00e4ven\u2019s recovered wool is repurposed as insulation. It harnesses wool\u2019s innate properties of offering warmth, even when damp, and the ability to help you regulate your temperature by wicking away moisture. It\u2019s also naturally resistant to odours and dirt.",
