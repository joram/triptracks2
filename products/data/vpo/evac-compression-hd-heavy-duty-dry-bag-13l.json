  "description": "Perfect dry compression storage for everything from kayaks, motorbikes, roof racks and beyond. Made from a super-strong, abrasion and puncture-resistant 420D waterproof main body fabric and a 500D Cordura eVent\u00ae waterproof but air-permeable base that allows you to push air out while still keeping your contents dry inside. This means no need for a purge valve, making the Evac Compression Dry Bag HD simple to use, even in challenging conditions. Four compression straps make it easy to evenly compress soft items, lash points provide reliable attachment points, and the hypalon non-wicking roll-top closure also keeps the water out. Simple, extremely rugged and reliable- the epitome of durability, versatility, and dry compression.",
