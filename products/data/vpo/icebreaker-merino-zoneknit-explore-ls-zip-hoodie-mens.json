  "description": "The ZoneKnit\u2122 Explore Long Sleeve Zip Hoodie is a highly technical merino fleece midlayer designed with icebreaker's ZoneKnit\u2122 body-mapped technology. Strategically placed panels of insulation and eyelet mesh offer the ideal balance of warmth and thermoregulation for fast-paced, cold-weather adventures. The articulated fit and raglan sleeve construction improve range of motion, and the fitted hood features a high neck and offset zipper for added protection and reduced friction. <br><br>Inspired by nature, icebreaker harnesses the performance qualities of natural fibres to offer an alternative to clothing based on petrochemical synthetics. Merino is an annually renewable fibre that naturally resists odours, keeps you cool when it\u2019s hot and warm when it\u2019s not, and lets your skin breathe for comfort all day, every day.",
