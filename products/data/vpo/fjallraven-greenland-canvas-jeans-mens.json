  "description": "Inspired by an irresistible heavy-duty canvas fabric, the Fj\u00e4llr\u00e4ven design team has created the pair of trousers that they\u2019d like to live in themselves. Greenland Canvas Jeans are a timeless five-pocket model with articulated knees that give great freedom of movement despite their relatively narrow fit. The long-fibred cotton gives robustness and longevity \u2013 these are trousers that will just get better and better the more you wear them.",
