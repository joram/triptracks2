  "description": "This lightweight, breathable, packable vest provides critical core protection that'll keep you warm, fend off the wind, and repel light moisture during high-output activities. Elastic binding at the arm openings and hem comfortably seal in warmth when you need it, and it packs into the internal drop pocket (with a built-in carabiner clip loop) when you don't.",
