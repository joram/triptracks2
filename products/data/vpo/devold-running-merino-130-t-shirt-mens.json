  "description": "Devold\u00ae Running is the ultimate range of training garments, whatever the impact level. These fast-drying, super lightweight and breathable products are made from Merino wool in combination with TENCEL\u2122. TENCEL\u2122 has a skin-cooling effect and both absorbs and wicks away moisture quickly. The material is also durable, lightweight and elastic. With moisture-wicking rib-knit material and strategically placed mesh panels, the products offer optimum comfort and good breathability from start to finish. Ergonomically correct design and seams placed with minimum friction give excellent freedom of movement and comfort. With a soft surface and wool's natural odour-suppressing properties, this is the perfect choice for both active athletes and everyday training.",
