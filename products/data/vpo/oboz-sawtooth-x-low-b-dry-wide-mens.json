  "description": "The Sawtooth X Low Waterproof has all the bells and whistles of the non-waterproof version, but with the added benefit of Oboz's B-DRY waterproof and breathable technology. While the new Sawtooth X has refined styling, it retains the Cordura vents that help promote breathability and make it recognizably a Sawtooth. But your feet will recognize it as a Sawtooth first and foremost.",
