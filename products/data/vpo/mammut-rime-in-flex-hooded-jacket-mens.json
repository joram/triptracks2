  "description": "When temperatures drop, the Rime Flex Jacket with helmet-compatible hood is the right option in cold and wet conditions. The Rime Flex is the warmest synthetic fiber insulting jacket in their collection and features a special, sustainably produced synthetic filling: a combination of recycled polyester fibers and Sorona\u2122 fibers from renewable plant materials. Its special structure keeps you warm and also has elastic properties. Stretch fibers and a slightly lower insulation density on the arms ensure that you can move freely. Thanks to the synthetic fiber filling, the jacket still keeps you warm when it gets wet. The nylon fabric outer shell is very hard-wearing at minimal weight and offers light weather protection. The Pertex\u00ae Quantum Air lining makes the jacket particularly breathable, extremely light and compressible. You can wear the jacket as an outer layer in cold conditions or carry it in your backpack, ready to warm you up during rest stops.",
