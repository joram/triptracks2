  "description": "The compression effect of Ortovox's Alpinist Pro Compression Mid Sock is Distributed equally from the ankle to the calf. This construction supports the muscles and protects against fatigue. During ascent, but also during descent, their calf muscles have to absorb numerous knocks and vibrations. The muscles are placed under continuous stress and can quickly fatigue. Balanced compression can slow this effect.",
