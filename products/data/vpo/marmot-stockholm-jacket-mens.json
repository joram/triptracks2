  "description": "Big baffle energy is in full force with the timeless vintage styling of the Stockholm Jacket. Stuffed with 700-fill down, this everyday puffer is super lofty and surprisingly lightweight, so you won't be weighed down chasing the midtown train or hustling to work on Monday after a long weekend of first chairs, last calls\u2014or both. While the larger than life comfort and heritage style are obvious, it's the small details that make this jacket a daily winter go-to: drawcord hem, adjustable hood cinches, oversized hand pockets, and internal zippered pocket are just what you need in a throw-over-anything winter jacket.",
