  "description": "Durable and versatile outdoor trousers that are just as suitable for mountain trekking as for forest hikes. Made from wind and water resistant G-1000 Silent that has a lightly brushed surface. The fit is regular with a mid waist, and this Pro model has a new, well-thought-through cut that sits better and gives more freedom of movement \u2013 even with its slightly narrower legs. The knees and rear are pre-shaped and the waist is slightly higher at the back to sit well when wearing a backpack. There are two leg pockets, one with a zipper and one with buttons, the latter also has an inside mesh pocket for a mobile phone. There are two hand pockets and two back pockets with flaps. The leg endings are raw length and can easily be adjusted to fit any height perfectly.",
