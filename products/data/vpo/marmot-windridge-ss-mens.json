  "description": "The summer heat has finally met its match with the quick-drying, sweat-wicking, UPF 50 Windridge polyester blend shirt. Going the extra mile is no longer out of reach when summer temps are spiking thanks to the lightweight breathability of the Windridge. Whether you're training for your first marathon or 26 miles is your daily thru-hiking goal on the trail, you'll stay comfortably cool and protected for extended hours under the sun. This shirt also shines when and where the sun doesn't, from the indoor climbing gym to running in the rain when you're caught without a shell.",
