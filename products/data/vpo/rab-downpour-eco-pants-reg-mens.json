  "description": "The Downpour Eco Pant is next-generation of lower impact waterproof gear for walkers and hikerswho love to explore. Built from 100% recycled 2.5-layer Pertex\u00ae Revolve fabric with a fluorocarbon-free DWR treatment, the Downpour Eco pants are monoploymer waterproof shells. It uses a polyester outer and membrane, which means that, in addition to being 100% recycled, it also has the potential to be recycled at the end of its life more easily than gear made from multiple polymer layers.<br><br>They have a variety of practical features, including a low-bulk elasticated waistband and knee-length zips so you can pull them on over walking boots when the weather takes a turn. Soft, lightweight and user-friendly, they're the ideal packable solution for weekend ramblers and seasoned hikers in mild but changeable conditions.",
