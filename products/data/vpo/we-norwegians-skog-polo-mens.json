  "description": "The Skog product line is made of a Merino/Tencel yarn, knitted in a single jersey quality. TENCEL is branded lyocell and modal fiber that is produced by environmentally responsible processes from the sustainably sourced natural raw material wood. Mixed with fine Merino, it makes the fiber stronger, while maintaining the breathability of wool. The Skog Polo shirt is a great staple for your wardrobe, all year. It`s an elegant, understated piece with a hidden buttoning tab and fake chest pocket, as a nice detail. Just enough design elements to still keep it clean and sharp.",
