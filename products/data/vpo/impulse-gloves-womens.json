Featuring a GORE-TEX\u00ae insert and PrimaLoft\u00ae Gold Cross Core insulation, the Impulse Gloves will keep you warm during storm laps and deep days without sacrificing dexterity and supple feel thanks to a durable goat leather construction with reinforced patches in high-wear areas. EVA padding on the back of hand and thumb add protection and our sleek and warm neoprene cuff wraps it up for a snug fit when charging.",
