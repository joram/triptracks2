  "description": "The Monashee 5-Panel Winter Hat sheds snow and keeps you dry on the snowiest days thanks to its high-performance DWR finish. We use breathable softshell material with a fleece backer to provide all-day comfort; keeping you warm enough on those cold, early morning start without overheating on the skin track. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When you get to the top, our flexible brim makes it easy to pack away or stuff in a jacket pocket (although the fitted design works great under helmets too). After a busy day in the mountains, our laid- back styling works well with sharing stories at the bar, even keeping you warm on the walk back home before you do it all again the next day! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Manufactured in Canada, shortening their supply chain and reducing their environmental impact.",
