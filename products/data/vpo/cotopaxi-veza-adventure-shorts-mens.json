  "description": "An ultra-comfortable short to wear anytime and anywhere, the Veza is just as suited for impromptu hikes as it is for impromptu, jet lag naps. Comfy but with a polished design, these bottoms feature an encased elastic waistband, slip-in hand pockets, and an invisible zipper stash pocket for on-the-fly functionality. The Veza\u2019s nylon/spandex fabric blend makes for a sturdy but mobile short you\u2019ll want to wear everywhere, even if you\u2019re keeping it close to home.",
