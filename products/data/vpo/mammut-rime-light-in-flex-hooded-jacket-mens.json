  "description": "The Rime Light Flex is an exceptionally lightweight, versatile insulating jacket with synthetic fiber insulation. When ski touring, hiking, mountain climbing or skiing, it fits snugly to the body thanks to its stretch insulation and side inserts made from elastic Polartec\u00ae Power Grid\u2122 fleece, so that you can combine it with other items using the layer principle. The Pertex\u00ae Quantum Air lining makes the jacket wind-repellent as well as particularly breathable, extremely light and compressible. When you don\u2019t need the jacket, you can easily stow it away in the side pocket \u2013  the Rime Light Flex can go with you everywhere.",
