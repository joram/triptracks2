  "description": "A hardwearing, warm freeride glove all in leather. This 3-finger design long popular with Japanese snowboarders has now made its way across the ocean to a wider audience. The removable liner with synthetic insulation keeps hands warm while an adjustable neoprene cuff comfortably encases the wrist. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whether you prefer skis or a snowboard, you\u2019ll love this sound freeride glove for its durability and sensitivity. The Topo 3 Finger is sewn entirely in treated cowhide* to protect against the elements and provide grip, while also being hardwearing and supple. The 3-finger design means a bit more warmth while retaining some freedom of movement \u2013 practical when you need to sort out your equipment, for example.&lt;br&gt;The liner is detachable and easy to take out and dry after a day\u2019s skiing. The microfleece lining is comfortable against the skin, and the synthetic insulation both insulates and wicks away moisture. A neoprene cuff at the inside wrist makes for a comfortable fit and the width is adjusted with Velcro.&lt;br&gt;All in all, the Topo is a hardwearing, warm glove that works equally well in light, cold January powder as it does in varying conditions later in the season. From Japan to all the snow-clad mountains of the world.&lt;br&gt;* Colour 060060 is sewn in chrome-free treated goatskin. * Colour 700701 has a backhand in chrome-free, undyed Ecocuir cowhide.",
