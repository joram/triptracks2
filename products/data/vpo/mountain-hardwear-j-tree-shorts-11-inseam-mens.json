  "description": "Finally, a pair of shorts that straddles that line between climb and post-climb. If you've been stuck with constricting jean cut-offs or bulky cargo shorts for too long, you know the struggle. Sure, they do the job for a little while, but eventually you'll switch out of dirtbag mode and they'll end up back in your bag with your harness. Not the J Tree\u2122 Short. It's capable enough for your craziest beta and worthy of the celebration.",
