  "description": "<p>On long days spent climbing, we need lightweight material that we can rely on. The Fleece Light Grid line for men is tailored to the needs of mountaineers who require good ventilation and scuff protection but minimum weight. <br><br>Thanks to the channel structure on the inside, our Fleece Light Grid Hoody is particularly light while offering plenty of insulation in chilly temperatures. The fine Tasmanian merino wool lining is very comfortable and will regulate moisture and temperature.</p>",
