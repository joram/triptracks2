  "description": "For limitless freedom when freeriding: The 3L Ravine Shell Jacket has its big moment when it comes to steep powder descents and scrambling in narrow gullies. The jacket is so lightweight, can be packed up so small, and is so minimalistic, that even in a small backpack it takes up very little space during an ascent. A loose cut guarantees maximum freedom of movement and a casual look. In bad weather, the wind and waterproof merino deep shell material with the high-performance Dermizax\u00ae NX membrane provides breathable, dry comfort. <br><br>Long zippers under the arms provide additional ventilation during sweat-inducing passages. To prevent cold wind getting in the way of enjoying the powder, the storm hood can be adjusted horizontally and vertically in a single motion and the soft hook and loop fasteners on the sleeves provide an optimal, gap-free fit. The 3L Ravine Shell Jacket is Climate-Neutral and PFC-Free. Giving the green light for environmentally aware freeriders!",
