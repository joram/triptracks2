  "description": "Arctic cold. Icy winds. Steep snow. And that's just basecamp. When your adventures start with all of the above, you need gear that\u2019s just as epic\u2014and more. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve completely reinvented our 8000M Suit with our patent-pending WarmCube\u2122 technology. 800-fill-power-goose-down and Pertex Quantum\u00ae fabric combine to provide superior wind protection and warmth for summit bid-worthy adventures. Protected by a water-resistant layer of overlapping baffles, the removable liner features 3D WarmCube\u2122 construction that prevents down fill from being displaced and traps heat in the surrounding channels so you stay warm through extreme weather conditions. Adjustable suspenders with a mesh back panel and front detach system customize your fit and improve airflow. The attached hood with insulated muffs offers maximum coverage with an adjustable drawcord at the back that won't interfere with a helmet.",
