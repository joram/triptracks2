  "description": "The Fleece Vest for men is an all-rounder with high functionality, great freedom of movement and natural climate control for cold winter days on the mountain.<br><br>A special knitting process gives the tried-and-tested fleece vest a matt finish that emphasizes its simple, sporty look. The high-quality materials are also super sustainable: The hoody features a unique blend of soft merino wool on the inside and recycled polyester on the outside, making it particularly durable and breathable.<br><br>Since Merino Fleece is extremely elastic, the Fleece Vest for men adapts to fit the body perfectly while also offering maximum freedom of movement. Soft merino wool feels pleasant on the skin and ensures comfortable climate control by naturally regulating both moisture and temperature.<br><br>Two side pockets with traditional loden from the company Steiner keep your hands nice and warm, providing plenty of space for those small essentials you need within easy reach. A special processing technique is used to ensure that the thumb loops form a perfect closure, so that even here no warmth is lost. Their Fleece Vest for men is thus ready for all your winter activities on the mountains and in the valleys.",
