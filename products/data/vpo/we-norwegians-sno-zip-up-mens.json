  "description": "They have finally launched their Scandinavian Luxury base-layers. They have used their favorite yarn from S\u00fcdwolle, the Nm 1/60, 98% super fine merino wool, 17,5 microns, and added 2% Creora-Eco-Soft to make the fabric stretchy. The single jersey also makes the fabric light and breathable, it almost feels like a second layer of skin. This zipped long sleeve has a fitted shape with flatlock seams for maximum comfort, and the merino wool ensures that it stays odor free much longer than your polyester base layers. All of their SN\u00d8 pieces comes in a box that they have tried to keep as simple and minimalistic as possible, so that you can use it as a small storage box.",
