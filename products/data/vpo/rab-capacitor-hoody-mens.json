  "description": "<p>With midweight fleece and Thermic\u2122 stretch side panels, our new Capacitor Hoody is a warm, fast-wicking midlayer to keep you comfortable on active days in the mountains.<br><br>The Capacitor Hoody is built from 100% recycled brushed fleece and lighter Thermic\u2122 stretch side panels for a trim, athletic fit and flexibility during arduous climbs. Designed as a modern take on the classic 200-weight fleece, it provides the optimal balance between warmth and breathability for mixed mountain sport, alongside a fresher, lower-profile aesthetic for more casual everyday use. The Thermic\u2122 stretch fleece panels in the sides, sleeves and hood improve mobility and create a much sleeker, more athletic fit for easier, more comfortable layering between a fast-wicking base and a waterproof shell.<br><br>With a full-length front zip, zipped hand pockets, a secure chest pocket and a helmet-compatible hood, the new Capacitor Hoody is ideal either as a standalone piece or as a winter midlayer for high-tempo hill work.</p>",
