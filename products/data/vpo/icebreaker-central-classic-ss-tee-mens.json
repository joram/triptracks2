  "description": "The Central Classic Short Sleeve Tee is an ultra-comfy everyday tee made from a blend of soft organically grown cotton and breathable, odour-resistant merino wool. Forward set shoulder seams reduce friction when you\u2019re wearing a pack. <br><br>Inspired by nature, Icebreaker harnesses the performance qualities of natural fibres to offer an alternative to clothing based on petrochemical synthetics. Merino is an annually renewable fibre that naturally resists odours, keeps you cool when it\u2019s hot and warm when it\u2019s not, and lets your skin breathe for comfort all day, every day. <br>",
