  "description": "The 150 Cool Mountain Face T-Shirt for men is ideal for long, intense spring ski tours thanks to its durable yarn and the naturally cooling effect of the Tencel Lyocell fibers.<br><br>Beta-Spun technology gives our shirt the required stability: This protective polyamide sheathing makes the fabric more scuff and tear resistant. Fine merino fibers simultaneously offer unique comfort and provide an optimum body climate, while the smooth surface of Tencel fibers ensures great evaporative coolness when things get hot. <br><br>With its sporty cut, cool colors and understated print, the 150 Cool Mountain Face T-Shirt for men always looks great too.",
