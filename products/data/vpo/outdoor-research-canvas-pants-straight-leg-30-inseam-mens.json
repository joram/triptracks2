The Men's Canvas Pant utilizes a cotton/nylon blend with a touch of stretchy spandex to mirror your movements while complementing drop-knee and high-step moves on your favorite boulder problem.

Multiple drop-in and zippered pockets keep your essential items close and easily accessible. Built with climbing in mind from a durable cotton/nylon blend fabric, these stretchy shorts are fit for the most challenging climbs\u2014and just as suitable as an everyday staple.",
