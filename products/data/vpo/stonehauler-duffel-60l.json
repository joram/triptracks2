  "description": "At 60-liters, this StoneHauler is engineered to carry your gear on multi-day adventures, from week-long sieges at your favorite crag, to a sight-seeing trip abroad. The StoneHauler 60L features shoulder straps that are adjustable, and our side-to-side padded body construction which is unique to their StoneHauler duffels and consists of 5mm closed cell foam for puncture and fabric abrasion resistance while carrying gear such as quickdraws, trekking poles, or a rack of cams. This side-to-side body construction aligns with our innovative LockOff internal compression system to securely lock down your gear and make loads easier to manage while transporting. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Black Diamonds DirtBag storage system gives you an integrated way to stow your laundry, and cinches closed with an alpine skirt closure. While traveling, you can safely strap this duffel to a vehicle or mule with the Haul-Loop carry system; a continuous, bomber tubular webbing loop that wraps the entire duffel and is tested to 2kN by the same machines that test their carabiners and Camalots. Two interior zipper pockets and one exterior zipper pocket allows you to keep valuables organized, and the mono-mesh ID pocket gives it your stamp while on the move. The StoneHauler 60L is &lt;br&gt;built with 100% recycled material.",
