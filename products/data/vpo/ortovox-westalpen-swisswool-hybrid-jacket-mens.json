  "description": "Swiss virgin wool meets tasmanian lightness: the westalpen swisswool hybrid high-alpine touring jacket for men features a unique combination of swisswool insulation material and merino fleece grid with tasmanian merino wool on the inside. <br><br>The 70 g/m\u00b2 swisswool lining is used anywhere where additional protection and warmth is required. Sustainable swiss virgin wool has been packed in an elastic, breathable and wind-resistant swisswool tec-stretch material. Merino fleece grid has been integrated into this hybrid jacket to complement the lightweight lining and elastic outer material: fleece material provides a great deal of freedom of movement, is comfortable on the skin and boasts good heat retention properties thanks to its channel structure. Tasmanian merino wool on the inside also regulates moisture and temperature levels, is soft on the skin and is naturally odor-neutralizing. A combination of swisswool at the chin and fleece grid material at the neck provides optimum climate control. A backpack-compatible breast pocket provides room for storing trail bars, cell phone or map.",
