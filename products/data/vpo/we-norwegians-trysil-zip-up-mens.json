  "description": "The Trysil sweaters are memories of the old ski heros of the 50's we see in black and white photos. Nostalgic and feel good pieces made with the most beautiful merino/cashmere yarns from Linsieme and knitted in Italy. This classic zip-up sweater is a beautiful piece knitted in a pearl knit structure, with contrast panels on the sleeve. The inside collar is finished witha contrasting color as well. Wear it with the classic knickerbocker or your ski pants for the posh alpine look.",
