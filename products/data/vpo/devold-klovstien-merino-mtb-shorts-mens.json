  "description": "The new Devold Klovstein Mountain Biking series consists of loose fitted, soft, durable, and comfortable garments, made of a Wool-Tencel blend with high elasticity - especially designed for high intensity activities on a bike. The Klovstein Merino shorts are an articulated pair of shorts made from a highly elastic wool-blend fabric, to optimize mobility and freedom of movement, when you are on the bike. The abrasion-area in the seat is reinforced with a highly durable ripstop. The wide waist band fits well around the waist and is equipped with easy one-hand web tighteners,&nbsp; to avoid belt and belt buckles. The hand pockets are horizontally placed with zippers, to follow the body movement while being in activity. The zipped side pocket has room for the mobile phone or other flat items. All pockets have zip-pullers for easy access. The articulated fit and length, avoids the shorts from any conflict with knee pads. All logos are reflective.",
