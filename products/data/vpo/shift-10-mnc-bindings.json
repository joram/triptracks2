  "description": "The Atomic Shift 10 MN is the same binding as its bigger brother \u2013 with slightly lower DIN options. It\u2019s still the world\u2019s first binding with full touring and freeride capability in one. It\u2019s a genuine tech binding for hiking complete with pins. Flick the hike/ride switch to ski mode and it turns into a genuine freeride binding for the way down, compatible with all ISO normed boots on the market \u2013 alpine and touring. No need to compromise when you\u2019re touring or skiing the resort\u2013 either by hiking with a heavy solution like frames or skiing downhill with pins. You get the best for both. And even better, you can also use it for your alpine skiing days with your normal alpine boot. Finally, one binding for everything!",
