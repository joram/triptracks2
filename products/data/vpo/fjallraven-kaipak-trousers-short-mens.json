  "description": "Kaipak Trousers are designed to work just as well on the trail as for everyday use. An articulated fit together with stretch panels at the back yoke, crotch and back of the knees give great freedom of movement. The main fabric is durable G-1000 Eco that can resist wind and brief showers, and that can be treated with Greenland Wax for extra weather protection. Leg endings with strap adjustments and boot hooks.",
