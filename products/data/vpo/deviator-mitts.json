  "description": "The Deviator Mitts are perfect for those who enjoy alpine starts and need extra warmth during active cold weather activities. The XReflex\u2122 insulation system reflects radiant body heat to improve thermal retention, while the goat leather overlays at the palm and fingertips provide durability. The low-profile pull-on loop makes it easy to put the mitts on, even with cold hands. Movement-mirroring stretch compliments the hand's natural articulation and delivers a superior fit. Constructed for active shoulder season and cool weather activities, the Deviator Mitts are built to push the pace in warmth and comfort.",
