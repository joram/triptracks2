  "description": "Skin track, singletrack, alpine crack\u2014for fast-paced pursuits where a hardshell is overkill and a midlayer fleece lacks protection, the Kor AirShell\u2122 Hoody is the ultralight, ultra-packable layer of your dreams. With a redesigned construction for improved fit, this durable yet super-breathable jacket rebuffs light moisture and alpine gusts thanks to its Pertex\u00ae Quantum Air fabric, and stows in its internal pocket. Call it an ultralight softshell or a super breathable wind shirt, but they just call it the do-it-all stretch layer that never leaves Mountain Hardwear's pack.",
