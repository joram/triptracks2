  "description": "The Merino Cable Knit Crewe Sweater combines classic and reliable style with 100% Merino wool for a comfy and essential sweater that's perfect for winter travel and cold, snowy days around town. Featuring an all-over cable knit pattern, this sweater's merino fabric naturally regulates body temperature and resists odours. The double-layer rib neck and rib cuffs provide a soft, classic finish. <br><br>Inspired by nature, icebreaker harnesses the performance qualities of natural fibres to offer an alternative to clothing based on petrochemical synthetics. Merino is an annually renewable fibre that naturally resists odours, keeps you cool when it\u2019s hot and warm when it\u2019s not, and lets your skin breathe for comfort all day, every day.",
