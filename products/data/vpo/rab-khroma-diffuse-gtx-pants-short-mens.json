  "description": "These hardwearing shell ski pants are built with 3-layer GORE-TEX, offering outstanding waterproof protection for your ski mountaineering or touring adventures in the deepest winter. With durable kicker patches and a reinforced hem, they\u2019ll stand up to sharp ski edges and crampons with ease. The pants are articulated through the knees, giving you the wide range of movement you need for launching a complex ascent or negotiating a bumpy powder field.<br><br>The zip and snap closure at the hem provide easy access to your ski boot buckles, and an internal gaiter seals out snow spray. On the climb up, expel heat using the large, zipped thigh vents, while the deep lined waistband keeps you comfortable throughout long mountain missions. Hook and loop waist adjustments, combined with belt loops and brace attachment points, give you the flexibility to achieve the optimal fit for tackling your next ski objective. Perfect for stashing your skins during the descent, the three external pockets include two hand pockets and a useful thigh pocket.",
