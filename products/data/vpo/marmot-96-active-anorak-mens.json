  "description": "They are throwing it back to the 90's with the reimagined Marmot '96 Active Anorak. Recycled stretch fabric and eco-friendly water-repellent finish breathe modern fresh air into this lightweight heritage hoody that feels equally at home shooting the breeze as it does pushing through it. This vintage-inspired windbreaker is as casually stylish as it is functional, with stretchy performance and a retro kangaroo pocket that not only looks cool, but comes in super handy from spring bouldering trips and cool summer hikes to long nights in the city or around the campfire. When you're rocking this reimagined Marmot classic, you're making the double-whammy commitment to maximum coziness and a minimized impact on the world around you.",
