  "description": "Whether you\u2019re in resort or exploring the backcountry, when you\u2019re on the hunt for the perfect line, this hardshell\u2019s got your back. The Haldigrat is light enough for the ascent and burly enough for the descent thanks to a supple, sustainable outer fabric made of durable post-consumer recycled nylon, and a Drytech Pro Technology waterproof membrane. A freeride-inspired long cut offers a laid-back style loaded with features. It features plenty of pockets, a helmet-compatible hood and underarm vents.",
