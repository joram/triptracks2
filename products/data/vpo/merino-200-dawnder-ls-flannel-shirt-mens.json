  "description": "The 200 Dawnder Long Sleeve Flannel Shirt is a warm, soft and breathable woven flannel shirt that naturally resists odours and regulates body temperature thanks to its 100% Merino wool fabric. Forward-set shoulder seams provide a friction-free fit when wearing a pack, and two chest pockets secure small essentials. Corozo buttons provide a natural finish. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Inspired by nature, icebreaker harnesses the performance qualities of natural fibres to offer an alternative to clothing based on petrochemical synthetics. Merino is an annually renewable fibre that naturally resists odours, keeps you cool when it\u2019s hot and warm when it\u2019s not, and lets your skin breathe for comfort all day, every day. &lt;br&gt;",
