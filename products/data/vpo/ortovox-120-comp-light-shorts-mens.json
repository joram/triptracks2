  "description": "Light weight, function and the best merino wool: with their new 120 comp light shorts for men, the naked sheep is ready for new personal bests! To follow their award-winning 230 merino competition, we have developed their 120 merino competition line for high-action sports in both summer and winter. Consisting of a high proportion of merino wool, this line is now even lighter! What makes their 120 comp light shorts for men so special is that they are produced using an almost entirely seamless circular knitting technique, so that different material strengths can be used in different areas. A fine ribbed structure made from 120 g/m\u00b2 merino gives these short, functional underpants elasticity for maximum freedom of movement, while a particularly breathable mesh structure ensures optimum air circulation in the areas of the body that generate the most heat. This body mapping technique, in which different knit structures are used in certain zones, ensures maximum ventilation. What\u2019s more, thanks to their close fit, their 120 comp light shorts for men are very elastic, highly breathable and quick drying, and yet still durable and long lasting. And the gentle merino fibers with a diameter of 16.5 microns feel as comfortable and soft as a second skin. The positive features of the wool fibers come into their own in this light functional underwear, because merino wool is naturally moisture and temperature regulating and neutralizes nasty odors. And it\u2019s all \u201cmade in europe\u201d! Experience pure lightness with their 120 comp light shorts for men! Whether on a ski tour in winter or an alpine tour in summer, the way to your personal top performance is wide open.",
