  "description": "The benchmark against which all others are judged, the 200 Oasis Legless are Icebreaker's ultra-comfortable base layer bottoms that make the perfect foundation for your everyday cold-weather layering system. Made with 100% merino wool jersey fabric that\u2019s breathable, insulating, and odour-resistant, the Oasis features a slim fit and gusseted construction for unrestricted freedom of movement. The short leg eliminates bunching when worn with boots, and the brushed elastic waistband and flatlock seams throughout eliminate chafing.<br><br>Inspired by nature, Icebreaker harnesses the performance qualities of natural fibres to offer an alternative to clothing based on petrochemical synthetics. Merino is an annually renewable fibre that naturally resists odours, keeps you cool when it\u2019s hot and warm when it\u2019s not, and lets your skin breathe for comfort all day, every day. <br>",
