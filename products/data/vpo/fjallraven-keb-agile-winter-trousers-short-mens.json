Slightly roomier than Keb Agile Trousers to allow for thicker base layers underneath. <br><br>The leg endings have a zippered gusset and are compatible with winter hiking boots. Perfect for winter excursions where you need excellent freedom of movement combined with warmth, durability and protection.",
