It has a robust fabric upper to ensure good wear resistance, while the waterproof, breathable GORE-TEX\u00ae Extended Comfort lining will keep you dry and comfortable, whatever adventure you\u2019re planning. <br><br>The unique construction is made over a special last designed to ensure a good fit and the optimal combination of flex and support. This shoe is also engineered with our proprietary 3F system that connects the instep, sole and heel. Inside the shoe is a shock-absorbing EVA midsole for long-lasting rebound and there is a flexible ankle cuff and rubber toe cap for additional protection. Underfoot, the durable outsole guarantees reliable grip thanks to the Pomoca compound rubber and tread pattern with deep lugs and grooves. It has the versatility to cope with a wide range of terrain from mud and grass to rock, ice and snow. <br><br>The climbing lacing allows you to fine-tune right down to the toe for greater precision in technical rocky terrain. Designed in Italy, according to traditional shoemaking expertise, the men\u2019s MTN Trainer Lite is a lighter, 3-season solution for hiking, and faster-paced treks that makes no compromises on water resistance.",
