  "description": "Light weight, function and the best merino wool: with their new 120 Comp light hoody for Men, the naked sheep is ready for new personal bests! To follow their award-winning 230 Merino competition, they have developed their 120 Comp Light Hoody line for high-action sports in both summer and winter.<br><br>Despite having a high proportion of merino wool, this hoody remains particularly lightweight and long-lasting. The highlight is a special knitting process: this hoody has been made using a seamless circular knitting technique in which different knit structures and material strengths are strategically placed. They are perfectly aligned to the parts of the body and their stresses; for example, the necessary ventilation under the arms and in the chest area. The main zones are made from fine 120 g/m\u00b2 merino, and particularly breathable mesh structures are used in spots that get more heated. This close-fitting hood offers comfort in wind and cold, and functions as a lightweight neckwarmer when down. Athletic men will experience pure lightness with the 120 Comp Light Hoody: whether on a ski tour in winter or an alpine tour in summer.",
