  "description": "The Black Diamond Mission LT 2 is the approach shoe you want for mountain adventures that push the barriers in both scale and technical terrain. The Mission LT 2 is constructed with sustainable materials that are incorporated throughout all components, including its highly durable, abrasion-resistant upper. The tongue is lined (with 100% recycled mesh) and gusseted for extra padding and comfort. The Mission LT 2\u2019s highperformance BlackLabel-Mountain rubber is super sticky, allowing you to move through technical terrain with confidence. Plus, the rubber toe protection gives the Mission LT added security. Multiple webbing loops give you plenty of tagging and stowing options when the approach ends, and the hard climbing begins. Laces, collar, and mesh sock lining are made from 100% recycled materials.",
