  "description": "Designed to keep you crushing year-round, their Zone Pants are a technical take on classic climbing denim. Featuring innovative Sorbtek technology, the Zone Pants have in-yarn moisture-wicking fibers that dry three times faster than other fibers. This technology keeps you cool, dry and comfortable during the cragging day. Plus, they've added a touch of stretch for mobility while sending, and the classic 5-pocket design is harness compatible. The fit is slim for climbing.",
