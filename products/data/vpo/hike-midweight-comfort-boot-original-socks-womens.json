  "description": "&lt;p&gt;Boot length sock for all day protection and next-to-skin comfort. Designed to ensure a dry environment for comfortable and healthy feet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A women\u2019s specific fit boot-length sock for day hikers and trekkers who walk all year-round, the Hike Midweight Comfort features all-day protection with next-to-skin comfort. Merino Comfort Fusion Technology creates a soft, fast-drying, durable sock with a close supportive fit around your foot. The super stretch ribbed cuff provides a looser unrestrictive fit around your calf allowing it to be worn up or down. The engineered zonal padding system provides extra support and comfort throughout the foot bed for long comfortable days in the hills. The Flat Toe Seam minimises bulk that could cause irritation in the toe box and the sock is kept securely in place with an engineered Women\u2019s Specific Fit, Elasticated Arch and 3D-shaped heel cup. Built on a structure of Lycra\u00ae and set by our Thermo Fit process ensures the sock returns to its original shape and size after every wash.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Their Hike socks are where our brand story began. The FusionTech fibres and design of Hike provide \u201cAll Day Comfort\u201d, cushioning and wicking for everyone in the great outdoors. Hike is the go-to range for individuals looking for a walking / travel sock that can be worn in all but the hottest or coldest conditions. Whether you are just going for a walk or an all day hike these are the socks for you.&lt;/p&gt;",
