  "description": "Riding the resort all day while the snow cranks? Suit up in the Men's GORE-TEX\u00ae Lightray Pants. Waterproof, breathable GORE-TEX fabric, a PFC-free water-repelling finish, and their 100% seam-taped construction keep you dry no matter how wet and wild it gets on the mountain, from snow covered chairlifts to yard sale wipeouts. PrimaLoft\u00ae Black Insulation ECO delivers lightweight warmth that will replace the need for a mid-layer, making layering easier than ever. These pants even have articulated knees for the telemarkers and CORDURA\u00ae scuff guards to resist abrasions when you're traversing the trees. For added safety, the RECCO\u00ae Avalanche Rescue Reflector bounces back a signal to rescuers.",
