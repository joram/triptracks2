  "description": "Never freeze again! The new Swisswool Hybrid Short Pants keep committed freeriders super warm even on the frostiest winter days and guarantee unlimited powder pleasure. The technical insulated pants can be worn as ski underpants or additionally between ski underwear and a shell on cold days. 60g/m\u00b2 swisswool inserts on the front and back of the thigh provide optimum protection against frost and cold, and are also moisture-regulating and warm even when wet. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elastic inserts made from breathable merino fleece light on the sides, in the crotch area and at the back of the knees ensure optimum freedom of movement and ventilation. Thanks to their thin seam cuffs, the swisswool hybrid short pants can be tucked into ski socks so that there are no cold bridges between the pants and socks, with no pinching or pressure points. An absolute must have for freeriders on cold days!",
