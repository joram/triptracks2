  "description": "This Tamok wool Shirt may be soft and cozy on the outside but has the performance of a technical mid layer. With its durable and warm reprocessed wool fabric, it will make sure low temperatures won\u2019t stand in the way of good lines, and you can even button the collar fully up for some extra protection. It has a classic, yet minimalistic western vibe, with corduroy reinforcements on the elbow and the circular pocket opening on the zipped chest pocket. To keep it comfy and durable, they\u2019ve kept the corduroy theme on the inside of the collar and cuffs as well.",
