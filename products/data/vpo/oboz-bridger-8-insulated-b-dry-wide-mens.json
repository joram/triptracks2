  "description": "This insulated Bridger is slightly shorter than their 10\u201d model for a faster and lighter option. The 8\u201d insulated Bridger features 200g of Freeze Guard Insulation, and is a great option for snowshoeing or winter hikes thanks to its molded heel kick and winterized Granite Peak Outsole.",
