  "description": "The fisherman\u2019s sweater: pull it on, and you can feel its roots. This one leans into tradition, then moves it forward with recycled materials. Merino wool is blended with recycled polyester and durable nylon to create naturally soft, sustainably comfortable yarns. The cable knit is classic, and raglan sleeves and the ribbed collar, hem, and cuffs finish the look.",
