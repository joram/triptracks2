  "description": "The 38mm Heliad is a versatile belt made from the same structured mesh used in our Konseal climbing harnesses. That means it's strong, breathable, and comfortable on adventures on and off the mountain. The low-profile separating buckle releases and secures easily and allows micro-adjustments for a perfect fit, and the captured tail design creates a clean finish and eliminates snag potential.",
