  "description": "From the office to the open road, the men's Bridger Jean is up for anything. Seriously, there's a reason why it's earned hundreds of 5-star reviews. Ready to find out why for yourself?<br><br>It starts with their signature performance stretch denim, which features organic cotton for both comfort and sustainability. Give the fabric a gentle pull and you'll quickly realize why it has \"stretch\" right there in the name. Ever gone camping in jeans before? You can now, if you feel so inclined.<br><br>Plus, it has that 5-pocket styling that's convenient and never goes out of trend, and a modern slim fit that looks good dressed up with a collared shirt and jacket or casual with a basic tee and sneakers. So the only thing left to ask now is: Which of these cool color options are you going to choose?",
