  "description": "These stretchy trail favorites just got even better with an updated design and maximized comfort that will make the decision to wear any other pants on a daily basis a very difficult one. With the foolproof look of office-approved slacks that can hang from the brewery to the crag, the Scree Pants will get heavy use every day of the week, all year round. Don't be fooled by the assimilated everyday belt-loop look, the stretchy, water-repellent durability will go the distance on any hike, climb, or backcountry adventure with a midweight abrasion resistant softshell that's built for comfort on tough terrain. From hopping big rocks to exploring new cities, the Scree Pants shine doing what you love most in the outdoors.",
