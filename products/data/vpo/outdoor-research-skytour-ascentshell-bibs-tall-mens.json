  "description": "The Skytour AscentShell Bibs are versatile, lightweight, and waterproof, perfect for backcountry touring, ski mountaineering, and other high-aerobic activities in cold weather. Constructed with AscentShell technology, an electrospun membrane that is waterproof and windproof while still air-permeable and stretchy, the Skytour AscentShell Bibs are supremely lightweight and breathable. Zippered outer thigh vents provide superior ventilation as adjustable suspenders fine-tune the fit. <br><br>Convenient storage in a right-side top-entry stash pocket or left-side zip bib pocket keeps essentials close, and a full center front zip allows you to dump heat when working hard in the skin track. The Skytour AscentShell Bibs are the perfect gear for those who want the best of both worlds - the breathability of a softshell with the waterproof protection of a hard shell.",
