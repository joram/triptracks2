  "description": "These technical, durable biking pants are the perfect staple to accompany you on dirt tracks or mountain trails, then transition seamlessly to off-bike downtime. Constructed from wind-resistant Matrix\u2122 softshell fabric with high-wear reinforcements, they\u2019re lightweight and breathable yet built to take a beating, and sturdy enough to withstand your most challenging adventures.<br><br>The pants have been designed for optimal on-bike positioning, with articulation through the legs for smooth pedalling and a raised centre back to comfortably cover your hips when riding. The lower legs feature abrasion protection on the drive side, and a zipped ankle gusset, creating a slim, low-bulk profile to reduce drag. Concealed thigh venting zips allow you to ditch heat on punishing stretches, and give access to your Rab cargo short pockets underneath. There\u2019s further stash space in the two zipped hand pockets, positioned for easy access while you\u2019re riding.<br><br>With a fluorocarbon-free DWR, offset inseams to avoid soreness and dual hook and loop waist adjustment for enhanced fit, these pants are as comfortable as they are tough. Featuring a tapered, stylish cut, they work well both on and off the bike.",
