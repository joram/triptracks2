  "description": "They have finally launched their Scandinavian Luxury base-layers in a box! They have used their favorite yarn from S\u00fcdwolle, the Nm 1/60, 100% super fine merino wool, 17,5 microns, and added some Creora-Eco-Soft, to make the fabric stretchy. It's a single jersey that's light and breathable. Feels like a second layer of skin. They have made a pair of briefs that will help you keep warm in cold weather. Perfect for your ski trip and cold ski lifts. All of their SNO pieces comes in a box that they have tried to keep as simple and minimalistic as possible, so that you can use it as a small storage box. Also, these pieces are very nice gifts. Just saying!",
