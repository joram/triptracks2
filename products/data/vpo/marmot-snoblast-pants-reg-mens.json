  "description": "Pull on the Snowblast Pant and hit the slopes. These stretchy ski pants are easy moving if you want to hit the park or the trees, and they\u2019re waterproof and seam taped so wet chairlift seats don't ruin your day. When the gusts pick up and the snow clouds roll through, built-in recycled insulation offer sustainable warmth for long, freezing chairlift rides and idle time spent waiting on your slowpoke crew to catch up. Designed with plenty of zippered pockets so you can stash snacks when you want to skip lunch and ride all day.",
