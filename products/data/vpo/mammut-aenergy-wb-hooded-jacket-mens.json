It is made from the very lightweight and robust Pertex\u00ae Equilibrium material. As well as repelling both wind and water, this material is also breathable and feels good on the skin. The adjustable hood is helmet-compatible and the hem width can be adjusted using a drawstring. Highly elasticated inserts on the inside ensure on optimum fit on the forearms. If you don\u2019t happen to need the jacket, you can pack it up for compact storage in the zipper chest pocket. The Aenergy Windbreaker is so lightweight, practical and compressible you can take it with you on all your mountain adventures.\n<p></p>",
