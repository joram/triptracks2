Made with durable and weather-resistant, four-way stretch fabric that features a looped, twill backer for premium, next-to-skin softness, the Baja\u2019s sleek, movement-focused fit provides form and function in equal doses. A concealed, side seam zip pocket stashes your passport or other valuables, and the recycled polyester and Spandex waistband offers a smooth, next-to-skin fit under a climbing harness or backpack hip belt.",
