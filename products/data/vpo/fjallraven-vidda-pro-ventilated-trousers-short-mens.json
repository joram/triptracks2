  "description": "Durable trekking trousers with technical features, made from wind- and water-resistant G-1000 Eco. The model is based on the  best-selling Vidda Pro but has improved ventilation options and a slimmer fit with stretch fabric in crotch so still has great freedom of movement . The buttoned strap adjustments at the leg endings can be removed and there are numerous practical pockets and details \u2013 such as a knife pocket on the right leg and a loop for an axe on the side of the waist.",
