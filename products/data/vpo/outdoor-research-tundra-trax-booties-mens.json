  "description": "The Tundra Trax Booties keep feet toasty and warm and are perfect for winter camping, lounging at the cabin, driving home from the ski resort, or simply taking the trash to the bin. The 100% recycled Pertex Quantum Eco shell is water-resistant, wind resistant, and breathable. The 200 g/m\u00b2 PrimaLoft Gold insulation with Cross Core technology provides unmatched thermal properties and remains warm even when wet. <br><br>The rubber traction sole prevents slipping on icy surfaces, and the drawcord adjustable cuff keeps the cold air out. A comfortable and warm memory foam insole rounds out this bootie to make it the perfect choice for cold-weather adventures. For slip-on warmth when the temperatures plummet, the Tundra Trax Booties are a seasonal staple.",
