  "description": "The Devold\u00ae Keipen collection is made for all-year-round hiking and especially for those colder days when you need more insulation. The shirt in 100% Merino wool has a felted surface which makes it particularly suitable for transporting heat and providing insulation. It is a perfect mid-layer with a loose fit, and roomy enough for your favourite baselayer to be worn underneath. The double-cuffed sleeves fit comfortably around the wrist, and there is a single chest pocket for your essentials. The Devold\u00ae Keipen pant is a solid all-year-round hiking pant that combines comfort with high insulation. The Ripstop fabric, made from 70% Merino wool, offers high wear resistance in addition to the wool\u2019s natural capabilities. Designed for optimum freedom of movement with design details such as multiple pockets, smart tightening around the ankle and reflective details.",
