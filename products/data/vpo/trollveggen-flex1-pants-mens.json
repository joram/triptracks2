  "description": "Norrona's most advanced and fully featured mountaineering soft shell pants.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These stretchy hiking pants are made for demanding alpine climbing but work perfectly for all-season mountaineering adventures, ranging from trekking to ski touring with lightweight touring boots.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The main fabric is a 199 gr/m2 flex1 softshell fabric, and we use this because it offers great movement, durability, windproofness, high breathability, and effective moisture transportation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The thickness of the fabric is great for all-year use. The pants consist of two flex1 qualities; a 90D 4-way stretch double weave flex1 fabric in recycled nylon. From the thighs to the bottom plus the seat, we\u2019ve used a highly durable 4-way stretch flex1 fabric in recycled nylon for extra protection. Both materials have been treated with PFC-free DWR.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Key features include a Custom-fit waist system with velcro adjustment, two zippered hand warming pockets, two tight pockets with bellows (one with mobile pocket), a 3/4 side zip that provides ventilation from the knee and up, and a gusset from knee and down. The bottom hem has a bootlace hook and eyelets if you want to fasten a cord around the boot to make sure it stays in place. under the boot, if wanted. They are compatible with suspenders, and mountaineering zip-in bib.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The pants have a technical fit with articulated knees to improve mobility during vertical movement. They can be worn over hiking boots and light ski touring boots.",
