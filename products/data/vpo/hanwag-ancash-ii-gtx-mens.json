  "description": "Whether rocky terrain or rooty trails, the Ancash II promotes good stability and balance on demanding tours with a backpack. Its the sturdy upper that makes this possible. Thanks to its GORE-TEX lining, it keeps your feet dry even in mud and rain. Trekking fans with broader feet will appreciate the wide forefoot area. <br><br>Underfoot, the sure-grip Vibram\u00ae sole with its wide, stabilising heel and high rubber rand round things off nicely. <br><br>*** All Hanwag boots are sold under UK sizing - Please see size chart for details/conversion",
