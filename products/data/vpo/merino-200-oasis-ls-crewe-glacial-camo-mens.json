The soft, 100% merino jersey fabric is breathable, stretchy, and odour-resistant, and flatlock seams provide chafe-free comfort. The tee's unique camo print references the fluid pattern found in the reflection of a glacial lake. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Inspired by nature, icebreaker harnesses the performance qualities of natural fibres to offer an alternative to clothing based on petrochemical synthetics. Merino is an annually renewable fibre that naturally resists odours, keeps you cool when it\u2019s hot and warm when it\u2019s not, and lets your skin breathe for comfort all day, every day.",
