  "description": "Devold\u00ae Nibba is a range of mid-layer garments with an excellent warmth-to-weight ratio, made from 100% Merino wool. The collection is developed for hiking at altitudes where the temperature can change rapidly and comprises two unique jackets, a vest and a pant. The soft brushed Merino inside layer has excellent insulation properties, as the fabric provides great space for warm air to circulate close to your body. The new Devold\u00ae Nibba Hiking jacket is designed to follow your body\u2019s movement and the fabric is bias-cut for natural flexibility and stretch. The jacket is designed to be worn on long hikes with a backpack, so there are no side pockets in conflict with your waist belt.",
