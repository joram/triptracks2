  "description": "Named after the same best-selling Astroman fabric of our most popular sun shirts, the Astro Shorts take a technical twist on one of the outdoor's most important apparel essentials. The combo of our Astroman and Krypta fabrics is to thank for making these shorts so lightweight, stretchy, breathable, as well as durable and abrasion-resistant - perfect for those off trail sections that require a bit of bushwhacking, shimmying down scrambles, or snack breaks sitting on sharp rocks. Multiple pockets store your valuables while you're on the go, and a gusseted crotch enhances your ability to run, leap, and lunge.",
