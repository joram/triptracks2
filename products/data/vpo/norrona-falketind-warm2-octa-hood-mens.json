  "description": "This innovative mid-layer is made for all-year mountaineering but works perfectly for general outdoor activities ranging from trekking to ski touring. We use a unique bonded fabric quality as the main material; the Octa liner provides great lightweight insulation and very effective moisture transportation, and the warm2 face fabric ensures good warmth, durability, and wind resistance while still allowing good moisture wicking. <br><br>The warm2 face is a 100% recycled ?ne-knitted recycled polyester which is super soft, wind-resistant and PFC-free DWR treated for extra protection. The liner is a lightweight multichannel Octa construction which is very open and will allow a continuous release of body heat to keep you comfortable during your activities. To optimize the air?ow, the fabric on the back and under the arms is a stretchy recycled polyester fabric that provides excellent moisture transportation and breathability. <br><br>Main features include a beanie-compatible hood, elastic piping around the face, a chest pocket, two hand pockets, and cuffs with thumbholes.The jacket has a technical ?t with a Y-cut and articulated arms for good movement while climbing. A longer cut in the back ensures extra protection. No seams on the shoulders to prevent cha?ng when wearing a backpack.",
