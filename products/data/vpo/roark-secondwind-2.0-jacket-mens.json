  "description": "The ultra lightweight and packable Second Wind jacket was born out of the need for lightweight protection when poor weather rolls in and temperatures drop. The Second Wind is constructed from an ultra lightweight stretch ripstop fabric with a no-shine dry feel and durable water-resistant finish. The fit was shaped to perform on the trail and eliminate any drag on the go. The trimmer fit reduces the chances of snagging on branches and keeping the elments out while also reducing the size of the jacket when packed into the pocket. The durable front YKK VislonTM zipper will never fail and adds ease for taking the jacket on and off while on the move. Reflective elements are graphical and strategically placed for when the trail meets the road. The right shoulder reflective is for when running against traffic and the left back reflective element is for running with traffic. The partially elasticated hood edge, cuff opening and back hem gives secure closure to a relaxed structure so the product lays naturally and doesn\u2019t bunch. The Second Wind is the go-to packable when you are unsure which direction the weather will go.",
