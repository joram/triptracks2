  "description": "The rock jock version of their technical climbing pants, the Technician Alpine Pants are durable, abrasion-resistant, stretch synthetic pants engineered for sending at the crag. Articulated knees and adjustable drawcord hems are climb-specific features for unencumbered movement, while a ladder-lock waist belt lets you dial in the fit. The hand pockets are harness compatible while the zippered thigh pocket stashes topos and on-route essentials. Finally, the reflective logos are added touchpoints for visibility when you\u2019re defying the dark.",
