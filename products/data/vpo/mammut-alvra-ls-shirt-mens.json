  "description": "A classic flannel with a natural twist, this casual button-up is the perfect choice for long walks, easy-going hikes and everyday wear. Made of a super-soft blend of cotton, kapok and lyocell for ultimate comfort, you\u2019ll also appreciate the lightweight, sustainable, and naturally odor-inhibiting qualities of the kapok fibers, created from the non-food fruit crop of kapok trees. Sporting two chest pockets and adjustable cuffs to round it off, the Alvra is the go-to you\u2019ve been waiting for.",
