  "description": "A mountain boot for high alpine challenges in technically demanding terrain with maximum performance and minimal weight. The knitted shaft is elastic and form-fitting - ideal for difficult climbs - and dispenses with seams to reduce pressure points. For extra comfort and fewer blisters, the foot sits extra tight in the heel area. The waterproof and breathable GORE-TEX footwear lining and stiffening midsole provide extreme insulation in freezing temperatures in the high mountains.",
