  "description": "The Albula Hybrid is a versatile, partially insulated vest for hiking, mountaineering and ski touring. It keeps you warm in all the right spots but is breathable at the same time. The stretchy panels of the vest allow you to move freely even with its tighter fit \u2013 making it a perfect thermal layer as well. Environmentally-friendly production was important to&nbsp;Mammut when&nbsp;they designed the Albula Hybrid: outer fabric made of recycled polyester, lining made of recycled polyamide. The Thermore\u00ae Ecodown\u00ae synthetic fiber lining is made from recycled PET bottles and is the vegan, wash-and-wear down alternative with excellent fill power and a high thermal rating in damp conditions. The Albula family: sustainable, functional and sporty.",
