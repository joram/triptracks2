  "description": "The Snowcrew Pants were built for skiers and snowboarders who lap the lifts with their crew until the last run. Mechanical stretch and resort-dialed features deliver performance, warmth, and style, with a 56% recycled shell material and 85% recycled insulation to reduce harm on the environments we love to play in. The Snowcrew Pants have waist adjustment tabs and belt loops so you can customize your fit as your layering strategy changes by the day or the season. Thigh vents make it easy to dump excess heat when you're working up a sweat, and articulated knees let you move, stretch, and squat naturally. Plus, an avalanche beacon clip in your right-hand pocket make these pants versatile enough to push yourself out-of-bounds.",
