  "description": "Classic knitted sweater made from traceable lambswool that has been blended with polyamide for extra durability. Two-toned yarn that gives a melange effect and small neps add extra structure. Perfect for cold autumn days in the forest, where the temperature-regulating properties of wool come in handy, and its timeless style makes it just as suitable for everyday use at home or work.",
