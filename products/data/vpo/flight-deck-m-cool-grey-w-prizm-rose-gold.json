  "description": "One size does not fit all, so Oakley has expanded the popular Flight Deck family with a mid-sized fit. Inspired by the helmet visors of fighter pilots, Flight Deck M maximizes your field of view so you won\u2019t miss a single target of opportunity. It was engineered for seamless compatibility, giving you the flexibility to choose the helmet that fits your style. Designed with Oakley\u2019s Ridgelock Technology, changing lenses is quick and easy while still allowing for a complete lens seal to prevent harsh conditions from penetrating into your goggle.",
