  "description": "Designed with the Arc\u2019teryx focus on performance, detail and craftsmanship, and styled for mountain town or city, the Levon is a versatile five-pocket pant for relaxed work days, adventure travel and casual weekends. The midweight cotton/nylon stretch canvas is comfortable, hardwearing and stretches for a clean fit that moves with the body. A gusseted crotch and subtle articulation at the knees elevate freedom of movement, and an eco-friendly DWR treatment adds water and stain resistance.",
