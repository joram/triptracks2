  "description": "The Backcountry Marty Hoody is made for staying comfortable in the mountains, just like our furry alpine loving friend, the marmot. This hoody goes on first thing in the morning for a dog walk, coffee run, or a stoke of last night's campfire, and it's the last thing you take off, if you take it off at all, before you hit the hay or the side zips on the sleeping bag. The softness of a midweight blend of cotton and recycled polyester pairs well with a cup of joe, or a campfire nightcap. It's the sweatshirt that's never more than an arm's length away, from the crag, to the couch, to the trunk of your car, at the ready to warm you up or comfort your cool down.",
