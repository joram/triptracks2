  "description": "Hiking to a hidden lake or taking the crew to the local crag? Pull on the Men's Mountain Active Pant. Lightweight yet hard-wearing, these pants have stretch performance fabric, articulated knees, and a gusseted crotch for making moves on or off the wall. A waterproof coating helps you stay dry in a pinch. The adjustable belt and hem cinch help dial in your fit, and zippered pockets make it easy to stash small gear.",
