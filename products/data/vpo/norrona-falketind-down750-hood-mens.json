The face fabric is recycled 20D nylon with PFC free water repellency, and the down is traceable and RDS certified.This jacket works perfectly as an outer layer on cold summer days as well as mid-layer during the winter. To prevent heat-loss in moist conditions, the sides, neck and lower arms have synthetic insulating. The down is distributed in a t-shirt shape to ensure great warming properties where it is most needed. The shoulder piece is made of a combination of down and synthetic material to ensure durability in this exposed area. The shoulders and sleeves are reinforced in a 45D recycled nylon for long lasting durability.",
