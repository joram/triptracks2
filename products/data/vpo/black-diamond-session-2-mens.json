  "description": "Engineered to send in style, the Black Diamond Session 2 combines ultimate comfort and performance with sustainable materials utilized throughout. You\u2019ll first notice how the shoe slips on thanks to the stretch-fit heel for easy on/off transitions. That heel also folds down with ease for slip on functionality. The tuned EVA midsole keeps you cushioned and stable, while the Black Diamond BlackLabel-Street sticky rubber adds grip for approaches or commutes. Webbing loops (25% recycled materials) provide tagging or stowing options for trails that end at the cliff. Finally, the lining and footbed are constructed with 100% recycled mesh.",
