  "description": "The newest member of the YETI\u00ae Hopper\u00ae Soft Cooler family is here with the tough-as-nails Hopper\u00ae M15. Made with their durable MagShield Access, the extra-wide mouth top stays open when needed, making it easier than ever to load and unload food and drink for weekend excursions. Equipped with a strip of durable and powerful ultra-strong magnets, the top seals tight and locks cold in, while the Quick-Release Buckles add an extra layer of protection. And like the rest of their Hopper\u00ae Soft Coolers, the Hopper\u00ae M15\u2019s built in HitchPoint\u2122 Grid lets you attach accessories like the Rambler\u00ae Bottle Sling and SideKick Dry\u00ae Gear Case for extra utility on the go.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;WARNING: Do not leave your soft cooler open in the presence of children and animals. Entrapment and suffocation can occur.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;WARNING: Hopper\u00ae Soft Coolers are not compatible with dry ice. Use of dry ice will cause airtight vessel to explode.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;WARNING: This product contains magnets. Placing near a pacemaker may cause interference.",
