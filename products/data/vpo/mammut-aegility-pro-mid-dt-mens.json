  "description": "Scrambling blurs the boundaries between hiking, mountaineering and climbing. This was Mammut\u2019s inspiration for developing the Aegility Pro Mid DT. Based on the innovative Mammut 360\u00b0 Fusn Technology, it consists of just four parts, combining direct damping, secure grip and high comfort in a robust and lightweight shoe. The 360\u00b0 knitted seamless sock construction adds flexible comfort, reduces pressure points and contains a Mammut DRYtechnology\u00ae waterproof membrane. The new sole design is close to the ground for enhanced control and features a Mammut rubber compound, ensuring reliable, wrap-around grip. A shoe for fast ascenders.",
