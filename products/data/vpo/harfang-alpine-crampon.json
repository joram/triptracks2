  "description": "This crampon has a chromoly steel front and rear rail. Both rails are equipped with an antibott system. The front rail is asymmetrical to give you maximum performance and balance. True to the Harfang line, the Alpine uses our central main textile strap that connects the front and back rails. The main strap flexible linking system minimizes bulk and offers an incredibly compact option.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Harfang Alpine comes with the compact toe bail, designed to fit all mountain boots with front and rear welts. To make it compatible with ski boots, add the standard toe bail, sold separately. The Harfang Alpine comes with two attachment systems: automatic and semi-automatic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;",
