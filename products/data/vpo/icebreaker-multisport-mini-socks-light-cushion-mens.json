  "description": "The Multisport Light Mini socks are durable, breathable, and odour-resistant socks for versatile outdoor performance. The densely cushioned, quick-drying design has key support zones in the Achilles and instep to keep the sock in place. Reinforcements in the heel and toe increase durability, while the seamless toe reduces bulk and prevents blisters.<br><br>Inspired by nature, Icebreaker harnesses the performance qualities of natural fibres to offer an alternative to clothing based on petrochemical synthetics. Merino is an annually renewable fibre that naturally resists odours, keeps you cool when it\u2019s hot and warm when it\u2019s not, and lets your skin breathe for comfort all day, every day.",
