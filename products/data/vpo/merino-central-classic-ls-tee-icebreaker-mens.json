  "description": "The Central Classic Long Sleeve Tee Icebreaker is a go-to everyday T-shirt that features a jersey blend of natural merino wool and soft organic cotton. Forward-set shoulder seams reduce friction when carrying a pack, and the icebreaker skyline graphic adds a touch of mountain inspiration. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Inspired by nature, icebreaker harnesses the performance qualities of natural fibres to offer an alternative to clothing based on petrochemical synthetics. Merino is an annually renewable fibre that naturally resists odours, keeps you cool when it\u2019s hot and warm when it\u2019s not, and lets your skin breathe for comfort all day, every day.",
