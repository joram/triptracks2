  "description": "For deep laps at the ski area, remote backcountry tours and everything in between, the Black Diamond Spark Mitts combine a highly durable construction with a warm and cozy mitt design. Featuring a super-tough goat leather shell with a BD.dry\u2122 waterproof insert and added EVA padding, the Spark stands up to wet storms, rogue tree branches, and the prolonged abuse of the skiing life. The Spark\u2019s mitt design features internal finger slots for increased dexterity, and a buttery-soft fleece lining and PrimaLoft\u00ae Gold insulation keep your hands toasty and comfortable. The updated Freeride Cuff hook-and-loop wrist closure keeps snow out and makes for a secure fit.",
