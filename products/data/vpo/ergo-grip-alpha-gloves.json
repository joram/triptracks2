  "description": "Proper 5-finger glove for climbing, ski climbing and other winter adventure at high altitudes. Similar to the popular F\u00e4lt Guide Glove \u2013 a long-term favourite among mountain guides and professionals \u2013 but has extra pre-curved fingers for the best grip when handling climbing equipment. Goatskin leather on the palm adds resilience and durability and the merino wool liner can easily be removed to wash or dry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Ergo Grip Alpha has been developed in partnership with mountain guide Alexander Nordvall. This is a hardwearing yet supple work glove for high alpine terrain, sewn in goatskin leather with windproof, breathable stretch fabric on the backhand. The Ergo Grip design with extra pre-curved fingers and overlapping seams provides unbeatable freedom of movement for the hand.&lt;br&gt;The liner is removable and made from merino wool with a terry knit lining that insulates well even when a little damp. Easy to wash and dry, or to swap out for another liner as needs change. The cuff is long and there\u2019s a reinforced grip surface on the palm. An eyelet and finger loop allow you to attach the glove to a rucksack or harness when not in use.",
