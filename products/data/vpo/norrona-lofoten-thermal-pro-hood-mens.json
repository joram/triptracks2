  "description": "This half-zip jacket is made for freeriding but also works for mountaineering, trekking, and general outdoor. It\u2019s made with different Polartec\u00ae fabrics to provide optimal thermal performance and comfort.<br><br>They use the Polartec\u00ae Power Grid\u2122 in the back, stomach area, underarm, and hood because it offers excellent quick-drying and moisture-wicking properties. This patented grid design structure is a way to reduce fabric weight while increasing warmth and compressibility. Open-air channels surrounding each segment of the grid allow easy release of all excess body heat as it builds during activity. <br><br>The shoulders, neck, and top sleeve are made in Polartec\u00ae Thermal Pro\u00ae because of its superb warmth-to-weight ratio. This unique knit technique creates air pockets that trap air and retain body heat, providing outstanding warmth to weight. Not only are they very comfortable, but these fabrics offer excellent breathability, dry quickly, and are very pill-resistant.",
