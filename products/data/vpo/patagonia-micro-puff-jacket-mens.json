  "description": "The Micro Puff\u00ae Jacket combines ultralight Pertex\u00ae Quantum shell fabric with PlumaFill insulation, and the result is the best warmth-to-weight ratio of any jacket we\u2019ve ever created and the highest compressibility of any of our synthetic jackets. It is your go-to insulation piece for mixed (and possibly miserable) cold conditions. The shell fabric is made with NetPlus\u00ae 100% postconsumer recycled nylon ripstop made from recycled fishing nets, and the insulation is 100% recycled polyester. Fair Trade Certified\u2122 sewn.",
