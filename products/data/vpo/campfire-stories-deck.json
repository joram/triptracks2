  "description": "Campfire Stories Deck is a collection of 50 cards with storytelling prompts to help people of all ages find engaging and meaningful ways to connect with family and friends. While the glow of a campfire is the iconic setting for intimate stories, these cards can be used anywhere--on a camping trip, in the backyard, around the dining room table, or even an online hangout--to spark a story. The cadence and authenticity of personal stories can help us reveal ourselves, allay fears, bring comfort, and pass the time. For example, &quot;Tell a story about a time when you left something behind&quot; might lead to a tale about a teddy bear, favorite shirt, well-worn book, or grandmother\u2019s ring. Many of the deck\u2019s prompts look to nature for inspiration: &quot;Tell a story about your first visit to a national park&quot;--or your first time in a tent, first encounter with a wild animal, or favorite beach experience. People dream of their next adventures by reminiscing about past ones, and these cards help bring those memories--and rich stories--to light, whether around a candlelit dinner table or under the stars. Additional cards explain fun ways to use the deck and offer storytelling tips.",
