  "description": "The Photon Wire remains one of the lightest carabiners in the world and is still significantly larger than other carabiners in its class. The newest generation features an updated body design that increases strength and rigidity to handle the odd stresses that climbers put on their gear. We have also redesigned the interface between the gate and nose to help protect the wire gate from damage or accidental opening. Available in eight colors for individually racking cams \u2013 team the sling color with the coordinating carabiner color for the fastest way to identify the right cam size on the sharp end and reorganize the rack at belays. The Photon Wire is perfect for climbers who want a racking carabiner that is lightweight and low-profile but still clips with the ease of a high-end quickdraw. It is particularly well-suited for difficult trad leads or alpine mixed routes and ice climbing where a full-size carabiner is much easier to operate while wearing gloves.",
