  "description": "The Reason 120 is their widest shape, designed for flotation first and foremost, but with plenty of materials science wizardry up its sleeve to excel in many environments. Its medium flex, tighter sidecut, and smooth rocker profile integrate beautifully with their stability-enhancing Algal Core and Algal Wall, creating a buoyant backcountry tool that\u2019s deceptively capable in a wide range of snow conditions.",

      "value": "Progressive - The tail begins with a medium to stiff flex, transitioning to stiffer through the mid section and decreasing gradually toward the tip. This flex pattern creates a solid platform for stability in the tail and underfoot while the medium tip flex handles crud and variable conditions with ease. Because of its girthy nature and inkling for softer snow, the Reason 120\u2019s flex does feel slightly softer than both the Intention and Vital since the flex is dispersed more throughout the wider platform."
