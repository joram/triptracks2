  "description": "You'll find yourself reaching for the Olden Polartec Jacket from chilly late-summer nights all the way through spring ski season. Wear it as stretchy, moisture-wicking outerwear while training for your cold-weather marathon or grab your shell and board and use it as a soft, breathable midlayer for days carving up that fresh powder. Earned yourself an off-day after an epic climbing session at the crag? The Olden Jacket also shines as comfy loungewear when staying in and taking it easy are on the agenda.",
