  "description": "The Hike+ Medium Crew socks are breathable and naturally odour-resistant socks for all-round hiking and backpacking. The fully cushioned, quick-drying design is anatomically sculpted for premium fit and comfort, with key support zones in the ankle, Achilles, and instep. Reinforcements in the heel and toe increase durability, while the seamless toe reduces bulk and prevents blisters.<br><br>Inspired by nature, Icebreaker harnesses the performance qualities of natural fibres to offer an alternative to clothing based on petrochemical synthetics. Merino is an annually renewable fibre that naturally resists odours, keeps you cool when it\u2019s hot and warm when it\u2019s not, and lets your skin breathe for comfort all day, every day.",
