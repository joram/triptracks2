  "description": "Powerful downhill performance meets walkable efficiency in the all-mountain Atomic Hawx Ultra XTD 110 BOA GW, making this medium flex crossover boot the choice for adventurous all-mountain skiers and freeride tourers looking to explore more of the mountain. The BOA\u00ae Fit System Alpine uniformly wraps the shell around the foot to provide a secure foothold for precise skiing performance and an even more comfortable fit. Next-generation Prolite Construction starts with the lightest profile possible and then adds reinforcement to critical energy zones to create a super robust boot that is 25% more stable for supremely powerful skiing. Heat-moldable Memory Fit combined with a Mimic Gold Liner can be uniquely formed to the precise shape of the foot. The cuff offers 54\u00ba of epic natural movement for a more relaxed walking gate and greater comfort when standing. The GripWalk Sole is compatible with all GripWalk, MN, MNC and Pin bindings. Extremely powerful, this low volume, 98mm fit is the ideal boot for those eager to explore beyond their boundaries.&lt;br&gt;",
