  "description": "Norrona's Falketind Warmwool2 stretch Zip Hood is the ultimate all-round, all-year hooded mid-layer. The jacket is highly stretchable, and the main fabric is a recycled polyester and wool mix with excellent thermal properties and good breathability. It offers great moisture transport when you decide to increase your pace and dries up fast when hung up thanks to the polyester. <br><br>The highly durable piece is suitable for everything from everyday strolling at your favorite outdoor destination to hardcore active use. They've given the fabric a resin surface treatment for extra pill resistance and enhanced durability. It has a comfy fit and clean look that will work at whatever, whenever. <br><br>Practical features include a functional hood, two mid mounted pockets which won\u2019t interfere with shoulder straps and hip belt, a chest pocket, comfy cuffs, one-hand adjustable elastic hem and a clean, snug collar. If you\u2019re only investing in one hooded mid-layer for now, they suggest you go for this one.",
