  "description": "For limitless freedom when freeriding: The 3L Ravine Shell Pants have their big moment when it comes to steep powder descents and scrambling in narrow gullies. The pants are so lightweight, can be packed up so small, and is so minimalistic, that even in a small backpack it takes up very little space during an ascent. A loose cut guarantees maximum freedom of movement and a casual look. In bad weather, the wind and waterproof merino deep shell material with the high-performance Dermizax\u00ae NX membrane provides breathable, dry comfort. <br><br>The 3L Ravine Shell Pants are Climate-Neutral and PFC-Free. Giving the green light for environmentally aware freeriders!",
