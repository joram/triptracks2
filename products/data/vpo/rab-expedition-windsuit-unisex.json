  "description": "The Expedition Windsuit is designed as a windproof layer to be used in conjunction with insulation. Perfect for the world\u2019s coldest climates the suit is compatible with our insulated expedition suits, jackets and salopettes, and provides expert weather protection at high altitudes or in polar environments.<br><br>Built with Pertex\u00ae Quantum tightly woven fabric the suit is extremely windproof whilst remaining breathable, lightweight and packable. A DWR finish easily sheds water although this suit is designed for cold environments where it is likely to be very dry.<br><br>It features an adjustable hood with a stiff peak and has been optimised for articulation at the knees to allow for full range of movement on challenging terrain. It has two chest and two Napolean outer pockets, and a two-way extended front zip (ideal for relief in environments where removing gear is almost impossible). Full length side zips with multiple pullers enable you to put it on and take it off with ease.",
