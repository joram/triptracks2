  "description": "Lighter, stronger and faster drying than traditional merino, the ODLO X-Alp Performance Wool 115 trail running t-shirt is a modern, high performance merino that's unlike any other. Crafted from Performance Wool powered by Nuyarn\u00ae - a wool blend that closely mimics wool's natural performance characteristics - this tee is naturally temperature regulating (so it keeps you cool when it's hot and warm when it's cool) and naturally antimicrobial (which cuts down on scents). Sourced from non-mulesed merino wool, the fabric dries 5 times faster and is over 8 times more abrasion resistant than regular merino. Perfect for wearing with running packs or on long runs in the mountains. Features a stylish micro-stripe. Experience running in lightweight, high performance, natural wool. You'll never look back.<br><br>Why they made it: Trail Running, Running",
