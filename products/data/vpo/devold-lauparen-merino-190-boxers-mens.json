  "description": "The Devold\u00ae Lauparen is soft and light clothing knitted in 100% fine merino wool. This quality ensures fantastic insulation capabilities and is incredibly breathable at the same time. In addition to wool, which naturally regulates your body temperature in relation to activity, the Lauparen has strategically placed mesh panels that ensure optimal ventilation properties. The garment has a tight and comfortable fit, as well as flat seams and side panels that provide optimal comfort when carrying a backpack. This is a year-round favourite, perfect for all outdoor activities \u2013 e.g. walking tours.",
