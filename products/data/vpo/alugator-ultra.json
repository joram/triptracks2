  "description": "The Alugator Ultra is one of the lightest aluminum shovels on the market thanks to the latest innovations in design and materials. The first shovel of its kind with welded construction and a blade thickness of just 1mm of aerospace grade 7075 aluminum, the Alugator makes no compromises on weight or performance. Like all our avalanche shovels, this vital piece of equipment is designed specifically to cut through avalanche debris. What sets it apart is its exceptionally light weight. Raising the bar for durable, lightweight performance, the Alugator Ultra features a telescopic shaft for fast assembly, and symmetrical T-grip for optimum transfer of energy when shoveling snow. The space-saving blade design also means the Alugator Ultra fits into a small backpack. In an emergency situation, every second counts, which is why our avalanche equipment meets the highest possible safety standards. All Mammut avalanche shovels are UIAA certified for efficient rescue and durability.",
