  "description": "Inspired by high-tech mountain parkas of the early aughts, the '03 Plasma Parka has returned with the modern updates and retro style it needs to transition from big mountains to big city streets. This throwback 700-fill down jacket is lightweight and full of cozy puff, but it ain't just for good looks and epic warmth. Pertex\u00ae ripstop fabric and added nylon overlays mean this jacket is built even tougher than the snowy summit-bound OG. If it can handle rough alpine terrain, it can easily handle your dog or kids playing a little too rough. Versatility is key when you're traversing the frigid city grid and off the grid, so the zip-off hood will come in handy when you're packing your bag for any winter getaway.",
