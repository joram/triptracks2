The highly breathable and water-resistant outer material is a stretch woven fabric that is wind resistant, and the fingertips feature touchscreen-compatible goat leather. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The gloves also have a 4-way stretch that allows for a full range of motion, and the pull-on loop makes them easy to take on and off. Whether working hard on the nordic track or walking the dog in the evening, the Methow Stride Gloves keep your hands warm and dry while out on the trail.",
