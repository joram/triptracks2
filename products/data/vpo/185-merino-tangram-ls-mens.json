  "description": "Stylish and colorful in the mountains: the 185 merino print line features shortsleeve and longsleeve t-shirts made from 100 % fine merino wool that is verified in accordance with the Ortovox wool promise, and is a naturally functional companion on ski tours and freerides thanks to its temperature- and moisture-regulating properties. Merino wool is comfortably soft on the skin and provides a perfect body-climate. The reason for the high quality and functionality of this fine wool is that the merino sheep enjoy optimum living conditions. In the natural paradise of Tasmania, they benefit from rich pastures, unlimited habitat and a moderate climate.",
