  "description": "The Panza harness is the ONLY dog harness that also converts into a rescue sling, so you can safely carry your dog if they become injured or sick during an outdoor adventure. Add the optional Saddle Dry-Bags, turning it into a backpack, and it becomes a true multipurpose piece of gear. With the Panza harness, you get the best dog harness for everyday use AND the ultimate peace of mind because your dog will never be without a rescue sling in the event of an emergency. No matter if you\u2019re a mile from the trailhead or deep in the woods, you\u2019ll be able to carry your dog to safety.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why you need the Panza harness: Dog injury or illness on the trail is more common than you might realize. Anything can happen \u2014 paw abrasion, sudden fall, puncture wound from a tree branch, wild animal encounter, snake bite or over-heating. In a real emergency, would you be prepared to manage the situation? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Panza harness gives you the ability to self-rescue your canine companion \u2014 and complete confidence to tackle even the most rugged adventures. Always ready to deploy when you need it, \u201cthis harness would have been enormously helpful when our dog Remi became seriously injured\u201d (read the true story that inspired us to create our first rescue sling, the Airlift).",
