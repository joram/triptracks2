  "description": "A wind resistant and breathable hybrid insulation/mid layer.<br><br>This breathable insulation jacket (352g M/L) is made for mountaineering with a mid to high-intensity level. It works great for trail running, ski touring and all kinds of outdoor activities where breathability and warmth when moving is needed.<br><br>We use a light nylon stretch as the face fabric because it provides good breathability and wind protection. We use Polartec\u00ae Alpha\u00ae insulation because we believe it is the world-leading breathable insulation and do not need a lining on the inside. In the hood, part of the sleeve and sides we use Polartec\u00ae Power Grid fleece because of its stretch, warmth to weight and durability.<br><br>The face fabric is a 20D+30D x 20D stretch 55% recycled nylon/ 37% nylon/ 8% polyurethane fabric (62 g/m2). The Polartec\u00ae Alpha\u00ae insulation is a 100% recycled polyester (95 g/m2).
