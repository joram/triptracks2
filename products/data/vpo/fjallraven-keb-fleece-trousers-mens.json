  "description": "Warm, insulating fleece trousers made from a functional wool blend that combines the temperature-regulating properties of wool with the durability of polyester and pliancy of elastane. The outside is smooth for low friction against shell garments, while the brushed inside is soft against the skin. <br><br>Loose enough to wear over a pair of long johns but tight enough to wear under an outer layer. Low-profile adjustable waistband with drawcord and tapered lower legs that fit comfortably under other layers or with boots. The perfect insulating mid layer for all kinds of outdoor activities and great by themselves in the cabin as well.",
