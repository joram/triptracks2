  "description": "A casual short that holds it down around town but can still rally for redpoint attempts and weekends at camp, the J Tree\u2122 Belted Short has both durability and aesthetics worthy of its namesake. The durable cotton ripstop fabric withstands days in the desert and obligatory off-widths, while the articulated fit and gusseted construction allow full range of motion for sunset scrambles.",
