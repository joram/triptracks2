It works well both as an introductory knife for the younger generation as well as for more experienced outdoor enthusiasts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Companion is the perfect knife for an adventure, a real all-round knife. The tang runs three-quarters of the way up the knife, so that you can work with power and precision. The blade is made of stainless steel which makes knife care extra easy. The soft friction grip is made of TPE rubber, making the knife feel secure and steady to work with. The polymer knife sheath includes a practical belt clip so that the knife can be attached to your Backpack or belt - always close at hand.",
