  "description": "The latest addition to the successful Rush family, the Rush Trk GTX dials up the support and protection a notch with a suede leather upper and a rubber toe rand, backed by GORE-TEX\u00ae for guaranteed protection from the elements. The upper balances the light and agile feel of a trail running shoe with the support and protection you expect from a hiking boot. Underfoot support, protection and traction come courtesy of the exclusive PRESA outsole with Interactive Kinetic System (IKS) Technology. <br><br>The IKS system features impact absorbing internal domes placed in key ground contact areas that function as mechanical shock absorbers, while out SuperGum rubber compound provides secure grip on whatever terrain you encounter. The Dynamic Stabilizer Torsion frame supports the arch and wraps the heel on both sides, providing terrific rearfoot stability and torsion control so you can confidently tackle whatever the trail has in store.",
