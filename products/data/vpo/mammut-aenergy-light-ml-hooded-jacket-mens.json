  "description": "<p>Maximum performance combined with minimum weight. The Aenergy Light hooded jacket is designed for mountaineering and ski touring all year round. Depending on the outside temperature and level of exertion, you can wear it as a base or mid layer. It is made from very lightweight Polartec\u00ae Power Grid\u2122 material, which keeps you warm, is elasticated and has a waffle structure on the inside that efficiently wicks moisture to the outside. The hood is close-fitting thanks to an elasticated border and sits perfectly under a helmet. Flat seams reduce unpleasant pressure points and make the jacket feel very comfortable. The Aenergy Light Hooded Jacket: our lightest hooded mid-layer for ambitious mountain sports enthusiasts.</p>",
