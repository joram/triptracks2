  "description": "Honestly, when the Men\u2019s Health 2021 Outdoor Awards tagged our Number 2 sock as their Best Hiking Sock, we were moved. Personally, we think it\u2019s the No. 1 sock when nature calls. Look closely at this hike sock and you\u2019ll see what we mean. Either way, a blown-out seam should be the least of your worries. That\u2019s why the Number 2 is also No. 1 when it comes to long-lasting toughness and active comfort as well.",
