  "description": "The Lofoten Gore-Tex Pants are the lightest and most breathable freeride pants designed for dynamic mountain adventures. <br><br>Developed to achieve a lighter and softer freeride pant with a great weight to durability ratio, these pants are made in a lightweight wind and waterproof recycled Gore-Tex 70D x 160D with a TR2 backer. <br><br>They have key features such as Custom-fit system\u2122 waist adjustment, thigh ventilation from the waist to the knee, thigh pockets for essential gear and reinforcement on the inside of the lower leg. The pants have a technical fit, slightly more narrow than the other lofoten Gore-Tex Pants, but still customized for freeriding. <br><br>The optimized waistline prevents gaps in the front when attaching the pants to a bib or jacket. By having the front zip slightly facing the side, this created a small overlap that will provide a full seal. The bottom leg width that can easily accommodate a ski or snowboard boot in walk mode. <br><br>Other critical features include articulated legs, snap button tightening around the ankles, and integrated snow gaiters. The pants are compatible with all the ski bibs and the snap-in powder skirt on the jackets. <br><br>Inside leg length is 86,5 cm in size L. The length differ 2 cm up/down per size.",
