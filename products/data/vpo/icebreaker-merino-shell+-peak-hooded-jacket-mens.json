  "description": "The Shell+\u2122 Peak Hooded Jacket is an innovative technical shell made with 100% merino wool. The jacket's woven merino fabric features a PFC-free DWR finish to shed wind, snow and light rain, and is seam sealed for added moisture protection. The three-way adjustable storm hood fits with or without a helmet, and the high collar is shaped for comfort and added protection. Articulated sleeves enhance range of motion, and zippered alpine hand pockets and a ski pass pocket keep your essentials secure. <br><br>Inspired by nature, icebreaker harnesses the performance qualities of natural fibres to offer an alternative to clothing based on petrochemical synthetics. Merino is an annually renewable fibre that naturally resists odours, keeps you cool when it\u2019s hot and warm when it\u2019s not, and lets your skin breathe for comfort all day, every day.",
