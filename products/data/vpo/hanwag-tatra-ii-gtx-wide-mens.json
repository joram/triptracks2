  "description": "Roll on the mountains! Whether hut-to-hut treks or day hikes, the Tatra II Wide is a versatile boot that is a pleasure to hike in. Comfort is the name of the game \u2013 from the sure-grip Vibram\u00ae sole tread via the comfortable footbed to the intelligent lacing and soft, leather cuff. The Wide Version has a standard heel, but is wider at the forefoot and ball of the foot. Say goodbye to pressure points. And the GORE-TEX lining keeps your feet dry in wet conditions.<br><br>*** All Hanwag boots are sold under UK sizing - Please see size chart for details/conversion.",
