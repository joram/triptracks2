  "description": "The Circuit 2 is an approach shoe disguised as an everyday sneaker. With an updated, modern pattern and new sustainable materials used in construction, the Circuit 2 is a shoe that feels at home in the boulders, on the street, or at the gym. BlackLabel-Street rubber makes the soles sticky, while a rubber toe cap provides extra protection and security. Webbing storage loops, made from recycled webbing, allow for various tagging and stowing options for when the trail ends, and the climbing begins. Lining and footbed are both made with 100% recycled materials.",
