  "description": "With over one hundred full-color photographs comes a harrowing portrait of Canada\u2019s most devastating wildfire season ever, the effects of which could be felt and seen across the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\u201cAll hell has broken loose.\u201d That\u2019s the phrase some fire officials use to describe the unprecedented 2023 wildfire season in Canada. Never before has the vast and rugged beauty of this country been ravaged by as many devastating wildfires. Never before have the fires been this big or moved this fast. Choking smoke blanketed the continent, including the United States, putting millions of people under air quality advisories, and even traveled as far as Norway.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The wildfire season started in the spring with most provinces and territories facing a drought. In early May, many parts of Canada grappled with a record-breaking number of fires. By the end of August, wildfires had devoured more than 15 million hectares (37 million acres) of Canadian forest\u2014more than six times the average usually lost to fire. Provinces such as British Columbia and Nova Scotia experienced their largest wildfires ever. Quebec, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Northwest Territories battled their most destructive wildfires ever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tens of thousands of Canadians\u2014from coast to coast to coast\u2014were chased from their homes by flames or the threat of flames, seeking shelter in evacuation centers across the country. People from Halifax, Yellowknife, Kelowna, Shuswap, and many other communities survived harrowing escapes along flame-lined roads, with embers raining down upon them. Thousands of firefighters from Canada and around the world risked their lives to battle the blazes, which already numbered almost 6,000 by the end of August. Four firefighters lost their lives doing so.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Summer Canada Burned tells the dramatic story of Canada\u2019s wildfires in 2023\u2014a story that provides a case study of the changing climate and its impacts on our environment. It reflects evolving attitudes about approaches to wildfires and the role all people can play in prevention. Most importantly, however, the story of Canada\u2019s wildfires is a story of loss and of survival. From the ashes, people rise, communities rebuild and seeds of new growth sprout.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A share of the sales from the book will be donated to the Canadian Red Cross.",
