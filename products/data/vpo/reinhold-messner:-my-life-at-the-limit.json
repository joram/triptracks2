  "description": "Reinhold Messner: My Life at the Limit is a conversation between Messner and interviewer Thomas H\u00fcetlin, an award-winning German journalist. It reveals a more thoughtful and conversational Messner, covering not only the highlights of Messner\u2019s climbing career, but also his treks across Tibet, the Gobi, and Antarctica; his five-year-stint as a member of the European Parliament; his encounter with and study of the yeti; his thoughts on traditional male/female roles; and much more. Readers learn about Messner\u2019s childhood, his thoughts about eating ice cream with girls (against), politics (mostly liberal), and his technique for killing chickens (sharp scissors).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Messner is known as one of history\u2019s greatest Himalayan mountaineers, a man who pushed back the frontiers of the possible for a whole generation of climbers. While the interest in My Life at the Limit is that it exposes much more of the man than his climbing career, that career is still utterly remarkable\u2014\u2014and Mountaineers Books is proud to present this book, which is core to our mission, to audiences across North America.",
