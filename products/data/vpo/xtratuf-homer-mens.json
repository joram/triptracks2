  "description": "The Homer is inspired by Alaska commercial fishermen who prefer to step into a lightweight shoe during the down time when they aren't working the decks or when the fish aren't biting.<br><br>The Homer is water resistant with a slipper like feel. It features a soft wool upper with a full faux-shearling lining keeping you warm and cozy, while the molded EVA insole provides added comfort. The classic XTRATUF\u00ae non-marking Chevron outsole delivers great slip resistance in this easy-to-wear step-in shoe.",
