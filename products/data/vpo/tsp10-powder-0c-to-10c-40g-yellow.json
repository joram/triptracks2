  "description": "TSP10 is a great powder in wet conditions, typically when new or transformed snow is turning wet. Despite being somewhat soft powder, the durability is great, and the powder can easily hold up for longer distances. When ironing, take approx. 8-10 sec. to cover your ski base. Important to have a good iron to get an efficient melting of the powder.",
