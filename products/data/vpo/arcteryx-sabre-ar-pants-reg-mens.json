  "description": "Designed for big mountain freeride touring, the Sabre AR Pant is waterproof, breathable and hardwearing. Freeriders require features that handle the rigors of on area descents and off piste exploration, like double side zips that open wide for rapid ventilation. Storm protection and warmth come from the N80p-X Gore-Tex 3L fabric with 3L lo-loft soft shell construction. The material\u2019s brushed liner provides light insulation and a flannel like feel. Durable 100D Cordura\u00ae PowderCuffs\u2122 seal out snow and fit under snowboard highbacks, and Keprotec\u2122 instep patches prevent abrasion and ski cuts. Integrated Slide\u2019n Loc\u2122 attachments link with compatible jackets to creat a unified clothing system that moves with the body and helps seal out snow.",
