  "description": "The black star. The Meta stick is spatial, with a handle carved from rubber that can be shaped to the precision of the touch and a 90 mm basket that allows for adaptation to variations in terrain. To enhance the detail of this increasingly sensual stick, the handle is delicately decorated with chevrons. The Meta can be used for everything, everywhere and is often very colourful.",
