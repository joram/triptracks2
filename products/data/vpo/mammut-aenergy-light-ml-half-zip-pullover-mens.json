  "description": "<p>Their lightest midlayer is the perfect solution for ambitious mountain athletes or anyone who prizes the highest possible performance at the lowest possible weight. Made of Polartec\u00ae Power Grid material, it is comfortable, stretchy, and actively sweat wicking. Flatlock seams prevent chafing, a deep front zipper provides efficient ventilation, and a laminated chest pocket keeps small essentials accessible and secure. Made to accommodate all seasons and a full range of pursuits, this versatile piece is as comfortable as a midlayer on a brisk spring hike as it is as a first layer on a winter ski tour. A sure favorite no matter what you\u2019re up to next.</p>",
