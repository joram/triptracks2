These 3/4-length bottoms are made with 74 per cent recycled polyester and have been collaboratively designed with Protect Our Winters (POW) Switzerland - an NGO committed to climate crisis awareness. They deliver unmatched range of motion, fast drying performance, breathability and insulation in cool weather. Finished with ZeroScent - a bio-based antibacterial treatment that limits odours - Blackcomb layers fit next to skin and are ideal for skiing, ski-touring, cross-country skiing and winter running.
