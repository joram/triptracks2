  "description": "The Lhasa II's wide last, which is more generously dimensioned in the forefoot and ball of the foot, prevents lateral pressure points in the forefoot area on wider feet. Rubber protectors on the toe and heel protect against sharp rocks. The grippy profile of the Vibram\u00ae AW Integral sole has special braking and tread studs for steep descents and climbs. Thanks to supple yak leather, a soft shaft end and a new, very comfortable insole, this high-quality trekking boot is not only like walking on clouds in Lhasa. <br><br>*** All Hanwag boots are sold under UK sizing - Please see size chart for details/conversion.",
