  "description": "<p>Completely environmentally friendly weather protection. The Alto Guide consists of the 3-layer Mammut DRYtechnology\u2122 Pro material made 100% from polyamide, i.e. a single component. The hard shell jacket is therefore recyclable. Polyamide is based entirely on castor oil, a renewable raw material. What\u2019s more, the water-repellent treatment is PFC-free.<br><br>Numerous practical features make the robust, windproof and waterproof Alto Guide an ideal weather protection jacket for mountain and hiking tours: The front pockets are compatible with a climbing harness. Drawstrings allow individual adjustment of the helmet-compatible hood with a reinforced peak and the hem width. Zippers under the arms can be opened to provide cooling air. The Alto Guide is a smart choice for your mountain sports adventures.</p>",
