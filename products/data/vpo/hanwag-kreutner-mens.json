  "description": "The Kreutner is a comfortable, mid-cut boot that covers a wide range of everyday scenarios. The construction is traditional, yet the styling is anything but. Double stitching is a technique that few other bootmakers master. The resulting footwear will literally last a lifetime. This mid-cut leather boot has a particularly soft upper cuff in nubuck leather for additional wear comfort and it\u2019s made completely in Germany. <br><br>The lightweight, cushioning Vibram Vi-Lite sole gives superb walking comfort during strike and roll-off. Inside, the lining and footbed are made of chrome-free tanned leather. And thanks to its traditional construction, this boot is fully resoleable \u2013 making it particularly long-lasting.<br><br>*** All Hanwag boots are sold under UK sizing - Please see size chart for details/conversion",
