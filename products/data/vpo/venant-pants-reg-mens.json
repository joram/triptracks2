  "description": "These slim-fitting, lightweight yet hardwearing climbing pants offer style with climb specific details. They have a jeans button fastening with a YKK\u00ae zip fly and contrasting chain stitch detailing throughout. The lower leg seams are cleverly diverted from the inner leg to avoid damage when cleaning off climbing shoes. They have four open pockets, one with an integrated brush slot with secure shockcord loop, and one concealed zip thigh pocket for valuables.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Built with a lightweight Matrix\u2122 stretch fabric, knee articulation, and a longer length gusset, they offer complete freedom of movement so you can send it with confidence. Breathable, quick-drying and ideal for spring and summer climbing trips, they have a part elasticated waistband with belt loops, that fits comfortably underneath a harness.",
