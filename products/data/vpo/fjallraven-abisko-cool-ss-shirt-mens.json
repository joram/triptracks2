  "description": "Light, well-ventilated outdoor shirt with short sleeves for trekking and travelling in warm climates. Made from lyocell, a viscose-like fibre that effectively wicks away moisture and gives a soft, comfortable <br>feel against the skin. Regular fit and two chest pockets with buttoned flaps. Underarm gussets give excellent freedom of movement, and a pair of sewn ventilation holes allow for extra airflow.",
