  "description": "<p>Made in recycled Gore-tex\u00ae Pro fabric and carried out in a unique parkas design, the premium Gore-Tex Pro Anorak is made for ultimate freeride protection.<br><br>Requested by Norrona ambassadors, the anorak is a highly functional freeride piece with a more spacious, relaxed fit. It\u2019s made in a very durable and protective 70D Gore-tex\u00ae Pro most breathable fabric with a long silhouette to provide maximum protection. <br><br>The anorak has a very long two-way underarm zipper that runs from the bottom hem to the elbow. This provides great ventilation, effortless dressing and makes it very easy to add or remove layers underneath while you\u2019re still protected. The front has a long, water-resistant two-way zipper and a spacious kangaroo pocket which is accessible from both sides. Due to the anorak design, they \u2019ve added a specially designed two-part snow skirt so you\u2019ll still be able to seal the snow completely out. <br></p>",
