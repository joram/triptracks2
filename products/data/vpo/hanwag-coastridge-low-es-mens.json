  "description": "Sporty design, lightweight construction and sustainable materials. The Coastridge Low ES is a dedicated lightweight shoe, designed for straightforward terrain and trails, shorter day hikes and active everyday use. Its fresh colourways and materials that further emphasise the sporty design. The synthetic upper is made primarily of a robust, polyester-based fabric, which is then reinforced with a leather heel and toe cap. On the sustainability front, this model has a PFC-free EcoShell membrane. Hanwag\u2019s proprietary waterproof, breathable and sustainable PU membrane is based on a complex, hydrophilic system that offers waterproofing and breathability without using fluorocarbons. Not only the membrane, but also the entire shoe is PFC-free. To ensure a perfect high-quality connection between sole and upper, we use Direct Injection technology, where the soft sole material is directly injected and connected with the shoe upper. This makes the new Hanwag Hike Light sole particularly lightweight and especially comfortable to wear. It\u2019s made of a selection of cushioning ingredients \u2013 softer PU at the heel and toe area \u2013 with stabilising rubber elements in the midfoot area. This multifunctional shoe is constructed deliberately without a distinctive heel \u2013 the flatter the terrain, the less you need one. This then ensures a smoother roll off for the foot.",
