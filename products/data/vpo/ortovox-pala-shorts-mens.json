  "description": "The massive, bizarre towers of the pala group protrude from the stony alpine plateau. Climbing here in the southernmost mountain range of the dolomites takes strong nerves - and strong material. Their merino shield tec line was designed especially for long, alpine routes like these!<br><br>the extremely scuff-resistant outer material used in the pala shorts for men achieves more than 50,000 abrasion cycles in the martindale test, which is used to measure scuff resistance. An athletic cut, 4-way stretch material and an anatomically shaped knee area give you full freedom of movement. The no-membrane construction of the pala shorts makes them particularly breathable, aided by fine merino wool inside and merino mesh inserts at the waistband for added comfort. The harness- and backpack-optimized pockets and topo pocket keep your items close at hand. The adjustment options at the ankles and waistband guarantee a perfect fit for every movement. For the sake of the environment, the entire merino shield tec line is also completely pfc-free and climate-neutral through carbon offsetting.<br><br>with its fresh look, the pala shorts for men is just right for big climbing routes on high rock faces.",
