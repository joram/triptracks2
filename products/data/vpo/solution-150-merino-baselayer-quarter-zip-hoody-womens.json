  "description": "Designed for high-output activity in the mountains, the Solution 150 Merino Quarter Zip Hoody features innovative patented Nuyarn stretch merino wool, a fabric that\u2019s stronger, warmer, and dries faster than other merino wool fabrics by utilizing the technology of wrapping a nylon core with extra fine merino fiber. The hoody offers superior thermoregulation and moisture management and is naturally bacteria and odor resistant. The flatlock stitching provides seams that don\u2019t chafe, while the hoody\u2019s shoulder panel is designed to eliminate pressure points while carrying a pack. Also, integrated thumb-holes make pulling on additional layers easy without bunching up your sleeves.",
