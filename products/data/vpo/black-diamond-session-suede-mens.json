  "description": "Engineered to send in style, the Black Diamond Session Suede combines ultimate comfort with performance features that seamlessly moves from the gym to the crag and then out to the city streets. The Session Suede's upper is durable and weather resistant and is combined with a stretch-fit heel for easy on/off transitions. That heel also folds down with ease for slip on functionality. The tuned EVA midsole keeps you cushioned and stable, while the Black Diamond BlackLabel-Street sticky rubber adds grip for approaches or commutes. Finally, webbing loops provide tagging or stowing options for trails that end at the cliff.",
