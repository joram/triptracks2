  "description": "When nothing is allowed to get between you and the summit, pull on Bergtagen Stretch Anorak. This hardwearing mountain anorak is engineered from four-way stretch fabric, allowing for full range of movement on challenging climbs. Great as a tough, ventilating and weather-resistant work-layer for spring and summer mountain activities, and it functions really well as a mid-layer too. The design is deliberately simple so it doesn\u2019t interfere with your harness or other equipment. It has a snug-fitting hood and a half-length front zipper. There\u2019s also a zippered chest pocket with inside pocket for small items. The double-woven stretch fabric\u2019s surface is durable, strong Cordura nylon, while the inside is recycled nylon that is soft against the skin and has a structure that facilitates moisture transport. Treated with PFC-free impregnation, it will resist brief showers and dry in no time if it gets wet. Elastic edging at hem and sleeve cuffs.",
