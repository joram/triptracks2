  "description": "Ultralight low cut sock for trail running. High wicking and breathable for optimal comfort.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For serious runners who like to explore the worlds trails at a faster pace. The Trail Run Ultralight Merino Sport Low has T2 targeted micro cushioning combined with extra ventilation for the perfect balance of protection and comfort on the toughest terrain. Merino Sport Fusion Technology provides resilient padding, moisture wicking, odour control and outstanding durability on the trails. The Sport Fit gives supportive compression for stability and balance around the ankle and mid foot and the zero debris cuff gives a close fit to prevent debris getting in and this means your sock won\u2019t slip down or bunch in your footwear. The natural toe box is wide and un-restrictive, allowing your toes to splay when running and the reinforced seam prevents splits and blow outs when descending. Built on a structure of LYCRA\u00ae and set by our Thermo Fit process ensuring the sock returns to its original shape and size after every wash. These socks deliver fantastic comfort for running whether on or off the trails.",
