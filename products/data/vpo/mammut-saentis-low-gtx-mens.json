  "description": "The Saentis Low GTX\u00ae Men is an extremely light and flexible multipurpose shoe that displays its talents in many applications. Its strength is fast-paced, narrow forest trails, but it will also become an absolute favorite shoe for the mountains. The Michelin\u00ae sole provides outstanding grip and an optimum sure-footed step. From the outside, the Saentis impresses with an extremely robust mesh that also provides additional protection from falling rocks for the sides of the feet and toes. Thanks to Gore-Tex\u00ae, not even rain can stand in the way of your adventures with this shoe.",
