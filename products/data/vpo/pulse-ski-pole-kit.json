  "description": "Pulse is Rundle's best value pole for serious racers and avid ski enthusiasts. Pulse's carbon layup is mostly high modulus carbon fiber for excellent stiffness. At 65g/m, the shafts have a swing weight approaching World Cup level shafts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pole kits include handles that come uninstalled, allowing the shafts to be trimmed and the handles to be installed at home. This allows a skier to build the poles to their exact length preference.",
