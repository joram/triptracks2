  "description": "Engineered for long approaches and extended ski tours where both glide and performance are paramount; the Black Diamond Glidelite Mohair Mix Skins have been refined with a progressive plush construction that maintains the optimal balance of grip vs. glide while increasing suppleness and durability. The next evolution of their STS Tail hardware reduces weight and packable size, increases the adjustable length from 10cm to 20cm, and is field replaceable. BD Gold Label Adhesive ensures a skin to ski bond, lap after lap, even in the harshest of conditions. Glidelite Mix Climbing Skins provide the ultimate performance and freedom of travel through the backcountry.",
