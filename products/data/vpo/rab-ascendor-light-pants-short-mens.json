  "description": "The new Ascendor Light Pant delivers the cut, the movement and the toughness to keep you in control at the rockface.<br>The slim, athletic fit improves moisture movement, while enabling you to place your feet with accuracy and confidence. As their lightest double-weave fabric, the 133gsm Matrix\u2122 softshell is also optimized for comfort on challenging ascents.<br><br>The lofted internal fibers wick moisture fast and the tightly woven external structure provides excellent wind, abrasion and weather protection, as well as rapid evaporation of transferred moisture. In addition to articulated knees and a diamond gusset, the fabric also offers generous four-way stretch for unimpeded climbing mobility.<br><br>With a reinforced hem, robust kick patches and twin-needle seams, this is the ideal partner for tough summer climbs and long, hot multi-pitch routes.",
