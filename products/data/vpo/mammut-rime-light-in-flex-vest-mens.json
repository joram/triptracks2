  "description": "Ideal as a thermal layer when using the layering principle, to keep the core of your body warm. The extremely light Rime Light Vest fits snugly to the body thanks to its stretch insulation and side inserts made from elastic Polartec\u00ae Power Grid\u2122 fleece. The Pertex\u00ae Quantum Air lining makes the vest wind-repellent as well as particularly breathable, extremely light and compressible. When you don\u2019t need the jacket, you can easily stow it away in the included bag \u2013 the Rime Light Flex can go with you everywhere.",
