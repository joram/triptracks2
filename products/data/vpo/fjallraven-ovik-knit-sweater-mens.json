  "description": "Comfortable sweater in soft, warm wool for everyday use and relaxed outdoor life. A beautiful patterned garment that also has excellent functionality as wool wicks away moisture from base layer garments and is one of few fibres that warms even when damp. <br><br>Perfect as an insulating middle layer under a shell jacket, or together with a down vest, for example, on warmer days.<br>Round neck and raglan sleeves with reinforced elbows. Ribbed edging at sleeve cuffs and hem.",
