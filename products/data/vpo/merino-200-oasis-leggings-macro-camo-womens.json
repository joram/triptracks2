  "description": "The benchmark against which all others are judged, the 200 Oasis Leggings Macro Forms are ultra-comfortable base layer bottoms that make the perfect foundation for cold-weather layering. Featuring icebreaker's best-selling 100% merino wool jersey fabric that\u2019s breathable, insulating, and odour-resistant, these bottoms also feature a brushed elastic waistband and flatlock seams throughout for a smooth next-to-skin feel. The unique all-over pattern draws inspiration from naturally occurring camo patterns. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Inspired by nature, icebreaker harnesses the performance qualities of natural fibres to offer an alternative to clothing based on petrochemical synthetics. Merino is an annually renewable fibre that naturally resists odours, keeps you cool when it\u2019s hot and warm when it\u2019s not, and lets your skin breathe for comfort all day, every day.",
