  "description": "You asked for it, and we built it. The original Java Grinder quickly became the best-selling product in our line, but the requests for greater capacity were overwhelming. The Java G45 utilizes machined aircraft grade aluminum and stainless-steel materials to deliver the world\u2019s finest hand-held coffee grinder. It produces roughly 50g of grounds depending on the roast. It\u2019s meticulously engineered for durability and ease of use: A retractable grinder handle converts to a carabiner attachment, a press-button release top cap allows quick access to the hopper, and the grinder knob attaches within the catch when not in use. What\u2019s more, it has 50 grind settings, ensuring you can dial in the perfect grind size for your chosen brewing method on any adventure.",
