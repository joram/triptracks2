  "description": "The newly designed 150 merino cool shirts and tops are now stronger and more robust \u2013 without sacrificing the cooling effect of tencel tm. Beta-spun technology from the s\u00fcdwolle group refers to a new spinning process in which a generous number of fine polyamide filaments are spun around a core of merino wool and tence ltm. The material is more scuff and tear resistant thanks to the protective polyamide outer layer, while maintaining the benefits of natural merino and tencel tm fibers. With this line you\u2019re perfectly equipped, for either alpine tours or long alpine climbs.",
