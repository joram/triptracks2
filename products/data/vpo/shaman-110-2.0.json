  "description": "It\u2019s back! The Shaman 2.0 is the revamped version of one of Icelantic\u2019s most iconic skis: the Shaman. They took components of the original Shaman design and integrated updated technology, materials, and profile shape to create a lively, more forgiving, and most importantly, fun ski.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Matching the width of their original Shaman shape, the Shaman 2.0 110 is an ideal choice for those who desire forceful, commanding turns through any condition the mountain provides. With an extremely tapered shape, wide shovel, and rockered tip and tail, you are able to stay in the front of your boot as you drive the ski through any condition the mountain provides, never having the tip dive in even the deepest snow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Featuring 8mm of camber underfoot and a tight, tapered sidecut radius, the Shaman 2.0 excels at seamless acceleration and maneuverability across all types of snow. It is truly a feeling unlike any other ski on the market. Whether you are a longtime Shaman skier or someone who is interested in a ride unlike anything you have ever felt before \u2014 get on a pair and you won\u2019t be disappointed!",
