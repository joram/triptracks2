  "description": "The 560 Realfleece\u2122 Elemental II Long Sleeve Zip is a heavyweight midlayer jacket ideal for cold-weather training, skiing or alpine climbing. Made with 100% pure and natural merino wool Realfleece\u2122, this full-zip jacket insulates in cold temps, breathes efficiently, and helps regulate your body temperature when you're moving fast. Zippered alpine hand pockets remain accessible while wearing a climbing harness, while the articulated sleeves improve range of motion. The droptail hem adds coverage in winter weather, while the elasticized cuffs and hem offer a secure fit. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Superfine merino fibres are brushed to create icebreaker Realfleece\u00ae, a natural fleece that warms and breathes next to your skin. Inspired by nature, icebreaker harnesses the performance qualities of natural fibres to offer an alternative to clothing based on petrochemical synthetics.&lt;br&gt;",
