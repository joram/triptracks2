  "description": "Engineered for speed approaches, the Black Diamond Mission LT is the approach shoe you want for mountain adventures that push the barriers in both scale and technical terrain. Designed with a sock-like, bootie fit, that\u2019s reinforced with a webbing cinch system, the Mission LT is lightweight and slips on to provide security and comfort that lasts all day. The Mission LT features our signature EnduroKnit, which is a one-piece, ultra-breathable upper for lasting temperature regulation that\u2019s hyper-durable for season after season of abuse. A tuned EVA midsole provides ample stiffness for technical precision, while remaining comfortable and the nylon rock plate provides protection. <br><br>The Mission LT\u2019s high-performance Black Diamond BlackLabel-Mountain rubber is super sticky, allowing you to grip through technical moves on 5th class terrain with ease, and the rubber toe protection gives the Mission LT added security. Multiple webbing loops give you plenty of tagging and stowing options when the approach ends and the hard climbing begins.",
