  "description": "Sewn loops of 10.5 mm Dyneema\u00ae webbing available in 4 lengths: 30, 60, 120 and 240 cm. Lightweight and low profile, they are ideal for building anchors and for use as extendable quickdraws. The 120 and 240 cm lengths are long enough to be equalized in anchors and the 60 cm is the right length for tripling as extendable quickdraws with lightweight carabiners.",
