  "description": "Technical and durable trekking tights in a highly functional stretch fabric. They combine the freedom of movement of tights with the durability of a pair of trekking trousers; reinforcements over the rear and knees can handle close contact with sharp stones and rocks and also resist moisture if you sit or kneel on damp ground. Perfect for all kinds of trekking in the mountains and other types of rough terrain.<br><br>The waist and the upper front are made from a woven stretch fabric, that together with belt loops and a fly give them a trouser-like look.<br><br>Practical leg pockets offer practical storage; a large one on the right-hand leg has room for a map and a smaller zippered one on the left-hand leg fits a compass \u2013 perfect for when you are heading out into the unknown. In addition, there is a pair of hand pockets with zippers and a little loop at the waist lets you attach gear or a light jacket close at hand.<br><br>The excellent fit and four-way stretch fabric gives a garment that has maximum freedom of movement, that can easily tag along on a shorter or longer climb and that will sit comfortably under a pair of shell trousers if it starts raining.",
