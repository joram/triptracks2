  "description": "A heavyweight base layer designed to keep you warm on the coldest of days, the 300 MerinoFine\u2122 Polar Long Sleeve Half Zip features icebreaker's incredibly soft, 100% Merino wool. The Polar's 15.5 micron MerinoFine\u2122 fibres naturally regulate body temperature and resist odours when you're working up a sweat, and the half-zip design allows for easy ventilation. Flatlock stitching reduces friction, while a droptail hem offers added coverage. <br><br>Inspired by nature, icebreaker harnesses the performance qualities of natural fibres to offer an alternative to clothing based on petrochemical synthetics. Merino is an annually renewable fibre that naturally resists odours, keeps you cool when it\u2019s hot and warm when it\u2019s not, and lets your skin breathe for comfort all day, every day.",
