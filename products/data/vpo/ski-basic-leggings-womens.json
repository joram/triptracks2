  "description": "Their new SKI basic leggings is our favorite staple this season. We have used our signature piqu\u00e8 fabric with the peached back, and made the best pair of leggings a girl could want. The front is without the center front seam, which makes it especially comfortable to wear during activities. (You know what we're talking about). Wear this with any of our ski base layers, as a training piece, or even with your sweater dress for cold days.",
