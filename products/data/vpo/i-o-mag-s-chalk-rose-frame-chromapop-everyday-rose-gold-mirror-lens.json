  "description": "You can only scope your line if you can see where you're going. Putting on the Smith I/O MAG goggles is like flipping the switch from regular to widescreen. Our ChromaPop\u2122 lens tech boosts color and contrast, so every wind lip, landing, and tree glade is as sharp as possible. It gets our highest level of anti-fog treatment and integrates with our helmets for airflow that keeps them fog-free through all weather conditions. Whether the day dawns clear or stormy, lens swaps are a snap thanks to our quick-swap MAG lens system. Because no two faces are the same, the I/O MAG S is scaled down to fit smaller faces.",
