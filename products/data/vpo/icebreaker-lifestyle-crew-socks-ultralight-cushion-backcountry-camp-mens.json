  "description": "The Lifestyle Ultralight Crew Backcountry Camp socks are ultra-lightweight socks for everyday comfort and style. Made with a luxurious blend of merino wool, nylon, and LYCRA\u00ae, these socks are breathable, stretchy and soft next to your skin. The uncushioned design features key support zones in the Achilles and instep, and the reinforced heels and toes are durable. The seamless toes reduce bulk and prevent blisters. <br><br>Inspired by nature, icebreaker harnesses the performance qualities of natural fibers to offer an alternative to clothing based on petrochemical synthetics. Merino is an annually renewable fiber that naturally resists odors, keeps you cool when it\u2019s hot and warm when it\u2019s not, and lets your skin breathe for comfort all day, every day.",
