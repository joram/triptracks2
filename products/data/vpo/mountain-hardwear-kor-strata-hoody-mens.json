  "description": "The original Kor Strata\u2122 Hoody was a minimalist midlayer for any kind of undertaking where all-over insulation is called for\u2014that vision stands true today, now with even more to look forward to. It still takes the sting out of monster and mundane missions alike, it's still fashioned for high-active pursuits, and it still brushes off beads of rain or sweat. A top performing piece for every winter-weather kit, we're pushing it in both function and form, bringing a more progressive silhouette for stand-alone sporting.",
