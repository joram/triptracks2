This innovative technology, with a separate layer of insulating air created on the inside of the garment, enables wool to compete with other garments that have a high warmth-to-weight value. Combined with the moisture-wicking and ventilating Expedition material under the sleeves and in the armpit, makes Tindin Hybrid a robust, protective and very comfortable mid-layer. In addition, the natural wool properties adds optimal temperature regulation and will keep your body warm even when it is wet. Can also be used as an outer layer on cold, clear days.</p>",
