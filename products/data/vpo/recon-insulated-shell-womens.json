  "description": "Designed specifically for women who desire extra warmth on lift days or sub-zero backcountry tours, the Recon Stretch Insulation Shell utilizes zoned insulation to trap body heat in key areas while remaining breathable on panels prone to overheating. The shell\u2019s durable 4-way stretch fabric is combined with their waterproof/breathable solution, BD.dry\u2122, to deliver a jacket ready for both in and out-of-bounds missions. With one chest pocket to hold essentials and two mesh internal drop pockets for skins or extra layers, the Recon features ample storage, while the jacket\u2019s removable powder skirt adds versatility for variable conditions. The Recon also has pit zip vents for easy temperature regulation on the skin-track, a waterproof front zipper and a ski-helmet compatible hood for added protection on storm days.",
