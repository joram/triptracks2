  "description": "Mountaineering puts the highest demands on your clothing, especially when it involves sheer rock. Bergtagen Stretch Trousers offer plenty of movability, ventilation and protection above the treeline. The hardwearing four-way stretch fabric readily lets out moisture on intense pitches, while giving you the freedom you need for your most daring moves. <br><br>The design is deliberately simple without any unnecessary frills or features that might interfere with a harness etc. There are two hand pockets and two leg pockets, all zippered, and mesh linings on the leg pockets make them double as ventilation openings. The leg endings have zippered gussets that can be adjusted to fit perfectly over a pair of ski touring boots. Elastic at the back of the waist allows for extra movement and a really comfortable fit. The double-woven stretch fabric is incredibly durable, with its surface in strong Cordura nylon and inside in recycled nylon with a structure that is soft against the skin and helps initiate moisture transport. They offer good wind protection and will even resist a brief shower. Treated with Pfc-free impregnation.",
