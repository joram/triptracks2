  "description": "The Banks is just a joy to hike in. Made from 100% finest LWG (Leather Working Group)-rated nubuck leather \u2013 a certification that guarantees not just particularly high-quality leather but also sustainable, eco-friendly leather manufacturing. The 1.5-millimetre thicker polyurethane foam wedge in the midsole gives smoother roll-off, noticeably better shock absorbency and longer lasting comfort. <br><br>The Banks is intended to be used on demanding hikes in terrain ranging from lower mountain ranges to the foothills of the Alps and easier hut-to-hut trails with a lightweight pack. And the GORE-TEX lining keeps feet reliably dry.<br><br>*** All Hanwag boots are sold under UK sizing - Please see size chart for details/conversion",
