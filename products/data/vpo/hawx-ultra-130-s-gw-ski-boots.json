  "description": "A comfortable and extremely powerful alpine ski boot, the Atomic Hawx Ultra 130 S GW offers a low-volume, 98mm fit to deliver performance to expert all-mountain skiers with narrower feet. By using the slimmest profile possible and then reinforcing critical power transfer zones, Prolite technology creates a lightweight and exceptionally stable boot for hard charging skiers. Completely customizable, a Mimic Platinum liner can be uniquely formed to the precise shape of the foot and Memory Fit provides advanced heating technology for a fully personalized shell and cuff. The Adaptive Fit System (AFS) Tongue can be repositioned to accommodate different foot shapes and instep heights while the 3D Stretch Toe Box allows for a little extra length. With a softer cuff compared to the Hawx Ultra 130 RS GW, the Hawx Ultra 130 S GW offers the ideal combination of effortless turn initiation, greater comfort, and better handling in a no compromise, 130 flex boot.",
