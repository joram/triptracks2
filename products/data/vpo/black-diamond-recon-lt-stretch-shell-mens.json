  "description": "A lightweight, durable workhorse shell, the Recon Stretch LT Shell features 3 layers of dependable protection for those in search of pow on either side of the rope. Slightly slimmed down from the Recon Stretch shell, the Recon LT Shell combines&nbsp;their BD.dry\u2122 waterproof/breathable solution with a lightweight ripstop fabric for a best-in-class combo of durability, protection, and minimal weight. Minimal in features, we kept the Recon LT lean and mean, with two pack compatible hand pockets roomy enough for essentials like gloves, beanie, and a headlamp. A snow helmet compatible hood finishes the style with added protection when heading into the storm.",
