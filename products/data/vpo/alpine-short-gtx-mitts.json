  "description": "Warm mitten in a shorter model with GORE-TEX membrane that makes it waterproof and highly breathable. Made of durable goatskin with a durable and stretchy softshell backhand. A neoprene cuff keeps the warmth inside the glove and provides a comfortable fit around the wrist. Perfect for downhill skiing and other outdoor activities in winter. As a mitten, it\u2019s particularly suitable if you need a little more warmth for your fingers, but this model is also available as a five-finger glove.",
