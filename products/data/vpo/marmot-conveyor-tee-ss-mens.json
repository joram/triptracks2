  "description": "The lightweight Men's Conveyor Short-Sleeve T-Shirt is the baselayer to wear when you know you'll work up a sweat on the crag. Moisture wicking and quick drying, the high-performance jersey fabric offers soft comfort from the moment you pull it on. When you make it to the mountain, forward-set side seams ensure you stay comfortable whether you've got a harness or a backpack on, and flatlock seams reduce chafing. The drop-tail hem at the back provides extra coverage and won't roll up during tough holds or far reaches.",
