  "description": "Fast and light, comfortable and supportive, the Aerios FL 2 Mid GTX is for extended hikes on technical trails. The design synthesizes with your foot to minimize friction, and the collar adds support and helps seal out debris. The upper is light, durable, and made from 100% recycled polyester, the lacing system wraps the foot for a natural fit and feel, and a GORE-TEX membrane delivers waterproof, breathable protection. Agility, stability, and confidence underfoot come from the Vibram\u00ae Megagrip outsole, compressed EVA midsole, and integrated TPU shank.",
