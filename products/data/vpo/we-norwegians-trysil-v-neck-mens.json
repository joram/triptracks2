  "description": "The Trysil sweaters brings back memories of the old ski heros of the 50s we see in black and white photos. Nostalgic and feel good pieces made with the most beautiful merino/cashmere yarns from Linsieme and knitted in Italy. This classic v-neck sweater is a beautiful piece knitted in a pearl knit yoke, with contrast panels on the sleeve. The neck opening is finished with a contrasting color as well. Layer it with the Sno Zip-Up, paired classic knickerbocker or your ski pants for a posh alpine look. Made in Italy.",
