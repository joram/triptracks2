  "description": "The Eisfeld Light Pants have been developed for sporty mountaineering and climbing. They are made from an extremely abrasion-proof soft shell double fabric and reinforced in areas particularly subject to wear. The highly elasticated material offers full freedom of movement. The pants\u2019 slim cut and narrow legs with an asymmetric hem ensure a precise fit and reduced abrasion. The wide waistband adjustment system allows you to easily adapt the fit from the outside. The Eiger collection incorporates the ideas of the Mammut Pro Team Athletes, which means that the Eisfeld Light Pants are packed with practical features: climbing harness-compatible pockets, adjustable leg hems and stowable attachment hooks. Soft shell pants for the most demanding requirements.",
