  "description": "Boots that rub at the front sides are often just too narrow at this area. Their solution: The Hanwag StraightFit-Extra Last. It\u2019s designed to offer additional room at the side of the forefoot and around the big toe. Enabling more comfort on easy trekking tours for hikers with wider feet. The Banks is made 100% of finest Leather Working Group (LWG) -certified nubuck leather. This confirms not just the particularly high quality of the leather, but also its compliance with environmental standards and sustainable manufacturing. <br><br>The 1.5-millimetre thicker polyurethane foam wedge in the midsole gives smoother roll-off, noticeably better shock absorbency and longer lasting comfort. The Banks is intended to be used on demanding hikes in terrain ranging from lower mountain ranges to the foothills of the Alps and easier hut-to-hut trails with a lightweight pack.<br><br>*** All Hanwag boots are sold under UK sizing - Please see size chart for details/conversion",
