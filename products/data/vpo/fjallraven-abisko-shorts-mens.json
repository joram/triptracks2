Intended for trekking and climbing when nothing should hinder your progress. The waist is a bit lower in the front and higher in the back to sit comfortably when carrying a backpack. An extra piece of fabric in the crotch and the placement of the inseams decrease the risk for rubbing. <br><br>The zippered hand pockets are placed for easy access even when wearing a hip belt. Large leg pocket with flap and a smaller mesh inner pocket on the right leg, a small pocket for a mobile telephone or GPS on the left leg. Stretch in the lower back and G-1000 reinforcement in the rear.",
