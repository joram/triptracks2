  "description": "Their Kinetic Alpine 2.0 Pant is the perfect \u2018pull-on, leave-on\u2019 piece for fast-paced summer alpinists.<br>As part of their Ascent range, it features Stretch Nylon Woven Proflex\u2122 with carefully zoned panels that are designed to cope with the increased abrasion and exposure of technical ascents without critically inflating the weight.<br><br>A slim, tailored cut with articulated knees provides far better freedom of movement than a traditional waterproof pant. The flat semi-elasticated waistband is comfortable with a harness, a plus a pair of zipped hem gussets enables you to expand the cuff for large mountaineering boots. Stripped back but high functioning, this is the ultimate in fast, light, free-moving protection for committed alpine adventurers.",
