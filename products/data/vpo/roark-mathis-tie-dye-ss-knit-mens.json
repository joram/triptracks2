  "description": "The Mathis Pocket Crew is designed to deliver the performance required out on the trails while maintaining the styling expected of your favorite tie dye tshirt. The Mathis is constructed from a lightweight DriRelease\u00ae jersey knit. DriRelease\u00ae promises to help regulate skin temperature with it\u2019s moisture wicking yarn construction. The fabric is also fast drying, typically 4x faster than a typical cotton tee. The style is designed with a slim pocket tee fit and features&nbsp;their Run Amok branding including an interior heat transfer to eliminate any discomfort and our climbing cord hanger loop to hang it out to dry and air out after a run. Because of the high quaity of our DriRelease\u00ae jersey knit the shirt is supremely comfortable with its soft &amp; natural feel and is easy to care for while maintaining its shape.",
