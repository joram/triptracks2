  "description": "Ski tour fans who limit the weight of their equipment and don\u2019t wish to change between ascent and descent gloves will love the fleece grid cover gloves! Made of fleece grid with fine merino wool, these lightweight gloves are soft and comfortably warm. A special channel structure makes the material lightweight while trapping heat in pockets of air. The highlight: these gloves come with integrated, retractable glove covers made from robust pertex quantum pro that can quickly and easily be pulled over the fingers to provide additional protection against snow, wind and cold on the descent. Silicone coating on the palms ensures the perfect grip on ski poles or ice axe. The thumb and index finger are seamless and equipped with smart finger functionality so they can conveniently be used to operate a smartphone screen.",
