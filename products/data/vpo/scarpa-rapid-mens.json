  "description": "Perhaps the best all-around mountain shoe we\u2019ve ever made, the Rapid lives at the junction of trail running and approach. This hybrid shoe is equally adept at ticking off trail miles, boulder hopping and scrambling moderate slabs. The Rapid is the perfect choice for moving fast over mixed mountain terrain, adept at handling all conditions from groomed single track to endless talus fields to slabby scrambles.",
