  "description": "Lightweight and well-insulating, you\u2019ll notice the Albula\u2019s impeccable warmth-to-weight ratio the second you have it on. What may be less obvious is its sustainable edge. Boasting a recycled polyester outer fabric and recycled polyamide lining, it\u2019s the insulation that really sets it apart. Filled with Thermore\u00ae Ecodown\u00ae, you can thank recycled PET bottles for your toasty warmth. The special synthetic fiber provides durable and efficient insulation even when wet. A popular classic, the Albula IN Hooded Jacket comes in the topographical print 'Terra Incognita' this season, so you can show your love of adventure and of Mother Nature at the very same time.",
