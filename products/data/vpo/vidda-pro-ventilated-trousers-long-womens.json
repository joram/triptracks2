The model is based on our best-selling Vidda Pro Trousers but has improved ventilation options and a new, slightly slimmer fit that still has great freedom of movement. The buttoned strap adjustments at the leg endings can be removed and there are numerous practical pockets and details, such as a knife pocket on the right leg and a loop for an axe on the side of the waist.",
