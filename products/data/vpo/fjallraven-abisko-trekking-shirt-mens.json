Made from a lightweight, technical fabric that wicks away moisture and lets in air at the same time as it feels cool against the skin. The collar can be turned up and secured in place for extra protection against the sun and the vertical chest pockets also function as ventilation openings. Perfect for hiking and travelling, and it can be packed into its own chest pocket.",
