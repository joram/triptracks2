  "description": "Hack it. Hike it. Hardcore outdoor action is all in a Day\u2019s work. Named for Dovetail Workwear co-founder, Kate Day, who worked the land growing up in Maine, owned a landscaping business, and never saw a shrub she didn\u2019t want to prune. Relaxed fit through the leg. Packed with reinforcements, from a double-button waistband up top, to tough cuffs at the bottom. This pant has our lowest front rise at the waist, but is high-backed at the rear\u2014because the only crack they like to see is dawn\u2019s!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NOTE: Due to the nature of this canvas fabric, some women SIZE UP in this pant.",
