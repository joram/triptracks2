  "description": "The benchmark against which all others are judged, the 200 Oasis Shorts feature icebreaker's most versatile, 100% merino jersey fabric for year-round layering performance across any activity. These short-length base layer bottoms provide the natural stretch, breathability and odor resistance of merino wool with a unique silhouette that provides partial coverage insulation in any season. <br><br>Inspired by nature, icebreaker harnesses the performance qualities of natural fibers to offer an alternative to clothing based on petrochemical synthetics. Merino is an annually renewable fiber that naturally resists odors, keeps you cool when it\u2019s hot and warm when it\u2019s not, and lets your skin breathe for comfort all day, every day.",
