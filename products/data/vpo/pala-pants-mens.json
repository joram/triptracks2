  "description": "The massive, bizarre towers of the pala group protrude from the stony alpine plateau. Climbing here in the southernmost mountain range of the dolomites takes strong nerves - and strong material. Their merino shield tec line was designed especially for long, alpine routes like these!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The extremely scuff-resistant outer material used in pala pants for men achieves more than 50,000 abrasion cycles in the martindale test, which is used to measure scuff resistance. Additional inserts in the anatomically shaped knee area provide maximum protection against craggy rocks. The 4-way stretch material and athletic cut provide full freedom of movement. Thanks to a no-membrane construction, pala pants for men are particularly breathable, while fine merino wool inside and merino mesh at the waistband add comfort. The harness- and backpack-optimized pockets and topo pocket keep your items close at hand. Adjustment options at the ankles and waistband guarantee a perfect fit for every movement. For the sake of the environment, the entire merino shield tec line is also completely pfc-free and climate-neutral through carbon offsetting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With its fresh look, the pala pants for men is just right for big climbing routes on high rock faces.",
