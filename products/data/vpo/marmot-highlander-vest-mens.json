  "description": "Forecast calling for cold? Rock the Highlander Vest over your favorite hoody or layer it under a shell and dial in the heat just right for the day. Your core will get all the cozy down insulation, while you arms remain free for all sorts of outdoor activities. Zip up your puffy 700-fill down vest when the cold gusts kick in on the midtown train or the gondola to and from the slopes. Generously sized pockets help keep your hands warm if the temps drop, and the vest packs down super small for easy-stuffing storage when things heat up.",
