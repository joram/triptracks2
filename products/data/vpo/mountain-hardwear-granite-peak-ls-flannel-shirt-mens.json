  "description": "A style that's stood the test of time, now in a fabrication that can actually push it further. With a pattern woven into the fabric, the design is permanently in the fiber of the flannel, not just printed over it. So, no matter how many hours on the road it's endured, campfires it's been subjected to, or post-ski antics it's participated in, it always looks and feels as fresh as the first wear.",
