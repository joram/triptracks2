  "description": "The Salt Long Sleeve is made of our finest, softest Merino yarn, mixed with some Creora-Eco-Soft. The shape of the t-shirt is a classic, straight fit with a sporty look. Use it for layering during Summer, or as a basic piece on it's own. The great thing about Merino wool is that you don't have to wash it very often. Just hang it up for airing after each use, and it will feel fresh for the day after. This is a great staple for your wardrobe, all year!",
