  "description": "Backup from the black sheep: As the Warmest Insulated Jacket, the Swisswool Zinal Jacket for men turns even sub-zero temperatures into comfortable warmth for Freeriding.<br><br>Robust Pertex\u00ae Quantum material provides protection on the outside, while Swisswool Black, the rare wool of the black sheep from the Swiss Alps, is used on the inside in varying weights: with a warm 150 g/m\u00b2 on the front and in the upper sleeve area, and a lighter 120 g/m2 in the hood and lower sleeve area.<br><br>The width-adjustable cuffs with elasticated inner seams will fit comfortably over your gloves and reliably keep the wind out, as will the high collar with fine Merino Mesh inside. The Swisswool Zinal Jacket for men also offers plenty of room for athletic turns and supports the back with a Lining of 100 % Merino Wool.<br><br>It is completely PFC-Free, Climate-Neutral and, thanks to the use of renewable raw materials in the insulation, also sustainable, making it an environmentally friendly choice. Simply perfect for freeriders who want to go their own way!",
