  "description": "Aenergy pants are a lightweight hybrid specifically for ski touring in cold conditions. They are designed for mountain activities that require the right balance of warmth and breathability. And the unique Octa lining are made of 100% recycled material on the front of the pants to do just that. The material provides excellent insulation even when wet while also allowing excess heat to dissipate for optimum temperature regulation. It combines a lightweight wind-resistant fabric with equally wind-resistant, light panels made of stretchy storm fleece with waffle structure for better freedom of movement and breathability. The two-way side zippers can be opened for ventilation at any time, and easy-access elastic mesh pockets on the hips provide plenty of handy storage. The Aenergy Hybrid is the perfect choice for strenuous activities in cold conditions.",
