  "description": "Looks cool and can do something. The Vason is just as good on dry, paved hiking trails as it is on the way to work or to your favorite Italian. The leather lining ensures a pleasant foot climate even when worn for long periods. The well-cushioned and profiled sole is just as sporty as the look. The all-rounder is also friendly to the environment. The outsole is made from 10% recycled rubber.<br><br>*** All Hanwag boots are sold under UK sizing - Please see size chart for details/conversion.",
