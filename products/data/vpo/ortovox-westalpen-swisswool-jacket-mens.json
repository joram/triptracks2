  "description": "With the westalpen swisswool jacket for men, you'll be perfectly prepared for stormy surprises in high alpine terrain. This warm, lightweight, insulated jacket is wind- and water-resistant and particularly scuff-resistant thanks to pertex quantum material. A swisswool inner lining provides comfortable insulation, with weights of 60 g/m2 and 90 g/m2 in different areas of the body to ensure the right temperature. The storm hood, high-cut collar, pre-adjusted cuffs and adjustable waist will keep out the wind and the cold, while the longer cut of the sleeves and torso ensures optimum freedom of movement, even when you have to stretch your arms up over your head. Small items that have to be reached quickly can be stored in the spacious front pockets and inner breast pocket. With its small pack size, the westalpen swisswool jacket for men&nbsp;is an ideal companion in high alpine terrain, because no matter how windy and stormy it gets outside, it will always keep you comfortable in the mountains.",
