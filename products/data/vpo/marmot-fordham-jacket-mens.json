  "description": "Backyard-to-brewery style forward and backed by the warmth and pillowy comfort of down, the Fordham Jacket will ensure you're looking good while conquering winter's worst. Explore the first snow of the season and keep it handy all winter long for freezing days and even colder nights throwing back brews by the firepit. Built with a protective, weather-shielding outer layer and stuffed with super-insulating 700-fill-power down, the Fordham takes the classic puffer style to a new level of casual-friendly performance.",
