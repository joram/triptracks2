  "description": "Snowshoers and cross country skiers will love the Methow Pants for exploring the frosty hills of its namesake, or for taking on more demanding cold weather treks in the Himalaya or Andes. Their weather-resistant exterior doesn't sacrifice on breathability, and a brushed fleece interior is only placed on areas that need the extra warmth. These soft shells are further enhanced with movement-mirroring stretch and UPF 50+ sun protection for frigid bluebird days when you need to think about the harsh reflection of sun on snow.",
