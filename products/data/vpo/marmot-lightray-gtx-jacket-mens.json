  "description": "Gear up for a pow day in the Men\u2019s GORE-TEX\u00ae Lightray Ski Jacket. It combines a waterproof, breathable GORE-TEX\u00ae shell with PrimaLoft\u00ae Black Insulation ECO to keep you cozy. With just a light base layer underneath this insulated jacket, you can comfortably crush greens to double blacks from first bell to last. Cool off quickly by opening heat-dumping PitZips when the powder gets deep and things warm up, and then batten down the hatches with a helmet-compatible hood when it\u2019s time to ride a windy lift. The RECCO\u00ae Avalanche Rescue Reflector bounces back a signal to rescuers for additional safety while skiing resorts.",
