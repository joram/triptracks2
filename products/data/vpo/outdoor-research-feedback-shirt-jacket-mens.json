  "description": "The Feedback Shirt Jacket utilizes recycled insulating materials for layering on cool days or when the sun sets beyond the horizon.  The torso is built with 100% polyester and a sherpa fleece lining for added insulation, while the arms feature VerticalX ECO insulation that breathes as it insulates. Snap button closures on the front and sleeves are a cinch to open and close, and the jacket features an interior left chest zip pocket and UPF 50+ sun protection.  The ultimate overshirt when temperatures drop, the Feedback Flannel Shirt is the go-to layering piece for casual outdoor wear.",
