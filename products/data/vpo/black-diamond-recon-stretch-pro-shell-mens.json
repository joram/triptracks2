  "description": "A bomber 3-layer shell built to blend both the movement of four-way stretch with the ultimate protection of BD.dry\u2122 while touring or ducking the rope, the Recon Stretch Pro Shell seals out moisture on storm days but keeps you dry on the skintrack without sacrificing durability. Reinforced forearms, elbows and hips add protection in high-wear areas from packs, tree branches and other on-mountain obstacles. The snow helmet compatible hood and internal removable powder skirt also adds armor against the elements while charging deep in the backcountry.",
