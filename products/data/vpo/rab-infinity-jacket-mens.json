Made from two weights of GORE-TEX INFINIUM\u2122 WINDSTOPPER\u00ae, the outer is reinforced in high wear areas for better protection.<br><br>Highly breathable, windproof and water repellent with a soft feel, this jacket is perfect for high energy ascents. The Infinity Jacket is engineered to maximize down lofting, retain the maximum amount of heat and minimize any water ingress. It achieves this with offset boxwall baffle construction and intelligent vertical stitching that channels water away from the down inside. The Infinity Jacket uses the highest quality, 800FP goose down treated with a Nikwax\u00ae hydrophobic finish.<br><br>Designed for vertical ascents, the down jacket has a fully adjustable, helmet compatible hood with stiffened peak, articulated sleeves for full freedom of movement, and a two-way YKK\u00ae VISLON\u00ae \u00ae AquaGuard\u00ae front zip with insulated storm flap. It has multiple zipped pockets, including two useful inner stretch mesh pockets for swallowing up a water bottle or gloves and a relaxed fit to accommodate extra layers when the temperature starts to plummet.",
