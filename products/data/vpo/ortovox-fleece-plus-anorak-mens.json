  "description": "When freeriding, clothes need to be warm, functional and lightweight \u2013 just like the anorak, hoody and vest in the fleece plus line! To withstand the cold and all kinds of weather on rapid descents in steep couloirs, we rely upon a combination of warm merino fleece plus, containing merino wool and recycled polyester, and elastic tec stretch. The clever positioning of quilted, elastic and wind-resistant tec stretch material in the shoulder and hood areas makes the line robust and a visual highlight. On the inside, merino fleece light provides soft comfort and perfectly regulates the wearer\u2019s personal climate. Merino fleece plus in the hip and stomach areas keeps the wearer cozy and warm. Thanks to their ideal fit, they provide the freedom of movement needed to swiftly initiate the next turn \u2013 even in steep gullies. Sustainability is a priority: the line is pfc-free and produced in europe.",
