  "description": "The perfect pant to help fight the frigid days of fall, keeping you warm even through the winter. A straight leg shape makes it easy to pair with any footwear, whether for the cabin or through the snow, and its drawcord belt system with snaps wears smoothly under a sweater or with baselayers. With a softshell exterior that resists inclement weather, backed with ultra-soft fleece that comforts skin as it brushes through movement, the Yumalina dares to brave the cold, so you can accomplish more in the freezing seasons.",
