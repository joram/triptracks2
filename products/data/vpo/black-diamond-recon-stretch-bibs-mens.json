  "description": "Black Diamonds full-coverage, fully taped waterproof/breathable snow bibs featuring a dynamic four-way stretch 20k/20k BD.dry\u2122 laminated fabric that's perfect for backcountry tours or stormy resort days, the Recon Stretch Bib protects against over-the-shoulders conditions, wet spring snow and everything in between. The Recon's dynamic BD.dry\u2122 shell fabric seals out wetness from the outside while a highly-breathable DWR-treated doubleweave bib keeps you dry from overheating on the inside. A side zipper makes for easy on and off and zippered chest, thigh, and hand pockets store your phone, lip balm and other small essentials. Pack-friendly low-profile adjustable suspenders and a waistbelt help secure the perfect fit.",
