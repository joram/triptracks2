  "description": "The Willoughby hiking sock might be named after Vermont\u2019s most insta-spammable lake, but the real influencers are the sure-footed critters paddling across its buttery-soft, ribbed cuff. Dip into these lightweight Micro Crew height socks, knit with climate-controlling Merino Wool and cozy cushion underfoot, and you\u2019ll be trekking on without fear of the dreaded swamp-foot that can lead to blisters.",
