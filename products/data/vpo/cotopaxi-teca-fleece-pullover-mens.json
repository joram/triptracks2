  "description": "What dreams are made of. Sustainably-minded, super cozy, and bright as can be, the Teca Fleece is the cold-weather cousin of their Teca Windbreaker. This iteration takes Cotopaxi original full-length zipper out of the equation and replaces it with a classic snap opening. Great as a stand-alone jacket or midlayer, each Teca Fleece is made from best-in-class, recycled fleece and DWR-treated, polyester taffeta left over from other companies\u2019 production runs. This keeps perfectly good materials out of the landfill, instead putting them in the hands of thoughtful adventurers like you.",
