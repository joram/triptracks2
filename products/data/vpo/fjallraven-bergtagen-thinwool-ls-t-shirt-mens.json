  "description": "<p>For spring and summer days spent above the treeline, this long-sleeved top makes a great first layer. Made from a fine Merino wool jersey knit, it is lightweight, pliant and comfortable to wear against the skin. At the same time, it helps regulate body temperature which is useful when alternating between different activity levels, or for when you leave the cabin before day break.<br><br>But keeping you warm when it\u2019s cold and cool when it\u2019s hot isn\u2019t the only good thing about Bergtagen Thinwool. It is also naturally odour resistant, and the wool fibres wick moisture away from the body, keeping you comfortably dry and happy throughout the day. <br><br>Bergtagen Thinwool is a great choice for all kinds of mountain activities, as soon as the spring sun starts warming. The Merino wool used in Bergtagen base-layers is mulesing-free and traceable back to its farm of origin. </p>",
