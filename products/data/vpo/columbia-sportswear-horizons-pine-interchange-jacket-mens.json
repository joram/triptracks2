  "description": "This jacket is super adaptable. Worn together, the two distinct layers create one incredible jacket. Brisk days don't stand a chance against the liner of this jacket, enhanced with our thermal reflectivity for bonus warmth. The critically seam-sealed outer shell works on rainy days with waterproof-breathable technology, an adjustable hood, and cuffs.",
