Featuring a 2.5-layer 10K/10K fabric that\u2019s fully seam-sealed, the Treeline is breathable and moves with you while on the go but remains 100% windproof and waterproof. A YKK\u00ae Aquaguard center front zipper keeps moisture out, while the DWR adds ventilation. A back vent with mesh pockets also keeps you dry and cool with passive airflow. <br><br>They\u2019ve also included two backpack-friendly zip hand-pockets to store your on-trail essentials. The single-adjust climbing- helmet-compatible hood protects you in the heaviest downpours while the adjustable hem and cuffs dial in the fit on the move.",
