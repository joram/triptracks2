  "description": "Built for a wide range of active pursuits in cool weather, the Deviator Hoodie can retain warmth when it's crucial yet breathe and sheds heat when moving. A new insulation technology called VerticalX\u2122 Octa paired with hybrid-mapped ActiveTemp\u2122 fabrics offers a more effective function for active use. VerticalX\u2122 Octa does not require an interior liner fabric and has an open structure, allowing it to breathe more effectively. It's also 50% lighter than traditional polyester insulation, has an outstanding warmth-to-weight ratio, is superb at wicking moisture, and is soft against the skin. A 20D stretch-woven softshell fabric on the front, shoulders, sleeves, and hood provides weather resistance, and a breathable polyester/spandex grid fleece on the back, side panels, and under the arms provides a full range of motion. The Deviator Hoodie is a breathable insulator, ideal for high-output pursuits in cool weather.",
