  "description": "A hardshell jacket for year-round use. This lightweight multi-talent is not only water- and windproof, it is also durable and extremely breathable. Scoring as high for performance as it does for comfort, its generous pockets and adjustable hood with reinforced peak pair perfectly with a climbing harness and helmet. Its great fit and elastic material leave you plenty of room to move, while underarm ventilation keeps you fresh while you're at it.",
