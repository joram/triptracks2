  "description": "Autumn weather in the coastal town of Visby, Sweden, can change from wet and windy to freezing cold in no time, so this namesake jacket is designed for practical versatility. It is a waterproof, breathable shell jacket that can be worn by itself in mild weather or zipped together with a padded inner jacket on colder days. And should you like the soft style of the inner jacket, it can be worn by itself in dry weather as well. Perfect for city and beach walks, all year round",
