  "description": "The Ski+ Ultralight Over the Calf socks are durable, stretchy and highly breathable socks for skiing the resort or the backcountry. The minimally cushioned design features a blend of merino wool, nylon and LYCRA\u00ae that\u2019s anatomically sculpted with key support zones in the ankle, Achilles, and instep. The breathe zone increases ventilation, and the seamless toe reduces bulk and prevents blisters. <br><br>Inspired by nature, icebreaker harnesses the performance qualities of natural fibres to offer an alternative to clothing based on petrochemical synthetics. Merino is an annually renewable fibre that naturally resists odours, keeps you cool when it\u2019s hot and warm when it\u2019s not, and lets your skin breathe for comfort all day, every day.",
