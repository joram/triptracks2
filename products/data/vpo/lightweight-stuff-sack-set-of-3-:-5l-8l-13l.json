  "description": "Each Stuff Sack in this set is made from a durable 70D recycled Nylon and is the perfect solution for organized modular packing on any adventure. A white interior coating helps to shed moisture and makes finding your contents easy. The unique tear-proof drawcord top with Capture Cord Lock opening is easy to use. The three colors provide for optimum color coding and organization of your gear. These tough Nylon Stuff Sacks do not have taped seams or a roll-top closure; so they are water resistant rather than waterproof.",
