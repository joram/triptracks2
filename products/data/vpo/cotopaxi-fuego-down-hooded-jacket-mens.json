It\u2019s made with responsibly sourced, water-resistant 800-fill goose down, making it the lightweight down jacket they can\u2019t seem to take off from fall through spring\u2014they even take it camping in the summer. <br><br>This versatility comes courtesy of its updated fit, toasty down insulation, and DWR-finished ripstop nylon shell. They also added a built-in scuba hood and elastic binding throughout, further sealing out the cold, and the assortment of stash pockets throughout provide space for all your essentials. Rounding out the Fuego is an adjustable drawcord at the hem and an updated zipper for silky operation in all conditions.",
