Even still, though, once they\u2019re on, you might be surprised by what you feel. Made with a super-soft French terry blend that brings the comfort of post-consumer recycled Merino wool, our Women\u2019s Recycled Terry Crop Wide Leg Pant features a relaxed fit for room to move and a drawcord at the waist for adjustability. And the cherry on top is the two drop-in pockets for hand warmth or storage. With all they\u2019ve got to offer, these pants aren\u2019t just comfy. They\u2019re SUPER comfy.",
