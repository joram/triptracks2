  "description": "The new TTS Transit transports skiers to the backcountry and beyond.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If your waking moments are filled with thoughts of far-away snow laden landscapes and the rhythmic *slick* of skis carving a fresh groove in untouched terrain, then the TTS Transit binding may be for you. And if that sounds more like reality than a daydream, then they are DEFINITELY for you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The focus\u2014ever on simplicity\u2014translates here to a functionally straightforward binding that adapts easily to your desires. No fuss or undue fiddling: three activity positions from neutral to active can be changed on the fly without a bench or tools. Those familiar with Voile's bomb-proof spring cartridges already know the ease of micro-adjustment, so no explanation needed there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Half the binding's weight can be removed and stowed away for fast and light ascents. Already incredibly light at 548g each, and paired with Voile's reputation of durability, the TTS Transit is a sure bet for the go-far ski tourer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sold as a pair.&lt;br&gt;Crampon sold separately.",
