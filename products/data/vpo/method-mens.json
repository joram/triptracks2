  "description": "&lt;p&gt;The Black Diamond Method is built for sending sport pitches, from the blocky limestone of Rifle to the enduro sandstone of the Red. By prioritizing forefoot comfort and a minimal break-in period, the Method is easy on the feet out of the box, while maintaining stiff edge control for increased power for newer outdoor climbers. With a downturned last that\u2019s not ultra-aggressive, these shoes perform well on a variety of angles, from steep to vertical, making them a one-quiver sport shoe for those who value simplicity. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The molded sticky rubber\u2014inspired by the way they forge their carabiners\u2014is not cut from one sheet, allowing them to optimize the molds for minimal waste, low weight, consistency and comfort. A stretch-resistant micro-fiber upper provides next to skin comfort, and the tongue is made from their cush, microsuede lined woven textile, which is exceptionally breathable and increases mobility. The Method wraps it all up with Velcro straps that allow you to dial in the desired tension and fit. &lt;/p&gt;",
