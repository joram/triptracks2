  "description": "The Voss Long John is made of our Merino Pique Knitting technique. We enhanced the interior finish this season with a lightly brushed quality which provides ample next to skin comfort. The side panel stripe detail is new addition this season as well. While we love it best as a base layer, the Voss Long John is a great multi-use layering item for hiking or cold weather running ... and it looks pretty good too!",
