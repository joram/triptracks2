  "description": "Light, convenient hooded sweater that combines two different fleece fabrics to warm where it is needed most and keep weight and packing volume down. The hood, shoulders and chest are made from flat-knitted polyester fleece (partially recycled) with a soft brushed inside, while the sides, lower torso and lower sleeves are in a lighter grid-structured fleece with superior ventilation. Perfect as a fast-drying and moisture-wicking mid layer on day trips or chilly summer evenings. Comfortable hood and one-way zipper in front opening. One chest pocket and two hand pockets, all with zippers.",
