  "description": "The Atomic Hawx Prime XTD 115 W GW blends all mountain skiing and freeride touring into this 100mm medium last crossover boot. The stiffest and highest performing boot in the women\u2019s Prime XTD family, it uses Prolite, a shell construction that starts with the lightest profile possible and then adds reinforcement to critical energy zones to create a super robust boot that delivers supremely powerful skiing. The heat-moldable Mimic Platinum liner and Memory Fit shell allow for complete customization of the cuff, shell and liner. The cuff offers 54\u00ba range of motion to deliver epic natural movement for easy walking and more comfort when standing upright. The removable Adaptive Fit System (AFS) Cuff spoiler increases the amount of tulip-shape and volume inside of the cuff to accommodate different sized calves. The GripWalk Sole is compatible with all GripWalk, MN, MNC and Pin bindings. Extremely powerful, this is the ideal boot for those excited to ski the entire mountain.",
