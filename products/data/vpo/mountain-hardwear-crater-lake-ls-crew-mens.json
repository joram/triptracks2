  "description": "Whether you're cranking at the boulders or skinning up a backcountry run, those first rays of warming spring sunshine after a long winter are something special. While you're soaking up that Vitamin D, the Crater Lake\u2122 Long Sleeve Crew has you protected from unwanted UV rays thanks to its UPF 50+ fabric. This lightweight and comfortable top also pulls double duty as a breathable baselayer when the clouds roll in and it's time to layer up.",
