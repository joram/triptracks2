  "description": "Designed to fill the functional gap between Keb Jacket and Abisko Midsummer Jacket, this is a light, well-ventilated option for warm-weather treks. Underarm stretch gussets and a full-stretch back pa- nel provide great fit and airflow. The stretch is combined with G-1000 Lite Eco fabric for protection from the elements and to resist abrasion from backpack straps etc. Well-fitting hood and zippers at the sides for additional ventilation on intense treks.",
