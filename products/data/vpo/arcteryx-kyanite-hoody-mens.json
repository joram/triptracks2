  "description": "Seriously versatile, the Kyanite is the fleece you grab for quick climbs, ski days, cold hikes, and to cut the chill when you roll out of bed. Worn as a midlayer or standalone, it delivers warmth with freedom of movement and soft comfort. The Polartec\u00ae Power Stretch\u00ae Pro has a nylon face for abrasion resistance, a lofty brushed interior, and four-way stretch. The clean fit delivers unrestricted comfort and layers easily under a shell, and a low-profile hood adds warmth.",
