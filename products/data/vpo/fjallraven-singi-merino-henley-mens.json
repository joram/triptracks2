Made from traceable Merino wool and durable nylon filament yarn, it wicks moisture away and insulates even when damp. Plus its natural anti-bacterial properties keep odors at bay, which is practical on multi-day trips when you don\u2019t have the chance to wash so often. A great-looking  first-layer top for many types of outings.",
