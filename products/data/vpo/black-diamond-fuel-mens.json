  "description": "Engineered for days when the word \u201capproach\u201d actually involves full-on climbing, the Fuel is their most technical performance shoe. The Fuel\u2019s upper combines breathable EnduroKnit, a durable stretch woven lateral panel, and welded TPU film overlays for maximum durability and precision fit. The internally overlapping tongue allows for fewer seams and a sleek comfortable fit with minimal bulk, while the lace-to-toe construction features webbing and scalloped eyelets for variable, adjustable fit and tensioning to suit di\u00a1erent conditions. <br><br>A climbing-specific forefoot construction allows for exceptional edge control and their BlackLabel Mountain rubber is ultra-sticky for superior grip on rock. Finally, a tag-loop on the heel and tongue gives you the option to clip the Fuels to your harness once you rope up.",
