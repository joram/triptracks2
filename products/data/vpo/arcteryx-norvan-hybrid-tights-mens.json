  "description": "Thermoregulation, stretch, weather protection \u2013 the Norvan Hybrid Tight keeps you running all year. The hybrid design starts with a durable, breathable nylon with a warm brushed backer and outstanding stretch, then places highly breathable four-way stretch GORE-TEX INFINIUM\u2122 at the thighs to block wind and repel water and snow. The articulated patterning and ergonomic features are fine-tuned for mountain running, and the design layers easily with our Norvan shorts.<br><br>The Norvan Hybrid Tight offers the same performance as the past season's Norvan Hybrid Pant in a more efficient fit.",
