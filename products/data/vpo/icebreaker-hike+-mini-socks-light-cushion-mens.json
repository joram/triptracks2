  "description": "<p>The Hike+ Light Mini socks are durable, breathable, and naturally odor-resistant socks for lightweight trips out on the trails. The half-cushioned, quick-drying design is anatomically sculpted for premium fit and comfort, with key support zones in the ankle, Achilles, and instep. Reinforcements in the heel and toe increases durability, while the seamless toe reduces bulk and prevents blisters. <br><br>Inspired by nature, icebreaker harnesses the performance qualities of natural fibers to offer an alternative to clothing based on petrochemical synthetics. Merino is an annually renewable fiber that naturally resists odors, keeps you cool when it\u2019s hot and warm when it\u2019s not, and lets your skin breathe for comfort all day, every day. </p>",
