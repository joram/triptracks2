Particularly fine merino wool at 21.5 microns in thickness feels pleasant on the skin and makes these warm socks elastic and stable. The natural properties of merino wool really come into their own in the foot area, naturally regulating the temperature and moisture while also neutralizing unpleasant odors.<br><br>The circular-knitted all mtn quarter socks warm for men are designed to fit perfectly without any irritating seams, thus reducing areas that rub or dig in. Made for extremely cold days, the warm version of the all mountain socks are fully lined with sculptured terry-lining, a special knitted construction that optimally traps heat and creates the perfect climate with air pockets. The ankle and arch support ensures a good fit and prevents the socks from slipping or creasing. You can also say goodbye to blisters in the toe area in future thanks to the flat toe seam. The all mtn quarter socks warm for men are thus the perfect companion for your feet during the cold season.",
