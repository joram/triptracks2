  "description": "For their Sno base-layer they have used their favorite yarn from Sudwolle, the Nm 1/60, 100% super fine merino wool, 17,5 microns, and added some Creora-Eco-Soft, to make the fabric stretchy. It`s a single jersey that`s light and breathable. Feels like a second layer of skin. The hoodie has flat lock seams for better comfort, and a fitted shape. The shape of the hood is fitted, so that it can be used under your ski helmet. It`s finished with a 1/4-zip in front if you need ventilation.",
