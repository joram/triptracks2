  "description": "Sustainability is the watchword in the 140 cool line, because it consists of 100% natural fibers with the perfect properties for intense sports on hot days. Fine Tasmanian merino wool is comfortable and soft, naturally moisture-regulating and neutralizes unpleasant odors, while the cellulose fiber Tencel\u2122 lyocell has a cooling effect thanks to its flat surface and high evaporative coolness. The shirts in the 140 cool line are light and particularly comfortable, yet are still robust for use in alpine terrain. With its sporty fit and casual print, the 140 cool line always cuts a fine figure \u2013 whether on the mountain or in the valley.",
