  "description": "Designed to flow on the trails, from big mountain objectives to pre-work jaunts down the backyard loop, the Flatiron Shorts will take it all in stride. Featuring two inseam options of 7, and 5-inches, with a side-split for extra mobility, these shorts also feature PFC-free DWR for added weather resistance. A single back zippered pocket fits a headlamp and other essentials while you\u2019re on the move, and the reflective trims add visibility when you push past the daylight hours.",
