  "description": "The Hanwag Makra Trek SF Extra GTX trekking shoe is the right shoe for longer hikes and multi-day tours with a heavy backpack. In this model, HANWAG uses the StraightFit Extra last. It combines the generous, wide toe box of the StraightFit lasts, which allows for a straight position of the big toe, with additional space in the forefoot area and the ball area of the Wide lasts. As a result, it offers a great fit for people with a wider forefoot - or who want more room for their big toes. Despite the roomy toe box, the midfoot is firmly enclosed to ensure perfect support even on more difficult terrain. A secure fit in the forefoot and good overall stability is also provided by the optimized Ghilly lacing, which runs through textile loops to the toe box.",
