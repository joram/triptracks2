  "description": "Built for the long-haul, the Mission Leather Mid WP is an approach shoe that provides ankle protection and support when heading into the hills with heavy packs and big objectives on the horizon. Featuring a waterproof/breathable BD.dry lining combined with a high-grade Nubuck leather upper, the Mission Leather Mid WP keeps you dry while moving through stream crossings and snow fields. <br><br>The padded ankle provides protection through scree fields and rocky terrain; and the climbing forefoot and toecap construction, which features our BlackLabel-Mountain sticky rubber adds precision when the trail kicks up into a scramble. Deep, high traction lugs provide grip in mud, and the fully gusseted tongue is padded for maximum comfort while keeping dirt and debris out. A tuned EVA midsole provides ample stiffness and precision when aiding through vertical terrain or Via Ferratas, and multiple webbing loops give you tagging options when the approach ends and the climbing begins.<br>",
