  "description": "When the forecast calls for snow, set your alarm early and head for the mountain with your Refuge Pro Jacket and skis in tow. 3-layer NanoPro\u2122 technology brings the heat with ultra-breathable, waterproof protection for backcountry powder searching missions and wide-open groomers on ski trips out west. Pop up the helmet-compatible hood to keep chairlift gusts at bay, or open the PitZips to dump some heat while slogging up the skin track. Your lift ticket and safety essentials will stay safe stowed in waterproof pockets whether you're gracefully skiing inbounds or exploring untouched terrain far from any chairlift.",
