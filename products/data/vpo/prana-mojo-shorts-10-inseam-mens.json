  "description": "Looking for a sustainable style built with all the performance features you could ever want and need? What about one that also stays comfortable and secure as you move? Good news: prAna has got the answer you\u2019ve been searching for. And they call it their men\u2019s Mojo Short.<br><br>It's made with 100% recycled polyester, so it feels good in more ways than one. But this microfiber fabric isn\u2019t just lightweight and comfortable, it\u2019s also strong, with UPF 50+ and quick-dry properties. They also added a full inseam gusset for extra mobility.<br><br>All this is already great, but of course they added even more. It\u2019s why you\u2019ll find mesh-lined pockets on the front, a back pocket with Velcro pull-tag closure for safety, and a plush waistband that gives you security without the scratchiness sometimes caused by elastic.",
