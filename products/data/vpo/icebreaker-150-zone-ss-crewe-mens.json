  "description": "An ultralight base layer top ideal for year-round layering and active adventures, the 150 Zone Short Sleeve Crewe is breathable, durable, and odor-resistant. The Zone combines lightweight, odor-resistant corespun merino fabric with strategically placed merino mesh panels to help regulate temperature during stop-and-go days on the trail or in the mountains. Raglan sleeves and underarm gussets allow for unrestricted range of motion, and flatlock stitching eliminates chafing.\n\nInspired by nature, icebreaker harnesses the performance qualities of natural fibers to offer an alternative to clothing based on petrochemical synthetics. Merino is an annually renewable fiber that naturally resists odors, keeps you cool when it\u2019s hot and warm when it\u2019s not, and lets your skin breathe for comfort all day, every day.",
