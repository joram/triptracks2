  "description": "With a hybrid design balancing durability, stretch, and water repellency, the Gamma Guide Pant meets the exacting demands of guides and mountain professionals. The thighs and seat use Burly\u2122 double weave for abrasion resistance and weather protection. Wee Burly\u2122 material is used on the back and lower half of the legs to shed weight and improve breathability. Harness-accessible thigh pockets hold notepads and digital tools, the lower leg unzips to fit over boots, and the clean fit is articulated for freedom of movement.",
