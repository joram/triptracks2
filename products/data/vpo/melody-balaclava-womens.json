  "description": "The Melody Balaclava is perfect for regulating temperature during high-tempo activities on cooler days spent outdoors. ActiveTemp thermo-regulating technology adjusts to the body's output level, ensuring comfort as the pace quickens. Breathable and quick-drying Melody fabric wicks moisture away from the head, face, and neck. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The hinge construction and ponytail port allow customized coverage and hair organization as the outdoor temperature varies, while the low-profile design fits perfectly under a helmet. Fitting snugly on the face and neck, the Melody Balaclava can be worn in multiple ways, making it a great addition to any outdoor adventurer's gear.",
