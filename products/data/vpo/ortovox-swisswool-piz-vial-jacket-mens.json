  "description": "Even on biting cold winter days, the Swisswool Piz Vial Jacket and Vest keep ski tourers on track. With their full coverage 90g/m\u00b2 lining and an ideal weight-to-insulation ratio, they are the warmest swisswool items in the ski touring collection \u2013 and thanks to the noticeable mountain peak quilting probably the coolest, too. Their innovative pertex\u00ae quantum diamond fuse outer material consists of a thick-knit diamond-shaped yarn made from 100 % recycled polyamide and is windproof, water-resistant, breathable and extraordinarily robust. <br><br>The active, ergonomic and at the same time casual cut provides maximum freedom of movement. The jackets and vests are equipped with a high collar and elasticated inserts on the cuffs and armholes to combat the icy air in the mountains. Of course, the swisswool piz vial line is also climate-neutral and PFC-free.",
