They offer our latest technologies, including our 4 Degree\u2122 elite fit system for a dialed-in fit and our patent-pending Indestructawool\u2122 technology for amazing durability. For a higher level of comfort, these socks are designed with responsibly sourced Merino wool, which naturally helps with temperature regulation, odor control, and breathability, as well as additional body-mapped mesh zones, a Virtually Seamless\u2122 toe, and a \"stay put\" fit. And best yet, they have the pride flag knit right into the design, so you can show your support of the LGBTQ+ community.",
