  "description": "A burly 3-layer bib built for deep days in the backcountry from the Chugach to Chamonix, the Recon Stretch Pro Bib combines a breathable stretch racerback upper bib with a reinforced seat and knees for added protection in the backcountry. The BD.dry\u2122 shell fabric seals out moisture for over- the-shoulder off-piste conditions and storm day sidecountry missions, while the four-way stretch adds mobility and breathability while earning your turns. A center-front zipper entry provides easy on and off, and the separating front bib strap has a ladder-lock adjustment for dialing in the fit.",
