  "description": "Their lightest and most breathable midlayer.<br><br>This extremely lightweight fleece jacket is developed for ski touring, but is also great for general outdoor activities, especially mid to high-intensity, due to its excellent breathing and insulation properties.<br><br>The jacket is made in two premium fleece fabrics: Polartec Alpha and the lightest warm1. The Alpha provides excellent insulation and breathability, and the warm1 pulls moisture from the skin and transfers it to the outer surface to dissipate quickly.<br><br>The Alpha fabric is a highly open-knit recycled Polartec\u00ae Alpha\u00ae 90 (90 grams/m2), which offers consistent warmth while continuously releasing excess body heat and allowing excellent breathability during activity, both the \"stop\" and \"go\" phases. This fabric is used on the upper body and arms.<br><br>The lightweight warm1 fabric is a 103 g/m2 (94% recycled polyester, 6% elastane) advanced next-to-skin moisture management fabric using a bi-component knit construction for maximum efficiency. This fabric is placed on the lower torso and under the arms. Together, they make for a highly open and moisture-efficient structure, and the jacket works perfectly as a baselayer.<br><br>Key features include: A small chest pocket, elastic cuffs with thumbholes, and a high collar for extra comfort protection.<br><br>The jacket has a technical fit with Y-cut and articulated arms for good alpine movement.",
