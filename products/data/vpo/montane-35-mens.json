  "description": "If you frequently find yourself exploring the deep powder of the backcountry, you should become better acquainted with the Montane. Featuring Atlas\u2019s best-in-class tubular frame, the Reactiv\u2122, for improved flotation and responsiveness, the Montane takes backcountry performance to new heights. Comfortable and easy to use, the all new Montane Wrapp-BC\u2122 binding is lighter in weight and features a sleek crampon-style yoke binding helping eliminate pressure points while ensuring a secure fit. Heel and ankle strap roller buckles allow quick, easy, and intuitive access in and out of the bindings. While 19\u00b0 heel lifts provide relief on ascents.",
