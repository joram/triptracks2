  "description": "Developed for optimal temperature control, the light and compressible Aenergy Hybrid insulated jacket is designed for mountain activities in cold conditions. Wear it as a warm layer under a hardshell or on its own as an outer layer. The unique Octa filling is made of 100% recycled material on the front, shoulders and sleeves, striking the right balance between warmth and breathability. The material provides excellent insulation even when wet while also allowing excess heat to dissipate for optimum temperature regulation. This makes it suitable for a large temperature range, without having to take layers on or off. It combines a lightweight wind-resistant fabric with equally wind-resistant, light panels made of stretchy storm fleece with waffle structure for better freedom of movement and breathability. The Aenergy Hybrid is your go-to for demanding activities in cold conditions.",
