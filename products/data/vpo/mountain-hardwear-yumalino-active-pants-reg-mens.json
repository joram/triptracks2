  "description": "The perfect pant to help fight the frigid days of fall, keeping you warm even through the winter. Its tapered fit with an adjustable ankle hem is easy to pair with any footwear, whether for the cabin or through the snow, and its unique, hidden belt system wears smoothly under an insulated jacket or with baselayers. With a softshell exterior that resists inclement weather, backed with ultra-soft fleece that comforts skin as it brushes through movement, the Yumalino dares to brave the cold, so you can accomplish more in the freezing seasons.",
