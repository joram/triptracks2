  "description": "Lightweight short-sleeved t-shirt in a soft jersey knit made from merino wool and polyester. Combines the temperature-regulating properties of wool with the durability and moisture-wicking properties of synthetic fibres. A perfect first layer in both warm and cold climates, and extra useful on multiday trips due to wool's natural resistance to bad odours.",
