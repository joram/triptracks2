  "description": "The Coldfront LT Down Hoodie is the lightest and most packable down jacket in the Outdoor Research line, making it the perfect piece for alpine starts and summit pushes. This piece is made with 100% recycled polyester and features RDS-approved 700+ fill power-down insulation, making it a responsible choice for the environmentally conscious adventurer. Pertex\u00ae Quantum fabric protects you from the wind and water while allowing the down insulation to fully loft, trapping heat to keep you comfortable in colder temperatures. The hood adds an extra layer of protection from the elements, and the minimalist design makes this hoodie perfect for layering under a shell or over a base layer. Ideal for active cold-weather pursuits when the temperature plunges below freezing, the Coldfront LT Down Hoodie is a lightweight winter necessity.",
