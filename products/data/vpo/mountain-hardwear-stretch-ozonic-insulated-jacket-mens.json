  "description": "For those late-season trail treks and high alpine backpacking trips where weather and temps are all but certain, the Insulated Stretch Ozonic Jacket takes Mountain Hardwear's best-selling shell and adds synthetic stretch insulation for an added edge in variable conditions. The 100% recycled waterproof shell fabric is fully taped to keep afternoon storms at bay, and the stretch-woven lining moves with you and wicks moisture when you're on the go.",
