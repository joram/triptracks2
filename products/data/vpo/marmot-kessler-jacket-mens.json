  "description": "Hiking a spongy forest or pedaling home on a rainy night? The Men's Kessler Jacket has got your back. GORE-TEX 3L Active fabric is lightweight and breathable, yet easily stuffs into the bottom of your pack or panier so you can forget about it until a storm crops up. 100% seam taping keeps leaks out, while the adjustable helmet-compatible hood gives extra coverage when you need it. Open up the heat-releasing PitZips when the pace picks up.",
