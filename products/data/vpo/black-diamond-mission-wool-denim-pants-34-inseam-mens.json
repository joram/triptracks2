  "description": "One of the best things about climbing is that you can still send in a pair of jeans. And now, thanks to Black Diamond\u2019s Performance Wool Denim, when the temps drop, you can keep \u2018em on and not freeze.<br><br>Featuring a unique blend of cotton and certified non-mulesed wool, these jeans are like wolves in sheep\u2019s clothing (pun intended) and maintain that cool Sharma style. Cut for mobility, the articulated knees combined with comfort stretch fabric allows for execution of tricky drop knees and high stepping, all while adding an increased level of warmth thanks to the wool. The fabric is treated with a DWR for added protection and each pocket placement is harness compatible.",
