  "description": "From horizontal trails to vertical cracks, the ultralight and ultra-packable Kor AirShell\u2122 Full Zip Jacket serves up Goldilocks-grade protection when you're moving fast in cool, blustery conditions. With a redesigned construction for improved fit, this durable yet super-breathable jacket rebuffs light moisture and chilly gusts thanks to its Pertex\u00ae Quantum Air fabric, and stows in its internal pocket. Call it an ultralight softshell or a super breathable wind shirt, but they just call it the do-it-all stretch layer that never leaves Mountain Hardwear's pack.",
