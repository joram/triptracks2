  "description": "&lt;p&gt;The seventh edition of a classic \u2013 optimized even further thanks to feedback from outdoor enthusiasts like you. The Ultimate VII Hooded is a technical soft shell jacket with a hood for hiking, trekking and mountaineering. Developed exclusively with Gore-Tex\u00ae, the 3-layer material is windproof, robust and breathable. The water-repellent treatment is PFC-free and both the outer material and reverse of the fabric are made from 100% recycled polyester. Thanks to internal drawstrings for adjustment, the hood with a reinforced peak provides reliable protection from wind and rain. The many practical features are ideal for your mountain adventures: drawstring to adjust the hem width, two side pockets and a concealed chest pocket with zippers, as well as a flap behind the front zipper to keep out wind and rain. The new edition of the Mammut Ultimate classic is once again setting standards \u2013 with environmentally friendly technical materials.&lt;/p&gt;",
