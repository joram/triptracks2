  "description": "You can only scope your line if you can see where you're going. Putting on the Smith I/O MAG\u2122 goggles is like flipping the switch from regular to widescreen. Their ChromaPop\u2122 lens tech boosts color and contrast, so every wind lip, landing, and tree glade is as sharp as possible. It gets their highest level of anti-fog treatment and integrates with their helmets for airflow that keeps them fog-free through all weather conditions. Whether the day dawns clear or stormy, lens swaps are a snap thanks to our quick-swap MAG\u2122 lens system. Compatible only with lenses from 20/21 production season. Not compatible with lenses 19/20 or earlier.",
