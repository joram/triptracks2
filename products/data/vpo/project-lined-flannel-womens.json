  "description": "The Lined Project Flannel is the ideal layer for crisp climbing conditions, whether its worn solo, over a hoody for added warmth. Constructed with a brushed organic cotton outer layer and a cozy, recycled polyester sherpa fleece lining, this is the most insulated flannel in the line. Nylon lining in the sleeves and a boxy fit makes it easy to wear with other bulky layers. Additional features include easy to operate snap closure and a single front chest pocket.",
