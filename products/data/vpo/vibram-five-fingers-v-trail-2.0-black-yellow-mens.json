  "description": "The V-Trail 2.0 offers the latest and greatest features to conquer trails with ease, including both lamination around the toes to prevent seam splitting and improved upper material which is more water repellent than the previous version. The V-Trail 2.0 features 3D Cocoon mesh woven into the outsole for protection from sharper objects during outdoor training like rocks, roots and acorns. The mesh is tridimensional, it disperses the point of impact across the full bottom of the shoe. Continues to offer excellent proprioception and dexterity. The Megagrip outsole compound offers supreme grip across both wet and dry conditions.",
