  "description": "Light, breathable and perfect for mountain adventures of all kinds, the Hike Long Sleeve Top features a stylish design that does double duty for more casual explorations around town. Made with a soft and naturally odour-resistant merino jersey body fabric that helps regulate body temperature, this top also features panels of abrasion-resistant merino cotton canvas and a double-layer back yoke for rugged durability. The front snap-button closure makes for easy on and off, while gusseted underarms provide maximum range of motion. <br><br>Inspired by nature, icebreaker harnesses the performance qualities of natural fibres to offer an alternative to clothing based on petrochemical synthetics. Merino is an annually renewable fibre that naturally resists odours, keeps you cool when it\u2019s hot and warm when it\u2019s not, and lets your skin breathe for comfort all day, every day.",
