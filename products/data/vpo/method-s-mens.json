  "description": "The Method S is designed for steep climbing. A soft midsole, downturned last, and rubberized toe box makes heel hooks and toe hooks feel like second nature, while the single Velcro strap provides easy transitions between burns. Molded sticky rubber soles are optimized for grip without sacrificing performance or weight. An engineered knit upper makes the Method S breathable and comfortable next to the skin. Women\u2019s specific design incorporates a low-volume last.",
