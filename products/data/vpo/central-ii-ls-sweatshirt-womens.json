  "description": "The Central II Long Sleeve Sweatshirt is an ultra-comfy everyday pullover made from a blend of soft organically grown cotton and breathable, odour-resistant merino wool. The ribbed neck, cuffs and hem provide a classic sweater finish to this stylish top. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Inspired by nature, Icebreaker harnesses the performance qualities of natural fibres to offer an alternative to clothing based on petrochemical synthetics. Merino is an annually renewable fibre that naturally resists odours, keeps you cool when it\u2019s hot and warm when it\u2019s not, and lets your skin breathe for comfort all day, every day.",
