  "description": "&lt;p&gt;The smallest silhouette in the Sportlite Series, the Sportlite 15 is perfect for small day hikes and excursions. Its minimal design is simple to use, with a slimmed-down feature set that provides just what you need and nothing more in a sustainably designed package. Despite its unassuming appearance, it still features an AirScape\u00ae backpanel that keeps this pack dynamic and comfortable, wherever your day may take you.&lt;/p&gt;",
