  "description": "Inspired by the steep, remote rock walls of southern Jordan, the new Wadi Rum Collection includes feature-packed pieces that fit in just as nicely on the crux of a climb as they do in the director's chair. Purpose-built for climbing and detailed for trail-to-town versatility, the Wadi Rum Pants and Shorts use a durable Cordura nylon, spandex, and cotton blend to match the real-world ruggedness of the Middle Eastern routes from which they were named. A gusseted crotch adds extra mobility, while a standard fit and lightweight construction keeps the wearer cool and comfortable with whatever the next pitch throws their way.",
