  "description": "Fold the Men's Bantamweight Jacket into its own pocket, stuff it in the bottom of your bag and you'll never need to wonder if you should grab an umbrella on your way out the door again. This superlight (6 oz.) jacket has a trim profile but is still fully leveled up with stretchy Pertex\u00ae Shield. Pull on the hood for extra coverage and adjust the drawcord hem when cold.",
