  "description": "This core-warming jacket combines recycled polyester insulation and repurposed taffeta for reversible and convenient color-blocked protection. Wear it fall through spring\u2014around town or far from it. <br><br>The C\u00e1lido brings the heat, but it also stows and deploys at a moment\u2019s notice: Pack it into its own chest pocket and whip it out when the temperature drops. Elastic binding on hem and cuffs keeps the warmth in, and two pockets on both sides of the jacket keep your hands toasty.",
