  "description": "<p>The new edition of a popular classic. From a relaxed hike to a demanding multi-day tour, with the Runbold you\u2019ll feel good on all distances. The polyamide and spandex material mix is very robust, feels pleasant to wear and allows you to move freely. The miDori fiber finish improves moisture-wicking and ensures the pants dry faster. The waistband can be adjusted for a perfect fit. Thanks to four zippered pockets, essentials are always close to hand. What\u2019s more, the Runbold take up so little space you can take them with you wherever you go.</p>",
