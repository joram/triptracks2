  "description": "Ideal for cold-weather running and training, or relaxing after a long, chilly day outside, the Shifter Pants combine the style of classic jogger sweatpants with their terry corespun fabric\u2014nylon fibers wrapped in merino wool and blended with LYCRA\u00ae for the ultimate combination of durability, stretch, and next-to-skin softness. A modern tapered leg opening with ribbed leg cuffs offers a unique look.\n\nInspired by nature, icebreaker harnesses the performance qualities of natural fibers to offer an alternative to clothing based on petrochemical synthetics. Merino is an annually renewable fiber that naturally resists odors, keeps you cool when it\u2019s hot and warm when it\u2019s not, and lets your skin breathe for comfort all day, every day.",
