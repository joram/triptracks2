  "description": "The Meron Hooded Jacket is a lightweight, extra-warm insulated jacket that won\u2019t let you down in sub-zero temperatures. The combination of ultra-light, tear-proof and abrasion-proof ripstop nylon and premium-quality goose down filling provides an excellent warmth-to-weight ratio. The jacket is compressible and can be stowed in its own side pocket. To top it all off, it has a helmet-compatible hood, backpack-friendly side pockets and other useful features. Put on the Meron when belaying your climbing partner, after you\u2019ve reached your ski touring summit or in any other situation where freezing is definitely not an option.",
