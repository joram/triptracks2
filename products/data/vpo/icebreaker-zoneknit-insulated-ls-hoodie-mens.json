  "description": "The ZoneKnit\u2122 Insulated Long Sleeve Hoodie is a high-performance merino wool midlayer optimized for intense activity and technical mountain pursuits. This warm yet highly breathable hoodie features icebreaker\u2019s ZoneKnit engineered body mapping, which combines merino jersey fabric with strategic panels of merino eyelet mesh to enhance airflow and temperature regulation. On the chest, a panel of MerinoLoft\u2122 insulation, a natural and cruelty-free merino fill, adds key core warmth where it\u2019s needed most. The balaclava hood increases protection, while underarm gussets and raglan sleeves provide uninhibited range of motion. <br><br>Inspired by nature, icebreaker harnesses the performance qualities of natural fibers to offer an alternative to clothing based on petrochemical synthetics. Merino is an annually renewable fiber that naturally resists odors, keeps you cool when it\u2019s hot and warm when it\u2019s not, and lets your skin breathe for comfort all day, every day.",
