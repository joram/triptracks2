  "description": "Button-up flannels are the classic outdoor style for good reason, and the Voyager One\u2122 Shirt keeps that tradition going strong while reinventing new standards that help protect the places we wear it in. Recycled polyester adds a hint of stretch for evenings above the crash pad and biking around town on the cusp of summer and fall. But unlike other flannels, this one requires less water to make, so we can enjoy the outdoors more responsibly.",
