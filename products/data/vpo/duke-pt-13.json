  "description": "The new Duke PT 13 with a DIN 4-13 combines the performance of a Griffon with comfortable uphill properties of a pin binding. An absolute highlight is the innovative Ride &amp; Hike toe. For walking mode the upper part is simply unlocked and tilted forward, uncovering the pin binding. To save swing weight the upper jaw part can be taken off and stored in a backpack. The multi functional Lock &amp; Walk unit automatically locks the brakes and provides a 10\u00b0 climbing aid. For downhill mode the front jaw section is clicked back onto the base plate, quadruple secured by the Auto Quad Lock technology. Now the toe piece works just like an alpine toe with all of its advantages! The heel is the latest generation of Inter Pivot heels. The low height of 24 mm allows for direct power transmission and fast edge changes. Thanks to Multinorm all Duke PT are compatible to alpine, touring and GripWalk boots.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;",
