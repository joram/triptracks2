  "description": "A regular fit with full-length AquaGuard\u00ae leg zips means you can pull them on over bulky walking boots the moment the weather turns. An internal top popper then allows you to vent fast if conditions become excessively warm or humid.<br><br>Weather protection is provided by&nbsp;lightweight but durable 2.5-Layer Pertex\u00ae Shield with a recycled face fabric. With 2.5 layers, it is softer and more supple than a traditional 3-layer shell, making it extremely comfortable to wear, as well as lightweight and compact when strapped to your pack or stowed in a pocket.<br><br>Breathable, waterproof and windproof, with an articulated knee, a half-elasticated waist and a drawcord-adjustable hem, these are easy-stash, effective waterproof trousers for a wide range of mountain activities.",
