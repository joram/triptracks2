  "description": "The thermal efficiency of a mitten in a design for big mountain freeride, the Sabre delivers warmth and protection with grip and dexterity. Designed with a low-profile bonded cuff for easy layering, its weather protection comes from a breathable, anatomically-shaped GORE-TEX insert that seals out wet, wind, and snow. A Fortius\u2122 1.0 softshell outer provides abrasion resistance and stretch performance, leather palm reinforcements up durability, and two types of PrimaLoft\u2122 insulation provide warmth.",
