  "description": "The Varden ski sweater is a light and soft piece made with fine merino wool mixed with some nylon and elastane to help it keep the shape. The design is inspired by the ski sweaters in the 70s, with color blocked details on the sleeve and finished with our silicone badge. Wear it as a mid-layer for the slopes, or straight on your skin. Made in ITALY.",
