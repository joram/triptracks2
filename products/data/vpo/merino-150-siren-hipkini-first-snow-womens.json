  "description": "Ultra-comfy underwear bottoms for everyday wear, the 150 Siren Hipkini First Snow features lightweight Corespun jersey merino fabric that\u2019s durable, stretchy, and incredibly soft. The low-profile elastic waist and leg openings offer a great fit, and the low-profile side seams maximize comfort. The unique winter pattern draws inspiration from the angular, crystalline shapes of snowflakes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Inspired by nature, icebreaker harnesses the performance qualities of natural fibres to offer an alternative to clothing based on petrochemical synthetics. Merino is an annually renewable fibre that naturally resists odours, keeps you cool when it\u2019s hot and warm when it\u2019s not, and lets your skin breathe for comfort all day, every day.",
