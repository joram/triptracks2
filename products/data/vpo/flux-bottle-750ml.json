  "description": "Flexible bottles get an upgrade. The Flux is shaped like a hard bottle, compresses like a softflask, and cuts weight by 50%. Topped with a dust cover and twist-drink nozzle for grab-and-go hydration, plus a bail handle to keep hydration secure in your hand or on your pack. The Flux stands upright like a hard bottle but when you finish your drink, this bottle packs down to pocket size.",
