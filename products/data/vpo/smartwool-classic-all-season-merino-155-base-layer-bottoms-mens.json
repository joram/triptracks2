  "description": "They've updated the fit in our year-round Classic All-Season Merino Base Layer Bottom to improve functionality while enhancing aesthetics. Ultra-smooth Merino helps regulate body temperature, breathes well, and naturally resists odors. What else do you need in a base layer? How about smooth flatlock seams to help minimize chafing and a wide, fabric-covered waistband? With our Core Spun technology, we've wrapped Merino around a nylon core for added durability while still keeping the comfort of ultra-soft Merino next to skin. It's everything you need and more to adventure all year long.",
