  "description": "Add a hood to our beloved Olden jacket, and you're ready for epic outdoor adventure. You'll find yourself reaching for this zippered hoody from chilly late-summer nights all the way through spring ski season. Wear it as stretchy, moisture-wicking outerwear while training for your cold-weather marathon or grab your shell and board and use it as a soft, breathable midlayer for days carving up that fresh powder. Earned yourself an off-day? The Olden also shines as comfy loungewear when staying in and chilling hard are on the agenda",
