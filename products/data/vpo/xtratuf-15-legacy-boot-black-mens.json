  "description": "The Legacy Boot is available in Black for the very first time! An Alaskan staple in the commercial fishing industry, the Legacy Boot provides commercial fishermen flexible, all-day comfort and the best protection against the broadest range of acids, corrosives, and contaminants. Each boot is made with XTRATUF\u2019s signature triple dipping technique, which creates a seamless barrier that is highly resistant to many organic and inorganic acids, chemicals and contaminants. <br><br>The latex neoprene is ozone resistant, and is softer, lighter, and far more pliable than ordinary rubber. This pliability is what has made XTRATUF the leading choice for numerous commercial fisherman as it allows sneaker like agility while providing total waterproof protection and slip-resistance. Cushioned insoles with arch support help fight fatigue and stress on the legs and back.",
