  "description": "High-performance features and stylish finishes come together in the lightweight Men's Sailfish Short-Sleeve Shirt. Suitable for your pre-, mid-, and post-dockside adventure, the quick-drying fabric keeps you comfortable on land and at sea. Vents at the back increase breathability. Built-in UPF-50 sun protection shields your skin from dangerous rays during long days on the water. Offset shoulder seams and flatlock seams reduce irritation and chafing. Small features make a big impact like the chamois patch that cleans your shades, a 3-height adjustable collar, and mesh-lined pockets with VELCRO\u00ae closures.",
