  "description": "Versatile tights you can wear under hardshell pants when skiing, mountaineering or even on their own when hiking. The combination of two high-quality fleece fabrics provides for optimal temperature regulation. The main fabric made of Polartec\u00ae Power Stretch\u00ae Pro material is comfortable, extra durable and incredibly stretchy. The lower leg section is made with Polartec\u00ae Power Grid\u2122 fleece for excellent moisture management and less volume. The tights fit perfectly thanks to the elastic waistband. They are made to offer superior quality and are extremely durable. Now in its third generation, the Aconcagua family still holds its own on expeditions, long and short outdoor adventures and is also suitable for everyday wear.",
