  "description": "The beast. With its minimalist look, the Furtis is a tremendous mountain companion for skiers who want a light and strong pole. Built on a 22mm diameter tube, 100% composite, it is very durable and ultra-light thanks to an inconspicuously elastic structure, capable of absorbing impacts. The Furtis also benefits from a long, slimmed-down top grip for easy handling and a harness-inspired hand strap attached to a sturdy cap. It is also fitted with a flexible basket which adapts perfectly to the variations of the terrain.",
