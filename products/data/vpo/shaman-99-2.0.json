  "description": "It\u2019s back! The Shaman 2.0 is the revamped version of one of Icelantic\u2019s most iconic skis: the Shaman. We took components of the original Shaman design and integrated updated technology, materials, and profile shape to create a lively, more forgiving, and most importantly, fun ski.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Shaman 2.0 99 is perfect for individuals seeking to carve deeply and dominate frontside turns while having versatility to perform all over the mountain. The more narrow version of the Shaman 2.0, the 99 is quicker edge to edge than its wider counterpart \u2013 the Shaman 2.0 110. Boasting 8mm of camber underfoot and a tight turning radius, the Shaman 2.0 99 gives the ski a lively rebound that accelerates you in and out of turns with ease.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Its tapered shape, wide shovel, and rockered tip and tail, allows you to stay in the front of your boot, driving the ski through any condition the mountain provides, never having the tip dive in even the deepest snow. Whether you are a longtime Shaman skier or someone who is interested in a ride unlike anything you have ever felt before, get on a pair and you won\u2019t be disappointed!",
