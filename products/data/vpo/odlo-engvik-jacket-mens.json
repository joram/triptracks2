  "description": "Engvik - a small town on Norway's west coast - is known for cold harsh weather. Apt then that we borrow its' name for this beautifully conceived cross-country jacket. The windproof fabric cuts through conditions like a knife, while the jacket's lightweight construction, crafted with a rear laser cut jersey insert, is one of many appreciable performance details you'll notice when moving. The perfect outer layer when working hard on the skis is the order of the day.",
