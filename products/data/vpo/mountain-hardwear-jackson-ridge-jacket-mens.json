  "description": "Ever-expansive thickets, foxtails, burrs, and everything else that sticks and threatens to rip has got nothing on the Jackson Ridge\u2122 Jacket. Durable cotton canvas is up to every campground challenge\u2014from cutting and carrying wood to sitting on root-riddled dirt. With insulating warmth and sherpa fleece lining in the hood, we upgraded the classic fit, raising the neckline, repositioning the pockets just-so, and adding an adjustable cinch hem to keep the fit functional yet flattering. Warm on its own, layer it up with your favorite flannel to bring the heritage vibe home.",
