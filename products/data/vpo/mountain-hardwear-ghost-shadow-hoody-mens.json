  "description": "A hoody is supposed to keep you warm. (Surprise\u2014this one does!) But what about one that won't heat up the atmosphere? We think this flying space rock is pretty awesome, and because we want to keep Earth awesome, we made a jacket that uses trash instead of making more. With recycled materials from its synthetic insulation to the face fabric and liner, this hoody brings the heat where it's supposed to.",
