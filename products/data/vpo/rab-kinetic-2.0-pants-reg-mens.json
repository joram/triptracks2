  "description": "The Kinetic 2.0 Pant is great for changeable conditions when sporadic showers and strenuous activities are the order of the day. Constructed from 3-layer Proflex\u2122 Kinetic 2.0 fabric, it uses an internal PU membrane, sandwiched between a durable nylon woven outer and a soft, fast-wicking inner. While that delivers outstanding stretch and breathability for fast-paced scrambles, the slim, athletic cut offers extra usability thanks to expandable cuffs for larger boots and articulated knees for easy movement.<br><br>The adjustable elasticated waist uses a secure silicon grip and the ankles and hem use heavier woven reinforcements to increase durability. With waterproofing of 20000mm HH and breathability of up to 20000g MVTR, the Kinetic 2.0 Pant blends the protection of a hardshell with the comfort of a softshell for outstanding all-day practicality.",
