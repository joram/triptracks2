  "description": "Welcome to the new generation of mountaineering boots. Weighing in at just 555 grams, this is the lightest crampon-compatible mountaineering boot on the market. In alpine terrain, our focus is lightness, durability and performance. The Taiss Light Mid GTX brings these features together with an unrivalled array of materials and technology. Without compromising on dampening, our developers have reduced the thickness of the Vibram sole to optimize feel. And thanks to the rigid, carbon-fiber midsole, you can expect the same high performance response and control synonymous with the Taiss. Georganic 3D technology ensures enhanced comfort, with all parts of the boot in contact with the foot designed for specific anatomical features. The elasticated mono-tongue construction helps relieve pressure points on the top of the foot.",
