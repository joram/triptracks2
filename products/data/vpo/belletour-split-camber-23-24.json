  "description": "The newly updated BelleTour was developed for high peaks, big lines, pillow popping, and everything in between. This application of our biobased Algal Core and Algal Wall in a split provides symbiosis between you and your big mountain pursuits. A wider waist, slight swallowtail, and medium sidecut integrate to create a shape that floats and planes as well as it pivots. Designed to optimize stiffness and performance for both touring and descending, you\u2019ll be tagging lines no matter the conditions.",
