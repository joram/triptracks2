  "description": "Your youngins can now hang tough with the big boys and girls on cold family outings from the city park to the bunny slope. Big puffy 700-fill down baffles will keep your little ones super warm for maximum blanket wrapped comfort and minimum complaints to mom and dad on freezing days outside. No party fouls for spilled hot chocolate or inevitable face plants learning how to shred, Down Defender ensures your kids stay warm even when their puffer gets a little wet. For a cherry on top, the Guides Hoody packs down super small so you can easily pack it just in case your kids get cold when the sun or temps start dropping.",
