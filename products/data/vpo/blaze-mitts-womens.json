The stretchiness of the water-resistant FLEXSHELL fabric allows your hands to move freely during any activity. Naturally moisture-wicking and antimicrobial, the wool-blend lining guarantees comfort at all times. The addition of our PRIMALOFT\u00ae Gold P.U.R.E.\u2122 recycled, breathable, and water-resistant insulation offers the perfect level of warmth for alpine skiing, even when the heating element is not activated. Plus, the premium goatskin palm with PRIMALOFT\u00ae Eco Gold Grip Control makes having a firm grip on your gear a breeze.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Blaze women\u2019s mitts rank 4 on our warmth level scale.",
