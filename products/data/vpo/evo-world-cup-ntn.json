  "description": "The Telemark revolution bears from the concept of a product of extraordinary performances. Shell and Cuff in Pebax\u00ae with micrometrical buckles for a high-level fitting; the rear mechanism for a quick change from Walk to Ski mode. Maximum skiing stability thanks to the \u201cCarbon Side Support\u201d system exclusively patented by CRISPI\u00ae. The revolutionary cuff with double density injection gives rigidity and support; the special \u201cBellow Flex Control\u201d allows an outstanding flexion. Available with CRISPI\u00ae Dynamic Liner (Thermoformable).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Compatible with NTN and Low Tech binding. Crispi are the only telelmark boot manufacturer to include tech inserts at the toe and heel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;***Note: with all Crispi NTN boots\u2013 the distance between the tech toe pins and the back of the NTN \u201cheel\u201d is slightly shorter than on Scarpa boots, and this means the smaller boot sizes are prone to pre-releasing from the small sized Meidjo binding. For this reason, we do not recommend using Crispi boots with the small size Meidjo binding (mondo size 26 or smaller). The large binding does not have the same problem.",
