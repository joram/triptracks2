  "description": "Modern styling, light and multifunctional \u2013 the Blueridge Low ES is a lightweight hiking shoe for a range of uses, loaded with innovative sustainability features. Such as the use of durable, highest-quality Perwanger leather for the upper, or the `Global Recycling Standard\u00b4100% recycled fabric element of the upper, and the PFC-free waterproof membrane. <br><br>Waterproof, breathable, sustainable \u2013 HANWAG designed its proprietary PU membrane based on a complex, hydrophilic system that achieves waterproofing and breathability without the use of fluorocarbons. This is applied in a sturdy three-layer laminate. All materials are sourced from European suppliers and the shoe is made entirely in Europe. But durability and sustainability don\u2019t have to come at the cost of functionality and comfort. And the Blueridge Low ES\u2019s perfect fit and newly developed midsole proves it! <br><br>The raised edge of the sole made of stabilising PU offers greater support on all sides and at the heel. With a non-slip \u2018Terragrip\u2019 outsole with four-millimetre-deep tread, extra-large lugs and wider contact area, the heel strike and roll-off performance are effortless and smooth. This makes the modern-styled Blueridge Low ES at home on a range of hiking trails \u2013 from damp, autumnal foothills through to sandy, Mediterranean coastal hikes.<br><br>*** All Hanwag boots are sold under UK sizing - Please see size chart for details/conversion",
