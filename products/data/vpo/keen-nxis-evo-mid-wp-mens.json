  "description": "What the makers of Keen love most about hiking fast is experiencing more things. More sunrises from the overlook, more high fives at the summit, more post-hike tea with friends back at the parking lot. And more terrain \u2014 asphalt to trail to scree to stone steps. So they took the room-for-your-toes comfort, protection, and stability of their iconic hiker and gave it a running shoe feel with a waterproof, engineered knit upper and all-terrain tread.",
