  "description": "Elastic and lightweight, yet robust: thanks to its durable merino yarn, the 120 Tec Fast Mountain top for men is ready for steep walls and rugged summits. Thanks to its snug, athletic cut and the elastic material mix of 85% Merino Wool and 15% Polyamide, the 120 Tec Fast Mountain top for men provides maximum freedom of movement \u2013 during even the most demanding of maneuvers. But the casual top not only cuts a fine figure while climbing \u2013 thanks to its unbeatable material characteristics, this multi-talented piece also shines while mountaineering, high alpine touring, ski touring or freeriding. The tried-and-tested yarn composition guarantees the necessary durability: innovative corespun technology by \u00a9 Su\u00a8dwolle group makes the fabric extremely thin, lightweight and elastic, yet sturdy and thus very durable. The finest 17.5 micron fibers make it comfortable on the skin, while merino wool reliably regulates temperature and moisture. The 120 Tec fast mountain top for men is therefore the perfect companion for all alpine adventures.",
