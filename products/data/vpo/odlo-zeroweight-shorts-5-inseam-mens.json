  "description": "You breathe deep waiting for the light to change. The last 4k was tough. The next stretch, even more difficult. Tailored to the specific demands of exacting runners, and designed to be worn overtop an active sport liner, the ODLO Zeroweight 5 inch running short was crafted with performance running in mind. Made from recycled 4-way stretch fabric, they are shorts that shift with your pace - fluid and weightless when you need them to be and lightweight and beautifully vented during every sprint.<br><br>Why they made it: Training, Running",
