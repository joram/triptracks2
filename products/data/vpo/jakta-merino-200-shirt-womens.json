  "description": "Warm, soft and insulating base layer, with a flattering fit. knitted with a thread that makes the garment extra shiny. Made from 100% fine merino wool in 18.7 micron - which makes it exceptionally comfortable and soft against the skin, The natural Merino properties provide high moisture transport, great breathability and will make it naturally odor resistant. Somewhat heavier than its little sister Breeze, which in turn makes this baselayer more robust, the colors more solid and the fit more relaxed. Made for hiking adventures - but also blends well into a more urban scene. Care for the environment by washing your clothes less often, these garments will clean themselves by hanging them out to air.",
