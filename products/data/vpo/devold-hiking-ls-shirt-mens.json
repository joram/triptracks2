  "description": "Devold\u00ae Hiking are soft, lightweight garments knitted in 100% fine Merino wool. This quality has good insulation properties and excellent breathability. Besides wool's natural regulation of body temperature after activity, Hiking has strategically placed mesh panels to ensure optimum ventilation properties. Flat seams and side panels offer optimum comfort for rucksack carriers, for example, and the garments fit closely and snugly to the body. This is the year-round favourite that's perfect for any outdoor activity \u2013 whether it's hiking, kajaking, climbing, cycling or snow sports.",
