  "description": "The Salt Polo is made of fine, soft Merino yarn, mixed with some Creora-Eco-Soft. The shape of the polo is a classic, straight fit with a sporty look. Use it for layering during Summer, or as a basic piece on it`s own. The great thing about Merino wool is that you don`t have to wash it very often. Just hang it up for airing after each use, and it will feel fresh for the day after. This is a great staple for your wardrobe, all year!",
