  "description": "An ultralight wind barrier, the Black Diamond Alpine Light Pant is the three- season solution for lightweight weather protection. Designed with a single- weave, four-way stretch fabric, they pack down so you can shove them deep into the recesses of your pack, and the DWR treated finish gives you a layer of shelter when light precip rolls in. Two front drop-in pockets and one in back plus a zip thigh pocket for stashing essentials. Fit can be finetuned with cordlock adjustable hems and easy-to-adjust integrated webbing belt.",
