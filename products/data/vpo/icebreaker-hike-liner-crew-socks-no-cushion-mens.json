  "description": "The Hike Liner Crew socks are ultralight and versatile socks for super-hot conditions or for pairing with a heavier sock. The uncushioned, quick-drying design is anatomically sculpted for premium fit and comfort, with key support zones in the Achilles and instep. Reinforcements in the heels and toes increase durability, while the seamless toes reduce bulk and prevent blisters.<br><br>Inspired by nature, Icebreaker harnesses the performance qualities of natural fibres to offer an alternative to clothing based on petrochemical synthetics. Merino is an annually renewable fibre that naturally resists odours, keeps you cool when it\u2019s hot and warm when it\u2019s not, and lets your skin breathe for comfort all day, every day.",
