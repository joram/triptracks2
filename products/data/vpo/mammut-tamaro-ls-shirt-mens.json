  "description": "A classic flannel with a modern edge, this relaxed fit button-up works just as well solo as it does as a light fall jacket or midlayer. The magic is in the fabric: this blend of natural and synthetic fibers combines durable, thermo-regulating hemp to keep odors at bay with sweat-wicking and fast-drying recycled polyester. An essential outdoor staple with just the right touch of ruggedness.",
