  "description": "The commercial grade version of the Ankle Deck Boot fishermen have been asking for. Standing for 12+ hours a day on the sea can cause feet to swell, and the wider fit of this boot is built for that. The upper is reinforced in high wear areas such as the toe and heel for maximum durability. The boot features an EVA/PU blend insole for all-day comfort, and an oil resistant, SRC-rated outsole for the best traction available.",
