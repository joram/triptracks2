  "description": "The V-Trek Insulated keeps your feet warm, even as the temperatures drop. With a 360\u00b0 fleece lining for warmth, and a non-absorbent water shedding shell that wicks away light moisture, it\u2019s designed to keep you exploring in all conditions. It\u2019s more comfortable and flexible than previous insulated FiveFingers, due to the brushed toe fabric and soft fleece lined collar, tongue and quarter panels. It features a protective film on top of and in between the toes for added protection, while water shedding is facilitated by the non-absorbent Hypatex overlay braces.",
