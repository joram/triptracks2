  "description": "The Corsa is a hyperlight ice axe designed for glacier travel and ski mountaineering. The aluminum alloy construction is lightweight, but still rated in accordance with EN 13089 Type 1 for use as a snow anchor and self-arrest. A lightweight nylon spike plug keeps snow out of the shaft. The grip is machined for good handling and a small slot in the head allows for seamless integration with the Corsa leash (sold separately). Not suitable for use on vertical ice, mixed terrain or for intense step chipping.",
