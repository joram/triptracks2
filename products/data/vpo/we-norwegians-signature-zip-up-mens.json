  "description": "For this season, we have reworked the Setesdal base layer to a fully fashioned piece, with the same signature pattern. The yarns used for this line is still from S\u00fcdwolle, the soft, comfortable quality that can be worn next to skin without itching. We have added ribbed details in the sides and the shape is body hugging and sharp. A classic ski sweater that is timeless and with a touch of Norwegian heritage.",
