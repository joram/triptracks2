  "description": "The Falketind Gore-Tex Pants are their most versatile waterproof, windproof and breathable pants made for all-season use. They're light enough to be used in the summer use and durable enough for winter adventures. These pants are developed for all kinds of mountaineering activities, wide enough to fit randonee boots and tight enough for crampon use. Made of a special developed recycled 40D Gore-Tex fabric they hit the sweetspot between all-year versatility and great protection. <br><br>The slightly brushed and comfortable backer has a smooth and even finish which feels comfortable next to skin. Critical features such as Custom- fit waist system, \u00be side zips, inside gaiter hook, reinforced inside leg and thigh pocket.",
