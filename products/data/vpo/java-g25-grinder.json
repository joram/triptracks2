  "description": "Meet the world\u2019s finest hand coffee grinder. Sure, they're biased, but where else will you find ultra-durable military grade aluminum and stainless-steel materials incorporated in a fastidiously engineered unit purpose built for adventure? The push-release top cap allows quick access to the bean hopper. The grind handle retracts for double duty as a carabiner handle. The grinder knob threads to attach within the catch when not in use. Perhaps most importantly, the conical burr and dual bearings provide the most consistent grind size of any hand-grinder on the market. It\u2019s 50 grind setting ensure you can dial in the right size and consistency to achieve the best cup of coffee anywhere and everywhere. Bonus: it\u2019s sized to integrate perfectly with their Nest Pour Over Kit and the AeroPress Go.",
