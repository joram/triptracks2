  "description": "Blending responsibly sourced, water-resistant goose down with a streamlined design, Cotopaxi's Fuego Vest is the perfect outer layer and midlayer in one. They love it for those in-between weather days that don\u2019t quite warrant a jacket, and it\u2019s also great as a core-warming layer under a shell while skiing. There\u2019s an adjustable drawcord at the hem, along with two zippered hand pockets and two interior stash pockets. Their latest Fuego Vest also features an updated fit, with a little more breathing room in the hips, chest, and waist.",
