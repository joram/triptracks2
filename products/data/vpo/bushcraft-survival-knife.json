  "description": "A sturdy member of the Bushcraft family, this is one of our most robust knives due to its black, 3.2 mm thick blade. The blade is made of carbon steel that we\u2019ve hardened to optimal strength, making the Bushcraft Black extremely resistant under pressure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The ergonomic polymer handle has a soft friction grip, finger guard and a 3.2 mm thick carbon steel blade, providing both strength and stability in every cut. The black DLC-coating provides some protection against rust and prevents reflections on the blade. Thanks to the blade and handle design, the knife is ideal for working safely and efficiently in various weather conditions all year. The polymer sheath has a practical belt clip, a belt loop and is equipped with integrated fire starter and diamond sharpener. It\u2019s always ready, willing, and able to take on unexpected challenges. Carbon steel rusts, so wipe and oil the blade after use.",
