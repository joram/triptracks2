  "description": "The Quantum Hybrid Long Sleeve Zip Hoodie takes icebreaker's tried and true technical midlayer to the next level with the addition of plant-based Lyoloft insulation in the chest area for added warmth. The main body fabric features 100% merino terry fabric that naturally insulates, breathes and regulates temperature on cold-weather alpine pursuits. The fitted hood adds warmth and fits under a helmet, while the alpine zippered hand pockets remain accessible while wearing a harness. Offset shoulder seams reduce friction while wearing a pack, and raglan sleeves improve range of motion. <br><br>Inspired by nature, icebreaker harnesses the performance qualities of natural fibres to offer an alternative to clothing based on petrochemical synthetics. Merino is an annually renewable fibre that naturally resists odours, keeps you cool when it\u2019s hot and warm when it\u2019s not, and lets your skin breathe for comfort all day, every day.",
