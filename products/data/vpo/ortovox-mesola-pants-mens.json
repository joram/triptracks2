  "description": "When the path to the best runs requires an ascent with climbing skins, the Mesola line is completely in its element. With their innovative material and style concept, the casual-cut mesola jackets and pants provide exactly the performance that the relevant body parts require: in very exposed areas, merino deep shell material with the high-performance Dermizax\u00ae NX membrane provides reliable protection from the elements. <br><br>Less exposed areas contain merino airsolation softshell material, which is not only soft, breathable and wind- and water-resistant, but also provides huge freedom of movement. Fine merino wool on the inside makes them exceptionally comfortable. Generous ventilation zippers, adjustable waistband and ankle cuffs and spacious pockets contribute to the line\u2019s general comfort and high functionality. Made for freeriders who give their all, even during ascents.",
