  "description": "This highly functional midlayer is made with RDS 2.0 850 down fill and a lightweight down-proof recycled 10D nylon face. With a full zip solution, these pants can easily be put on and taken off without removing your ski boots, either on top or underneath your shell pants. The pants are easy to compress down and can be packed into a tiny, separate bag. The zippers on the side are coordinated so you will not use valuable time trying to match them up and the Custom-fit waist\u2122 system makes them both comfortable and easily adjustable. The seat is insulated with Primaloft to ensure that the butt is kept warm even if you tear a hole.",
