  "description": "The Devold\u00ae Arktis sweater is inspired by the iconic Nansen sweater. While the Nansen is a thick and chunky sweater, the Arktis is a softer, thinner and more versatile version of the original. Made from 100% pure new wool, it is naturally temperature-regulating and breathable, and transports moisture away from your body. Like its origin, the Arktis is knitted in a m\u00e9lange colourway, adding a robust and trendy look to the sweater.",
