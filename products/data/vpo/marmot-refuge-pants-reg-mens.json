  "description": "Built with two-layer, seam-taped waterproof fabric and lightweight insulation, these Refuge ski pants will keep you warm and dry out in the snowy winter wonderland. Internal snow gaiters help keep the snow out whether you're crisscrossing the resort or dropping into a deep powder run through the trees. Skip lunch and maximize the number of runs you can get in before the lifts close\u2014zippered pockets all over the Refuge pants give you more than enough places to stash gear and snacks to keep break times to a minimum.",
