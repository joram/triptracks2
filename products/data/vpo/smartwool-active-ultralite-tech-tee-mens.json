Its regular fit gives you room to move, while its flatlock seam construction and offset shoulder seams help reduce chafing. But best of all, it\u2019s made with a combination of Merino wool and recycled polyester, to help manage moisture, regulate temperature, and increase dry time when you start to sweat. Great for a hike in the hills or a jog in the neighborhood, this tee will help you start and stay comfy.",
