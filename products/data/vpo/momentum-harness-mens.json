  "description": "For all-around climbers who know that time spent fiddling with leg loops and adjusting a pinching waistbelt is time wasted, the Black Diamond Momentum delivers a time-saving design for all styles of climbing. A pre-threaded Speed Adjust waistbelt buckle saves time and eliminates error when tying in, while Dual Core Construction\u2122 puts an emphasis on comfort, even when you're posted up at a hanging belay. TrakFIT leg-loops easily adjust to accommodate different layering configurations and four pressure-molded gear loops and a haul loop make this their most popular all-rounder.",
