  "description": "The Pocketboy is a favorite of arborists because of its space-saving design and smooth cutting action. This larger 170 mm version of the PocketBoy Curve gives you a longer reach and faster cutting than straight blade versions - especially when cutting branches above shoulder height. The blade is made with impulse hardened teeth that stay sharp three times longer than regular blades and have Silky's Mirai-Me Technology with 4 cutting angles on each tooth for the smoothest cutting action possible.",
