The ultralight, uncushioned design features a blend of merino wool, nylon, and LYCRA\u00ae with key support zones in the ankle, Achilles, and instep. The seamless toe reduces bulk and prevents blisters. <br><br>Inspired by nature, icebreaker harnesses the performance qualities of natural fibers to offer an alternative to clothing based on petrochemical synthetics.
