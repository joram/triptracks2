  "description": "These midweight mountain pants are destined for fall adventures. Whether you're going all the way up or going the distance, these stretchy, breathable bottoms are trail- and crag-ready for long days and relaxing campsite nights. Getting a little wet comes with the territory in the wild, so we added a water-repellent finish to protect against the inevitable. These pants are designed for making moves on and off the rocks, from a gusseted crotch and hem to abrasion-resistant fabric for added durable comfort.",
