  "description": "An incredibly lightweight and breathable tech tee for high-exertion days, the ZoneKnit\u2122 Short Sleeve Tee features engineered body-mapping technology to provide optimal ventilation and temperature control. The ZoneKnit features a combination of icebreaker\u2019s moisture managing jersey Cool-Lite\u2122 fabric with panels of Cool-Lite\u2122 eyelet mesh on the back and sleeves that help dispense excess heat. Offset shoulder seams reduce friction when carrying a pack.\n\nSoft merino and TENCEL\u2122 Lyocell, sourced from responsible eucalyptus plantations, combine to create icebreaker Cool-Lite\u2122, a fabric that helps to regulate your body\u2019s microclimate. Inspired by nature, icebreaker harnesses the performance qualities of natural fibres to offer an alternative to clothing based on petrochemical synthetics.",
