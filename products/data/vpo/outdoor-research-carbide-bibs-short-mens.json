  "description": "The Carbide Bibs are built to perform on both sides of the resort boundary. It is designed to adapt to whatever conditions and terrain are on the menu, whether layering up for a cold and deep day inbounds or staying fast and light on backcountry tours. They utilize 3-layer Pertex\u00ae waterproof protection, and their feature-forward and intuitive design details are geared for utility and versatility. Dual side zips make it easy to dump excess heat when sweating in the skin track, and an avalanche beacon-specific pocket keeps your most important safety gear within quick and easy access. These bibs are perfected with durable, stretchy suspender webbing that's as comfortable as it is functional. For those who prefer a single kit that punches above its weight for resort and backcountry functionality, the Carbide Bibs are an elite option.",
