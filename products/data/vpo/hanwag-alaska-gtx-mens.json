  "description": "Comfortable, robust and enormously versatile \u2013 an absolute trekking classic. The Alaska GTX copes with everything from day trips to demanding hikes and week-long outdoor trekking adventures. Thanks to its GORE-TEX lining, it keeps your feet dry even in mud and rain. This significantly reduces the risk of blisters. <br><br>The high upper has a one-piece construction that stabilises and protects the ankle area. Built to last: Even after many years of service the Alaska can easily be resoled ready for further use. The comfortable fit makes it the right choice for longer treks. <br><br>*** All Hanwag boots are sold under UK sizing - Please see size chart for details/conversion",
