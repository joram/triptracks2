  "description": "The Guides Down Hoody is a classic winter puffer that can hang from the backyard to the backcountry. This super packable down jacket is a must-have in your cold weather layering kit with technical features and cozy comfort that makes it a perfect fit on and off the mountain. This puffer lives for freezing bluebird days with enough puff to keep you warm on the chairlift ride up or the commute downtown, and breathable enough for steep skins, deep powder romps, or chasing the kids and the dog at the park. No party fouls for spilled beers here, Down Defender ensures you can go full speed ahead when the fun gets a little wet on the hill or after hours.",
