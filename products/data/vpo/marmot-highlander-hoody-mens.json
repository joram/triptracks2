  "description": "Forecast calling for cold? Time to get after it in the Highlander Hoody. We added a hood to our classic down puffer for extra warmth and versatility in this coffee-shop cool insulated jacket. Pull that hood over your helmet while you're belaying a bud or slinging them back on the ice and stay warm and protected from freezing gusts while waiting on the midtown train or the gondola to and from the slopes. 700-fill-power down packs tons of heat on and off the mountain and packs down small for easy-stuffing storage when you're on the move.",
