This eco-friendly winter ski jacket is built for total weather protection with added insulation and extra-breathable shell so you can get after it in below-freezing temps going up or down the mountain. Whether you're on your butt in the snow learning how to board or slicing up untouched powder in the backcountry, the built-in powder skirt will keep the snow out and the good times rollin' in. No need to pull off the jacket for your pre-skiing pit-stop at the coffee shop, you've got pockets for days to keep your card, valuables, and ski pass handy.",
