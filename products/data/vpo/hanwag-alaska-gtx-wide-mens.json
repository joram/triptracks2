  "description": "Comfortable, robust and enormously versatile \u2013 an absolute trekking classic. The Alaska GTX copes with everything from day trips to demanding hikes and week-long outdoor trekking adventures. Thanks to its GORE-TEX lining, it keeps your feet dry even in mud and rain. This significantly reduces the risk of blisters. The high upper has a one-piece construction that stabilises and protects the ankle area. <br><br>Built to last: Even after many years of service the Alaska can easily be resoled ready for further use. Made over a Wide Last, which provides extra room at the front and ball of the foot, the Wide version prevents pressure points for wider feet at the forefoot.<br><br>*** All Hanwag boots are sold under UK sizing - Please see size chart for details/conversion",
