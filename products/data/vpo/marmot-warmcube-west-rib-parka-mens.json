  "description": "When the temperature drops to arctic levels and the icy cold wind is gusting, reach for the West Rib Parka. 800-fill-power goose down and Pertex Quantum\u00ae fabric combine to provide superior wind protection and warmth for summit bid-worthy adventures. Protected by a water-resistant layer of overlapping baffles, our innovative 3DWarmCube\u2122 construction prevents down fill from being displaced and traps heat in the surrounding channels so you stay warm\u2014no matter what. Keep small gear organized and accessible in the interior mesh, zippered hand, and chest pockets. The attached hood offers maximum coverage with an adjustable drawcord at the back that won't interfere with a helmet. When it's time to head off mountain, stash this packable jacket into the included stuff sack for space-saving storage.",
