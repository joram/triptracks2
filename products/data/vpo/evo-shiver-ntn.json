  "description": "Shiver NTN carries on the whole experience developed on Evo's construction and it is exclusively dedicated to those who are searching for advanced technology, lightness, practicality, high performance in a cutting edge boot. Micrometrical buckles for a sensible and outstanding fitting sensation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Compatible with NTN and Low Tech binding.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;***Note: with all Crispi NTN boots\u2013 the distance between the tech toe pins and the back of the NTN \u201cheel\u201d is slightly shorter than on Scarpa boots, and this means the smaller boot sizes are prone to pre-releasing from the small sized Meidjo binding. For this reason, we do not recommend using Crispi boots with the small size Meidjo binding (mondo size 26 or smaller). The large binding does not have the same problem.",
