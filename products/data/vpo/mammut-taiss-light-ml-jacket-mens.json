  "description": "The Taiss Light can be worn any time of year and is perfect for all kinds of mountain activities. Medium-strength 4-way stretch fleece with high nylon content and shaped cut provide freedom of movement and abrasion resistance. The smooth outer material makes the jacket ideal for wearing under a hardshell layer. The material is breathable and dries quickly, while flat seams improve wearing comfort. Features such as pockets placed higher up to accommodate your climbing harness and thumb loops make the Taiss Light a highly functional, versatile mid-layer.",
