  "description": "Circa 1993, the Smith Monroe Peak sunglasses could be found ripping down moguls and cruising up mountains. This time around, they're all about the '90s nostalgia. From commute to campsite, beach day to road trip, they boost your view with color-enhancing ChromaPop\u2122 lens technology. Distinctive side shields feature ChromaPop\u2122 windows so your view is always in panorama mode.",
