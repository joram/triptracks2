  "description": "The Vidda Pro Jacket made from hardwearing and sustainable G-1000 Eco featuring no less than seven pockets for plenty of storage was so warmly received that Fj\u00e4llr\u00e4ven decided to release it in a winter version as well. Vidda Pro Wool Padded Jacket shares the robust, weather-resistant features of its sibling, but has received a cosy layer of sustainable, traceable Swedish recovered wool padding for extra warmth. On windy days, the Re-wool lining inside the hood will be much appreciated. Perfect for trekking, bushcraft and a variety of outings during the colder months of the year.",
