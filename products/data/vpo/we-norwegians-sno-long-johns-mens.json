  "description": "These long johns features 98% merino wool and 2% Creora Eco Soft Elastic for maximum breathability, odor resistance and flexibility for those active days.<br><br>We have finally launched our Scandinavian Luxury base-layers. We have used our favorite yarn from S\u00fcdwolle, the Nm 1/60, 98% super fine merino wool, 17,5 microns, and added 2% Creora-Eco-Soft, to make the fabric stretchy. The single jersey also makes the fabric light and breathable, it almost feels like a second layer of skin. These long johns have a fitted shape with flatlock seams for more comfort. <br><br>We can also recommend using these underneath suit pants on cold days, as it is very light and breathable. All of our SN\u00d8 pieces comes in a box that we have tried to keep as simple and minimalistic as possible, so that you can use it as a small storage box.",
