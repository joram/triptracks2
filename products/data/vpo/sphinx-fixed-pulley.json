  "description": "A super-compact, ultralight pulley with fixed side plates. The Sphinx is very easy to handle and convenient to carry on a harness while ski touring or mountaineering. The attachment hole is large enough to allow full rotation of a standard locking carabiner. Self-lubricated brass bushings are perfect for light applications at low speed. Unlike other pulleys with fixed side plates, the Sphinx allows for a prusik knot to be installed on one side (aramid cord suggested) making it an ideal pulley for rigging a haul system on route or managing crevasse rescues.",
