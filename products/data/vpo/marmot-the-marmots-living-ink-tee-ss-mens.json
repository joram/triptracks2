  "description": "Whether you're rolling through town on your single speed or watching the sun rise from your tent, this t-shirt is a winner. First place in everyday, sun-is-shining rockability, and a very close second in campsite comfort only to maybe your plush down sleeping bag\u2014and that's saying something. With a soft coziness worthy of getting you through thick and thin, you can count on this classic recycled polyester and cotton blend tee from dawn patrol to late night bonfires. Plus, you'll be just as stoked about how many days of the year you can wear this t-shirt as you are about its ink grown from real life algae. Far out, mannnnn....",
