  "description": "These highly stretchable ski pants are made in a windproof recycled nylon/recycled polyester/elastane mix which ensures great flexibility and comfort. They are reinforced with a recycled polyamide/polyester/elastane elastane mix on exposed areas to provide extra durability where needed. To prevent wet snow from soaking up, the bottom hem is reinforced with 200D recycled GORE-TEX. Together, these three materials create the perfect balance between weight, comfort, durability and sustainability. <br><br>This is a softshell pant designed for high-intensity or spring season free ski mountaineering. It has a clean design where comfort and mobility is key, combined with achieving the right balance of air permeability and protection. It provides all essential features, and has customized features such as elastic snow gaiter with webbing and backer, so can be customized to different boots. It's also waterproof on the knees due to an extra liner, so you can comfortably sit on your knees without risking any soaking. The pants have a regular fit with articulated knees to ensure great mobility.",
