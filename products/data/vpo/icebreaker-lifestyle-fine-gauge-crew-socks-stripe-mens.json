  "description": "The Lifestyle Fine Gauge Crew Stripe socks are ultralight socks for everyday comfort and style. Made with a luxurious fine-gauge merino yarn, they are breathable, stretchy and soft next to your skin. The uncushioned design features instep support to keep the sock in place. Reinforcements in the heel and toe increase durability, while the seamless toe reduces bulk and prevents blisters. <br><br>Inspired by nature, Icebreaker harnesses the performance qualities of natural fibres to offer an alternative to clothing based on petrochemical synthetics. Merino is an annually renewable fibre that naturally resists odours, keeps you cool when it\u2019s hot and warm when it\u2019s not, and lets your skin breathe for comfort all day, every day.",
