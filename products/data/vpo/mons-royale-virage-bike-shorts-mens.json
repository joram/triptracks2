  "description": "The ultimate lightweight yet durable trail rippers are designed for on and off the bike. The zipped phone pocket and a matching belt keep everything secure whilst the versatile fit lets you wear them anywhere. This high-performance fabric uses recycled polyester made from PET bottles. Polyester sheds weight and adds durability, elastane increases mobility and merino ensures it retains the anti-odour, temperature regulating properties of merino wool.",
