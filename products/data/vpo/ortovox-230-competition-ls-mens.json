  "description": "The 230 Competition LS for men helps you deliver top sporting performance with a whole new look \u2013 whether you\u2019re on a ski tour, freeriding, or on a high alpine tour.<br><br>The 230 Merino Competition line is produced using a seamless circular knitting technique so that when the weather gets cold and the going gets tough, every area of the body is covered by the right thickness of merino wool. The basic ribbed structure consists of 190 g/m\u00b2 merino, giving the functional shirt elasticity for maximum freedom of movement. A particularly breathable mesh structure is used in heat spots, while 240 g/m\u00b2 wool warms areas that are sensitive to the cold, such as the kidneys. This body-mapping principle allows for a close fit while providing maximum ventilation. At just 16.5 microns in diameter, the delicate merino fibers feel pleasantly soft against the skin and at the same time make the functional shirt quick-drying and very durable.<br><br>The new color gradient from light to dark is created by knitting in mottled yarn and gives the functional shirt a special pattern thanks to the body-mapping structure. This puts the 230 Competition LS for men out in front when it comes to looks, too!",
