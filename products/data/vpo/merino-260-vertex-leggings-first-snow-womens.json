  "description": "Super-warm merino base layer bottoms with a unique jacquard pattern fabric, the 260 Vertex Leggings First Snow is a go-to layering piece for skiing, snowshoeing and other cold-weather pursuits. The super soft and breathable 260gm jacquard fabric is made from 100% merino wool, and the gusseted underarms increase range of motion. Flatlock stitching and offset seams throughout makes for a soft next-to-skin feel. The unique all-over pattern draws inspiration from the angular, crystalline shapes of snowflakes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Inspired by nature, icebreaker harnesses the performance qualities of natural fibres to offer an alternative to clothing based on petrochemical synthetics. Merino is an annually renewable fibre that naturally resists odours, keeps you cool when it\u2019s hot and warm when it\u2019s not, and lets your skin breathe for comfort all day, every day.",
