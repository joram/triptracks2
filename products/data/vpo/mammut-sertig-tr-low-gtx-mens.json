  "description": "Comfort and speed collide in the trail running expansion of our much-loved Sertig collection. Lightweight and flexible, its Mammut Swiss Design sole provides great responsiveness and grip, while its GORE-TEX membrane keeps feet dry when the weather isn\u2019t. Rounded off with a breathable mesh forefoot, high-rebound midsole, and foam-lined ankle for exceptional cushioning and comfort, it\u2019s the ideal partner to level up your mid-distance runs.",
