  "description": "Highly breathable with targeted ventilation areas and a movement-focused fit, the ZoneKnit\u2122 Insulated Long Sleeve Zip Hoodie is a body-mapped hoodie primed for adventure. Ideal for skiing, hiking and other active adventures, the ZoneKnit features panels of heavyweight quilted MerinoFill\u2122 yarn insulation in the chest and hood to provide warmth directly where it\u2019s needed. Raglan sleeves improve mobility, and no side seams reduces chafing when you're on the move.<br><br>Inspired by nature, icebreaker harnesses the performance qualities of natural fibers to offer an alternative to clothing based on petrochemical synthetics. Merino is an annually renewable fiber that naturally resists odors, keeps you cool when it\u2019s hot and warm when it\u2019s not, and lets your skin breathe for comfort all day, every day.",
