  "description": "For the skier or rider who demands comfort and mobility for backcountry missions, but desires ample protection for powder days on the hill, the Recon Ski Pant delivers. Featuring 4-way stretch fabric, this pant moves with you on big tours in the mountains, while the Recon\u2019s BD.dry\u2122 waterproof/breathable solution keeps you dry on deep turns and storm days. The Recon features an updated, low-profile electronics pocket over the right thigh. An integrated RECCO reflector adds to the pants\u2019 snow safety capabilities, while the instep patches guard against ski edges and crampon points. The Recon\u2019s offset side vents allow you to dump heat on the skin track, and the high mounted snow gaiter keeps out the snow.",
