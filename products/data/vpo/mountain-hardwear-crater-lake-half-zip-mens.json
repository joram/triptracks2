  "description": "Whether you're on the skin track or the single track, those first rays of warming spring sunshine after a long winter are something special. While you're soaking up that Vitamin D, the Crater Lake\u2122 1/4 Zip has you protected from unwanted UV rays thanks to its UPF 50+ fabric. This lightweight and comfortable top also pulls double duty as a breathable baselayer when the clouds roll in and it's time to layer up.",
