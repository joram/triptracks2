  "description": "All the technical benefits from our full length 200gm bottoms in a 3/4 cut. This super soft performance layer concludes at the mid calf-length making it a perfect accompaniment to ski boots and other high cuff footwear that you can\u2019t have wrinkled or bunched up fabric beneath. This shorter cut is also perfect to wear it under shorts or even as a stand alone layer for when on the run or for activity in cooler temperatures.<br><br>Combine these benefits with flat seams to prevent chafing, sculpted panels for a performance fit and a wide waistband for comfort, and you have a perfect performance layer for every season.",
