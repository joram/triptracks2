  "description": "The Speed Winter Tights are breathable, stretchy bottoms that are ideal for cold-weather training on or off the trail. These extra-warm, form-fitting tights feature a dynamic blend of all-natural merino wool and a touch of elastane, as well as a gusseted construction for ample freedom of movement. The upper legs feature double-layer fabric for added warmth, and a phone pocket on the right thigh keeps your device accessible. <br><br>Inspired by nature, icebreaker harnesses the performance qualities of natural fibres to offer an alternative to clothing based on petrochemical synthetics. Merino is an annually renewable fibre that naturally resists odours, keeps you cool when it\u2019s hot and warm when it\u2019s not, and lets your skin breathe for comfort all day, every day.",
