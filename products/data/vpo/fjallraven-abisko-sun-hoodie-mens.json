  "description": "Light and comfortable sweater for outdoor life and travelling in warm climates. Made using a technical jersey knit that wicks away moisture and dries in no time for maximum comfort on sunny days on the hiking trail. Long sleeves and a hood offer light protection from the sun, and thumbholes stop the sleeves from riding up. Well-fitting but with a little extra room to let air circulate around the body. Gussets under the arms for extra freedom of movement.",
