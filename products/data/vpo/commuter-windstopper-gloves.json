  "description": "The lightweight and packable Commuter Windstopper Gloves were made for those who appreciate the small details that make a big difference. The 4-way stretch outer material is woven for breathability and features GORE-TEX\u00ae Windstopper technology to keep your hands warm and protected from the elements. The palm is reinforced with silicone print overlays for a better grip on your morning commute, while the microfleece interior adds an extra layer of warmth. The close-to-hand fit lets you use your touchscreen devices easily, and the reflective logos add visibility in low-light conditions. Designed for commuting in cold weather, the Commuter Windstopper Gloves keep hands warm while biking to class or waiting for the next train downtown.",
