  "description": "Cool and comfortable with a style that goes from the couch to the climbing gym without skipping a beat. Sure, it sounds too good to be true. But it\u2019s actually their Vaha Short for men. And if you don\u2019t believe them, just check out the dozens upon dozens of 5-star customer testimonials.<br><br>It all starts with the fabric, made from a lightweight, breathable, and sustainable blend of hemp and recycled polyester (with a bit of spandex for extra stretch). These materials give the Vaha Short the natural strength of UPF 50+ plus odor-reducing and quick-drying properties.<br><br>But they didn\u2019t stop there. They also added a super soft knit elastic waistband, so you can avoid the scratchiness elastic sometimes causes. The relaxed fit keeps things perfectly casual. But on top of that, they added plenty of pockets for extra convenience",
