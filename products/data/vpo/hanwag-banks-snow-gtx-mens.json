  "description": "The Banks Snow GTX is a high-quality winter hiking boot, equipped with comprehensive technical features for ambitious winter outdoor enthusiasts. In addition to its reliably insulating and waterproof GORE-TEX Partelana lining, it has a discrete, dedicated snowshoe connection point. This makes it quick and easy to secure the snowshoe strap at the heel. <br><br>And the intelligent lacing design prevents pressure points from forming under snowshoe straps. The small, additional mini gaiter made of stretch material at the cuff prevents snow from getting down into the boot when in rougher ground. As such, the Banks Snow GTX feels at home both on hiking paths or in off-trail winter terrain.<br><br>*** All Hanwag boots are sold under UK sizing - Please see size chart for details/conversion",
