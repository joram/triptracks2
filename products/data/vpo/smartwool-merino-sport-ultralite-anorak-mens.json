  "description": "The Men\u2019s Merino Sport Ultralite Anorak is filled with practical details: a half zipper for venting, double-welt hand pockets, a moveable fit, and adjustable cording at the waist and neck. Plus, they\u2019ve added body-mapped panels of Merino Sport 120 fabric for breathability and temperature control. Capping it all off is the lightweight nylon outer shell, which helps with wind and weather resistance. Next time you\u2019re about to head out when the weather\u2019s questionable, be sure to bring this anorak along.",
