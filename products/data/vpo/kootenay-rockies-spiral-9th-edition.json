  "description": "Tucked in the southeast corner of BC, the Kootenay Rockies are one of Canada's best-kept outdoor adventure secrets. As you move west from the world-famous peaks of the Rocky Mountains, the crowds thin out and the opportunities for outdoor adventure grow. From hiking beneath towering mountain peaks and through valleys of wildflowers in Glacier National Park, Kootenay National Park, Mount Revelstoke National Park, or Yoho National Park to paddling rushing whitewater rivers or turquoise glacial lakes, there is no shortage of outdoor adventure opportunities in this beautiful region. A maze of logging roads extends deep into the backcountry, offering access to countless campsites and hiking and mountain biking trails. In the winter, the region is covered by a thick layer of dry, fluffy snow, affectionately referred to by the locals as champagne powder.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To help you take advantage of this incredible region, the latest edition of our Kootenay Rockies Backroad Mapbook features cartography updates including new symbols for readability, updated and expanded roads and trail systems, updated fish stocking and trail charts, added overland routes, new bonus Adventure sections, and much more. The printed version of the mapbook comes in the convenient 21.5 x 28 cm (8.5 x 11 inch) mapbook format with a heavy-duty spiral-bound cover. The 224-page book includes 51 maps at a 1:200,000 scale, along with 11 main Outdoor Adventure sections, new Bonus Adventure sections, a Service Provider Directory, Map and Adventure Index, Trip Planning tools and more.
