  "description": "Over 25 years ago, Smartwool invented the original Merino wool performance sock\u2014the Classic Hike. The Classic Hike remains mostly unchanged and certainly unmatched in comfort. But today, it\u2019s getting upgraded. And that upgrade starts with recycled nylon\u2014creating a more sustainable (but just as comfortable) sock. They\u2019re also made with responsibly sourced, ZQ-certified wool that was grown with a focus on ensuring environmental, social, and economic sustainability while also taking the best care of their Merino sheep. This is a cozy, capable classic that is never going out of style.",
