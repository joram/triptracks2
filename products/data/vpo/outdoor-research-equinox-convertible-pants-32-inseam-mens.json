  "description": "\u201cThe best hiking pants ever.\u201d We\u2019d like to leave this description at that, but since you probably want more details, we\u2019ll dig in a bit. The Equinox Convertible Hiking Pants have everything you need in a piece of outdoor clothing. They\u2019re breathable, they\u2019re lightweight, they\u2019re wind and water resistant. They also feature the perfect amount of stretch. But the goodness doesn\u2019t stop there. For those sunny days out on the trail, these men\u2019s hiking pants will keep your skin happy with UPF 50+ sun protection. And if the heat\u2019s hitting hard, no sweat; you can switch to shorts using these pant\u2019s ankle zips and Sly Thigh Zip Off\u2122 design, which zips off at an angle to uncover a shorts-length cut hidden beneath the pant leg. <br><br>This trademarked design ensures that, unlike most zip-off hiking pants, these pants convert to shorts that are the right length, don\u2019t have a zipper edge that\u2019ll chafe your thighs, and do actually look good. <br><br>Bonus: these pants work great as cold-weather hiking pants too. Just put them atop the right base layers and you\u2019ll be good to go. Next time you\u2019re heading out for a big summit, some splitboarding, or a simple day hike, throw on these technical pants, toss your keys into their zippered left pocket, and take on that adventure like your middle name is Made for This.",
