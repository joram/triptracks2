  "description": "Midweight merino base layer bottoms designed to help regulate temperature during high-intensity activity, the 200 ZoneKnit\u2122 Legless are the ideal choice for cold-weather training and adventures when you\u2019re moving fast. Made with 100% Merino wool for all-natural breathability and odour-resistance, the ZoneKnit also features strategically placed panels of eyelet merino mesh to help actively regulate body temperature. The mid-calf cut eliminates bunching when wearing ski boots or other high-cuff footwear. A gusseted construction provides enhanced mobility, and flatlock stitching reduces chafing. <br><br>Inspired by nature, icebreaker harnesses the performance qualities of natural fibres to offer an alternative to clothing based on petrochemical synthetics. Merino is an annually renewable fibre that naturally resists odours, keeps you cool when it\u2019s hot and warm when it\u2019s not, and lets your skin breathe for comfort all day, every day.",
