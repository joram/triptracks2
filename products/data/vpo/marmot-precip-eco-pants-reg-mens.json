  "description": "Meet the environmentally conscious and high-performing next generation of waterproofing: the lightweight PreCip Eco Pant. The waterproof/breathable, PFC-free Marmot NanoPro\u2122 recycled nylon face fabric lasts longer, thanks to the advanced technology of our microporous coating. Sturdier and more durable and with a patented dry-touch finish, these water-repelling pants will keep you comfortable and protected during planned treks in stormy weather and as a just-in-case layer in your pack for unexpected downpours. These water-repelling pants also feature fully taped seams to prevent leaks, ankle snaps with tabs to make it easy to pull boots on and off, and bonded storm flaps over the zippers to keep moisture out. Zippered hand pockets and a zippered back pocket provide quick storage while the elastic waist gives you a secure fit.ip.",
