  "description": "Smartwool's Hike Full Cushion Crew socks, formerly PhD\u00ae Outdoor, use cushioning on the entire sock to help maximize warmth and protection. These responsibly sourced, ZQ-certified Merino wool hike socks are built with their top sock tech, including Indestructawool\u2122 technology for enhanced durability, their 4 Degree\u2122 Elite Fit System for a dialed-in, performance-oriented fit, and their Virtually Seamless\u2122 toe for maximum in-shoe/boot comfort. We've updated their hike line by improving mesh zones for additional breathability, as well as creating a new ply structure that reduces pilling while enhancing hand-feel and comfort. Not to mention, their best-feeling, best-fitting hiking socks are now made with recycled nylon\u2014making these socks more sustainable than ever. Now that's something you can feel good in and about.",
