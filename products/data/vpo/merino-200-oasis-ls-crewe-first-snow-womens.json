  "description": "The benchmark against which all others are judged, the 200 Oasis Long Sleeve Crewe First Snow is an ultra-comfortable base layer top that make the perfect foundation for cold-weather layering. Featuring icebreaker's best-selling 100% merino wool jersey fabric that\u2019s breathable, insulating, and odour-resistant, this top also features flatlock seams throughout for a smooth next-to-skin feel. The unique winter pattern draws inspiration from the angular, crystalline shapes of snowflakes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Inspired by nature, icebreaker harnesses the performance qualities of natural fibres to offer an alternative to clothing based on petrochemical synthetics. Merino is an annually renewable fibre that naturally resists odours, keeps you cool when it\u2019s hot and warm when it\u2019s not, and lets your skin breathe for comfort all day, every day.",
