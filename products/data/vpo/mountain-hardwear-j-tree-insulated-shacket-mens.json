  "description": "The warm feeling of a J Tree morning, comfortably quilted inside one of their most withstanding materials. When camp gets crisp with fall air, and you need something simple yet substantial to get the fire started, this shacket is the holistic hybrid that does it all, without doing too much. With just enough insulation to level out the chill, just enough stretch and room to move freely, and just enough form for both upscale and unconventional, pack it for the unpredictable and always be prepared and polished.",
