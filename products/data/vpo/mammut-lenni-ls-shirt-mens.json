  "description": "The Lenni Longsleeve Shirt is a lightweight garment designed for hiking. The fabric is comfortable on the skin, making it a great piece of leisurewear as well. To prevent unpleasant odors, the shirt is made with HeiQ Fresh FFL antimicrobial technology. This makes the Lenni a shirt that never lets you down, even on long trekking trips and grueling day hikes. The material is two-thirds recycled polyester for fast drying and easy care. The buttoning chest pocket is the perfect place for keeping your passport. A pleat on the back improves comfort when you move around. The updated version of the Mammut classic with plaid pattern is a practical choice for a whole range of outdoor activities.",
