  "description": "Send your kids to ski school knowing they'll stay warm and ultra dry no matter how crazy the conditions or the lift lines get. Super-warm down insulation will provide maximum warmth and a soft buffer for powder face plants and butt bumping on the bunny slope. Safety is always first when kids are learning to ski, so the helmet-compatible hood is a must-have for inevitable tumbles and overconfident trail selections. Waterproof shell and fixed powder skirt will also keep hot chocolate spills and snow angels from turning into wet disasters.",
