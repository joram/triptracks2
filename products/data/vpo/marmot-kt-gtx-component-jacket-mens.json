  "description": "You\u2019ll be ready for whatever the mountain throws your way when you suit up in the Men\u2019s GORE-TEX\u00ae KT Component Jacket. It comes with a waterproof, breathable shell and a liner jacket packed with 80 grams of ThermalR synthetic insulation. Wear them together over your baselayer when riding the resort on cold days, and if it warms up while riding you can shed the mid-layer and stay cool. When the temps drop at night, rock the ThermalR insulator jacket solo to your dinner reservation in the resort village.",
