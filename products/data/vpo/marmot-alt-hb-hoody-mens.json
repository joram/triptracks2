Made with recycled fabric and a unique Octa-yarn\u2122 lining that moves heat away from the body, this hoody keeps your core at just the right temp when you're getting after it. A gusseted underarm and articulated elbow gives you room to pull off some epic moves, and features like the elastic attached hood and adjustable drawcord hem allow for optimal warmth and coverage.",
