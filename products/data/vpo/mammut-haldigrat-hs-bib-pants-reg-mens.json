  "description": "Whether you\u2019re in resort or exploring the backcountry, when you\u2019re on the hunt for the perfect line, this hardshell bib\u2019s got your back. The Haldigrat HS line is light enough for the ascent and burly enough for the descent thanks to a supple, sustainable outer fabric made of durable post-consumer recycled nylon, and a Drytech Pro Technology waterproof membrane. The freeride-inspired cut offers a laid-back style loaded with features. The bib keeps snow out and has a dedicated avalanche transceiver pocket, while side zippers offer great ventilation.",
