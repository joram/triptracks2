  "description": "The Tamok Down750 Jacket is probably going to be your best puffy powder pal for the freeride season. This warm and rugged down jacket is made to withstand backcountry rides through a tricky forest and still is light enough to be accompanied by an outer layer. Inspired by the original western riders, it combines our Loaded Minimalism design philosophy with great functionality. The durable, recycled 45D outer fabric has a natural and cotton-like feel, and the shoulders have reinforced yokes with a suede look for that extra protection and edge. The 750Down fill is RDS 2.0 certified, and the jacket packs down easily into your daypack as an essential part of your everyday on- or off-mountain rider kit. It\u2019s completely wind-resistant and will have no problem winning a quick draw with some light snowfall.",
