  "description": "Ideal for variable temperatures, the versatile Renegade\u2122 Cargo Convertible delivers the best of both worlds. Soft yet extremely durable, our exclusive softshell fabric is quick dry with abrasion and water-resistance. Superior stretch and Kuhl's articulated patterning provide superior freedom of motion and the ideal fit. As temperatures change, Kuhl's Stealth\u2122 zip-off design allows you to discretely transition from pants to shorts or visa-versa.",
