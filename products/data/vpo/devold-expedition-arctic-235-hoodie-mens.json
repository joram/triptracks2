  "description": "Developed in collaboration with polar explorer B\u00f8rge Ousland, who has sworn to Devold's Expedition series on his expeditions. As a result of his feedback and wishes, Expedition has been further developed with a kangaroo pocket in front. A place to warm your hands in extreme weather conditions, with room for both hands at the same time and as a pocket to store batteries. The pocket is placed above the waist to avoid colliding with carrying systems from the backpack / sledge at the hip. <br><br>The hood is carefully adapted to the shape of the head, to prevent cold loss from the neck and bare areas of the head region, as well as to fit under a thicker beanie. The high neck can be pulled over the nose, with breathing holes to increase the transport of moisture away from the face in very low temperatures.",
