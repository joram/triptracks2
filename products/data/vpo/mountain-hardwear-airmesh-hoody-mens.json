  "description": "A single layer can have a bigger impact than you think. This hoody may look unassuming, but once you have it on, you won't need anything else. Made with a unique active mesh, consisting of hollow, tube-like fibers with radial extensions that absorb sweat, quick-drying capabilities are at its highest, supporting insulation and heat-shielding properties to keep you cozy in the coldest conditions or even just at home, all while reducing weight by half compared to yarns of comparable thickness. The sheer possibilities are endless.",
