  "description": "The high-quality hybrid soft shell Courmayeur Pants have been developed for ambitious mountain sports enthusiasts. The highly breathable, elasticated and wind-repellent Schoeller\u00ae soft shell material makes them suitable for a wide range of applications, while providing comfort and the required freedom of movement. The more robust double-weave material on the seat, knees and lower legs is particularly abrasion-proof and more than a match for contact with rocks. The waistband can be adjusted from the outside to ensure a perfect fit. An essential feature for mountaineering and climbing: pockets allowing easy access even when wearing a climbing harness. A PFC-free DWR treatment gives the Courmayeur SO Pants durable dirt- and water-repellent properties.",
