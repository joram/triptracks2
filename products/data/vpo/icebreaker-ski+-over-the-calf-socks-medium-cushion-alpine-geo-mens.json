  "description": "The Ski+ Medium Over the Calf Alpine Geo socks are durable, stretchy and highly breathable socks for technical performance on the snow. The fully cushioned design features a blend of merino wool, nylon and LYCRA\u00ae that\u2019s anatomically sculpted with key support zones in the ankle, Achilles, and instep. The breathe zone increases ventilation, and the seamless toe reduces bulk and prevents blisters. <br><br>Inspired by nature, icebreaker harnesses the performance qualities of natural fibers to offer an alternative to clothing based on petrochemical synthetics. Merino is an annually renewable fiber that naturally resists odors, keeps you cool when it\u2019s hot and warm when it\u2019s not, and lets your skin breathe for comfort all day, every day.",
