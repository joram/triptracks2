  "description": "This mid-cut leather boot with an authentic double-stitched construction is a kind of homage to traditional mountain boots. In a modern take on the design, it\u2019s a high-quality, elegant leather boot designed for everyday use. The Valepp is made using distinctive Terracare full-grain leather from the Heinen tannery, the same as was traditionally used to make mountain boots. <br><br>The double-stitched upper features an additional robust cotton insert and is fitted with a lightweight, cushioning Vibram V-Lite sole. Both the footbed and lining are made of chrome-free tanned leather. Even after many years of service the Valepp\u2019s double-stitched construction means it can easily be resoled ready for further use. <br><br>*** All Hanwag boots are sold under UK sizing - Please see size chart for details/conversion",
