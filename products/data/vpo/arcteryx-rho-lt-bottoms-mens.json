  "description": "The Rho LT is your lightweight thermal base layer for low and medium output when it\u2019s cold out. The odour-resistant Torrent\u2122 fabric has a soft, brushed surface that speeds moisture transfer and delivers serious comfort next to the skin. Elastane fibres add stretch and work with the articulated patterning and gusseted crotch for freedom of movement. The waistband is designed for comfort and easy layering, and a smart thigh pocket stashes a smartphone.",
