  "description": "Providing natural weather resistance during daily travels and mountain adventures, the Shell+\u2122 Cotton Windbreaker features a lightweight 100% cotton construction with a PFC-free DWR finish to shed the wind and light rain. The elasticized hood and high neck provide added protection while merino eyelet mesh panels under the arms and on the back provide increased ventilation when you're on the move. Raglan sleeves and a gusseted construction provide ample range of motion, and a zippered chest pocket keeps your small essentials secure. <br><br>Inspired by nature, Icebreaker harnesses the performance qualities of natural fibres to offer an alternative to clothing based on petrochemical synthetics. Merino is an annually renewable fibre that naturally resists odours, keeps you cool when it\u2019s hot and warm when it\u2019s not, and lets your skin breathe for comfort all day, every day.",
