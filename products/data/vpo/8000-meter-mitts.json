  "description": "On the 8000 Meter's bucket list: Denali, Aconcagua, and Karakorum. This high-altitude master features GORE-TEX\u00ae fabric that's waterproof and windproof yet breathable and packable, a removable PrimaLoft\u00ae 700-fill-power-down mitt for extreme warmth, and moisture-wicking, 3-dimensional DriClime\u00ae lining that keeps your hands safe from the elements. The durable carabiner loop helps with accessibility and won't interfere with your harness, ropework, or ascenders. Leather-reinforced palms increase durability and last longer, so you can take them from one epic adventure to another.",
