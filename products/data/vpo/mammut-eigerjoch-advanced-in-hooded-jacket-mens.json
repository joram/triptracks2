  "description": "The Eigerjoch Advanced always keeps you warm without weighing you down. The insulated jacket works well as a mid or outer layer. It\u2019s filled with a blend of two types of insulation to offer the perfect balance of warmth and moisture wicking: premium water-repellant goose down from Responsible Down Standard suppliers keeps your upper arms, core and hood interior nice and warm. The exposed and high-perspiration spots, such as the shoulders, hood, back and underarm sections are made with soft, stretchy PrimaLoft\u00ae Gold Insulation Active\u2122 synthetic fiber material. The synthetic insulation also keeps you warm when the weather takes a turn for the worst or during more aerobic stages. <br><br>The Eigerjoch Advanced jacket emerges unscathed after scuffles with rock and also holds up well to heavy backpacks thanks to its extra abrasion-resistant Pertex\u00ae Quantum outer material. Innovative and uncompromising. A light, technical down jacket for a wide range of mountaineering adventures.",
