  "description": "<p>The development of the Felsgrat Hybrid Windbreaker represents the fulfillment of a wish for our Mammut Pro Team Athletes. Weighing just 180&nbsp;grams for size M, it is an ultra-light and breathable anorak that is robust enough to withstand almost all conditions. The Pertex\u00ae Equilibrium material on the forearms and body is lightweight, vapor-permeable and water-repellent. The helmet-compatible hood and shoulder sections made from 3-layer Mammut DRYtechnologyTM Performance material are particularly abrasion-proof and provide protection from adverse weather. The practical 2-way half-length zipper can be opened from the bottom. This provides ventilation while avoiding flapping of the jacket. If you get too hot, you can quickly pack the anorak up in the little chest pocket and attach it to your climbing harness. This allows you to keep it on almost all the time on demanding tours and move freely. Put it on \u2013 leave it on.</p>",
