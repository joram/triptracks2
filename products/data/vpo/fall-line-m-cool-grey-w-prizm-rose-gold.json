  "description": "In skiing and snowboarding, taking the Fall Line refers to the line down a mountain that is most directly downhill. Inspired by Line Miner and fusing the large ?eld of view from a rimless goggle, Fall Line M is the latest addition to Oakley\u2019s \u201cLINE SERIES\u201d of cylindrical style snow goggles. With a mid-sized ?t, Fall Line M is optimized for a wide variety of faces and is engineered to ?t perfectly with most helmets. Designed with Oakley\u2019s Ridgelock Technology, changing lenses is quick and easy while still allowing for a complete lens seal to prevent harsh conditions from penetrating into your goggle.",
