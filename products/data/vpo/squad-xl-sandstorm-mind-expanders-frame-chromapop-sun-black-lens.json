  "description": "The Squad XL is Smith's largest cylindrical goggle. The massive cylindrical lens is made from molded carbonic-x material so it\u2019s tough, but still has Fog-X technology and ChromaPop\u2122 lens innovation for crystal clear vision. The oversized semi-rimless frame is matched with a new, larger strap; complete with fully integrated strap connection point that delivers the function you need without extra moving parts. Essential technology and maxed out size ideal for the best days of riding.",
