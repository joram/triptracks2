  "description": "The Islender was Devold\u2019s first workwear garment, introduced in the 1850s. Made from 100% pure Norwegian wool, it was the most reliable workwear for fishermen fighting some of the harshest weather conditions on the planet. To this day, the Original Islender remains one of Devold\u2019s bestsellers. Its retro feel and natural properties make it a sweater that withstands the winds of time. 100% pure new wool from Norwegian sheep. Tuck-knitted Jacqard to prevent loose threads inside. Comfortable ribbed bottom of the sleeves and body.",
