  "description": "Versatile and lightweight: the Avabag Litric tour 30 zip is a separate stowaway bag that is compatible with all Litric Tour and Litric Freeride base units in the regular variant (without s), and has been specially designed for touring. It can be easily and almost invisibly zipped to the base.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The stowaway bag\u2019s features are perfectly designed for ski tourers: ski, splitboard, and rope attachments as well as an ice axe holder leave nothing to be desired. A circumferential zipper enables quick access to the main compartment, while emergency equipment can be stowed in a separate safety compartment. We have used particularly lightweight but scuff-resistant materials to keep weight down to a minimum.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;***Please note: this the stowaway bag only - litric tour and litric freeride base unit sold separately.",
