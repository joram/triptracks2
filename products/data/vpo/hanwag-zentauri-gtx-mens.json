  "description": "The Zentauri GTX represents the best of decades of professional mountaineering experience. This sturdy, crampon-compatible high-alpine boot has an extremely robust suede upper and a high rubber rand for scree protection, while the GORE-TEX membrane keeps feet warm and dry including at low temperatures. The Vibram sole has additional insulating air chambers that provide extra warmth underfoot. Designed with a narrower climbing zone at the toe for greater precision on rock and self-cleaning lugs to ensure reliable traction and braking performance. The go-to boot for demanding high-alpine mountaineering.",
