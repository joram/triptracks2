  "description": "This base layer set is ideal for kids who like to play in the snow all day. The heavy, ultra-soft fleece base layer offers maximum warmth when your child really needs it, be it for a school ski trip, building a snow fort with friends, enjoying a nice, long walk in the snow as a family, or during any other winter sport they wish to do this season. The elastic waistband on our KOMBI thermal pants and anti-friction flatlock seams on both pieces only add to this base layer set.",
