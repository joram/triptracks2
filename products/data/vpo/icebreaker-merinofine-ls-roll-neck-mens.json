  "description": "The MerinoFine\u2122 Long Sleeve Roll Neck is a premium, slim-fit base layer made with luxuriously soft, 15.5 micron 100% merino wool fibers. Designed with a high neck for added protection from the elements, this high-performance top also features raglan sleeves for added range of motion and thumb-loop cuffs to keep your sleeves in place and provide additional warmth for your hands. Flatlock stitching and forward-set side seams reduce friction when you\u2019re on the move. <br><br>Inspired by nature, icebreaker harnesses the performance qualities of natural fibers to offer an alternative to clothing based on petrochemical synthetics. Merino is an annually renewable fiber that naturally resists odors, keeps you cool when it\u2019s hot and warm when it\u2019s not, and lets your skin breathe for comfort all day, every day.",
