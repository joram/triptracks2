  "description": "Sweat-inducing ascents, steep descents: we developed the col becchei vest for men especially for demanding ski tours in alpine terrain.\n\nIn order to make this athletically cut ski touring vest particularly lightweight, robust and elastic, we use merino naturetec light as the main material: it provides excellent breathability and elasticity yet is still wind-resistant. Tasmanian merino wool on the inner back offers plenty of comfort while naturally regulating the climate. In the front, technical inserts made of a special three-layer warp knit material with a windproof membrane protect against the weather yet remain breathable. And air pockets in the fabric provide optimum insulation. For the sake of the environment, the vest is pfc-free and climate-neutral.\n\nThe details have been tailored to demanding tours in alpine terrain: for example, the front pockets are backpack-optimized and enable quick access at any time. Elastic cuffs provide the arms with freedom of movement while the elastic waist keeps out drafts and snow.\n\nThe col becchei vest for men is the ideal ski touring companion, even in demanding conditions.",
