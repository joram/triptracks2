  "description": "Whether they are climbing, on an alpine tour or mountaineering \u2013 They like companions that do everything with us. That\u2019s why their merino fleece light line is durable, lightweight and, thanks to fine Tasmanian merino wool, comfortable on the skin. Technical features such as backpack-compatible front pockets, bonded frame and gap-closing thumb loops make our no-frills fleece light jacket for men an ideal second layer \u2013 for all seasons. Fine Tasmanian merino wool and inner waffle structure ensure good moisture wicking and feel dry on the skin during arduous activities. The material is also extremely breathable, quick drying and highly stretchable. The outside is smooth, so the material provides less contact surface. <br><br>In addition, the fleece light jacket for men has a full-length zip and two front pockets that provide plenty of room for cold hands or small essentials. The sleeves are held by two thumb loops that will warm your pulse and perfectly seal any gaps.<br>",
