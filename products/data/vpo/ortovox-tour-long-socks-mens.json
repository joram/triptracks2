  "description": "The tour long socks for men are highly comfortable on long, demanding ski tours. No slipping: the ergonomic left and right shaping as well as the elastic double cuff and special ankle-stabilizing zone ensure the perfect fit. Flat toe seams prevent chafing and blisters. Additional cushioning is provided by the padded heel and toe area, which also protects against rubbing and makes these long socks durable and long-lasting. The 360-degree webbing system on the foot regulates moisture wicking and allows the socks to breathe perfectly when the going gets tough. Merino wool means the tour long socks for men are naturally moisture-regulating and odor-neutralizing while also feeling soft against the skin. The ideal long socks for long, strenuous ski tours.",
