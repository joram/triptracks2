  "description": "Durable, dependable and built with an abrasion-resistant blend of merino wool and organic cotton, the Hike Pants breathe efficiently on the trail, in the mountains or while travelling. The pants' comfortable fabric blend naturally resists odours, while hand pockets, rear zip pockets, and thigh zip pockets securely store all your daily essentials. Articulated knees and a gusseted construction provide ample range of motion. <br><br>Inspired by nature, icebreaker harnesses the performance qualities of natural fibres to offer an alternative to clothing based on petrochemical synthetics. Merino is an annually renewable fibre that naturally resists odours, keeps you cool when it\u2019s hot and warm when it\u2019s not, and lets your skin breathe for comfort all day, every day.",
