  "description": "A workhorse of a boot and a cult favorite among hardcore backpackers and hunters, the Tibet GTX is super stable, making it ideal for carrying heavy loads over long distances. Thoughtfully designed features, such as the handy I-Lock lacing cam which allows you to separate the lace tension between the ankle and the top of the foot, will keep your feet comfortable over many miles of tough terrain. The lasted GORE-TEX lining provides durably waterproof/breathable protection against the elements.",
