  "description": "With Keb Wool Padded Jacket, Fjallraven introduces a sustainable wool padding into the Keb range of technical trekking garments. The wool is naturally thermo-regulating, helping to keep a balanced body temperature when work intensity varies. The hood provides cosy warmth in biting winds and four pockets take care of small items. A light and packable insulation jacket that is perfect to layer under a shell jacket when trekking or ski touring in cold conditions",
