  "description": "A sustainable re-imagining of Mountain Hardwear's best-selling ultralight down hoody. Because a hoody is supposed to keep you warm (surprise\u2014this one does!) but what about one that won't heat up the atmosphere? Mountain Hardwear thinks this flying space rock is pretty awesome, and because they want to keep Earth awesome, they made the Ghost Whisperer/2\u2122, which uses trash instead of making more. With completely recycled face and trim fabrics as well as responsibly sourced, RDS-certified down insulation, this layer brings the heat where it's supposed to.",
