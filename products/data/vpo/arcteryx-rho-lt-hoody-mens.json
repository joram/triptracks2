  "description": "A base layer is your system\u2019s foundation. It needs to perform and it needs to be comfortable. Focused for lower output activities in cool temperatures, and made from their brushed Torrent\u2122 stretch polyester, the Rho LT hoody delivers moisture transport, light warmth, and next-to-skin comfort. Its trim fit maximizes fabric performance and layers easily, a chest pocket is sized to secure a smartphone, and the hood provides options - neck warmer, traditional hood, or full coverage balaclava.",
