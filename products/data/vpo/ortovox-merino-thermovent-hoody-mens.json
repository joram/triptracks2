  "description": "Check this out! Ski tourers who like it lightweight will love our thermovent line! Both the hoody and the longsleeve top are made of 99 % fine merino wool and score highly thanks to their clever material structure, because: the mesh structure on the torso and arm areas of these super lightweight base layers provide perfect moisture wicking and ventilation, while the special structure also keeps the wearer nice and warm. A small pack size and perfect weight-to-warmth ratio are the stuff of tourers\u2019 dreams. The tight knit chest area is opaque and the flat knitting technique makes the thermovent line extra sustainable, because no cutting waste is created during production. No more than is absolutely necessary has been knitted.<br>",
