  "description": "The hard-wearing Falketind Heavy Duty Pants are inspired by the original Fj\u00f8r\u00e5 Flex1 and will probably become your go-to favorites for general outdoor pursuits. These new and functional all-rounders have a solid design yet provide great comfort and breathability. They\u2019re made with recycled, flexible polyester Flex\u21221 fabric reinforcement in the knees, seat, and front leg. This ensures a great range of movement, in addition, to keep you sealed when the wind increases or during light showers.<br><br>Features include a custom fit waist system, two hand pockets, a hidden gaitor hook and a practical thigh pocket. They have a full-length two-way zipper running from the waist and down so you can customize the pants to suit your needs; The top half form the hip to the knee is an open construction lined with mesh while the bottom is lined with fabric like a classic gusset. <br><br>This also enables a wider fit from the knee down or an all-over wider fit with ventilation on top. You can also tighten the lower leg with our Velcro adjustment if you\u2019re more into a slim fit. The design is clean, versatile and is suitable for a big variety of outdoor activities.",
