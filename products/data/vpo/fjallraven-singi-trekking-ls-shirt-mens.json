  "description": "Hardwearing shirt with regular fit for trekking and multifaceted outdoor life. Made from unwaxed G-1000 that is pre-washed for a soft feel against the skin. The material wicks away moisture and dries fast giving maximum comfort during sweaty activities. Any excess heat can be released through ventilation openings with net fabric under the arms and in the yoke across the shoulders.<br><br>Two chest pockets and an arm pocket, all with buttoned flaps. Sleeve buttons keep rolled up sleeves in place.",
