  "description": "Warm, breathable, form fitting leggings ideal as a baselayer on cold mountain days. Made with Syncrino\u2122 125 fabric they benefit from a blend of warm, wicking merino and rapid dry synthetic fabric. <br><br>Breathable, soft on the skin and stretchy, with a gusset at the crotch for excellent mobility, the Syncrino Leggings are the perfect first layer for climbing mountains in cold temperatures. Odour resistant and fast drying they\u2019re ideal for multiday adventures.<br><br>Their lightweight Syncrino\u2122 125 fabric is made from a blend of Merino wool and 32% recycled synthetic fibres. Merino wool is ideal for cold weather baselayers. It\u2019s ability to absorb water makes it excellent at wicking sweat away from the skin, maintaining comfort, and regulating body temperature. It\u2019s also a great insulator, even when it\u2019s wet, although it can take a while to dry.<br><br>The man-made synthetic fibres are strong, durable, lightweight, and hold their shape well. They can also dry extremely quickly. By blending these yarns,&nbsp;they have created a quick-drying, fast-wicking, insulating, and durable material that\u2019s ideal for mountain baselayers.",
