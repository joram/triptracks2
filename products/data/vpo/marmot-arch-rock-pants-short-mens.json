  "description": "The Men's Arch Rock Pants are built to handle a full day on the trail. UPF 50 protects your skin from the sun, and a light but durable fabric means you\u2019re cool in the shade. Articulated knees and a crotch gusset mean they'll hold up on serious climbs, and the PFC-free coating will keep you dry when the deluge hits.",
