  "description": "Sweat-inducing ascents, steep descents \u2013 always protected: they developed the col becchei shorts for men especially for demanding ski tours in alpine terrain.<br><br>In order to make these ski touring shorts particularly lightweight, robust and elastic, we use merino naturetec light as the main material: it provides excellent breathability and elasticity yet is still wind-resistant. In the front, technical inserts made of a special three-layer warp knit material with a windproof membrane protect against the weather yet remain breathable. And air pockets in the fabric provide lightweight insulation. For the sake of the environment, the shorts are pfc-free and climate-neutral.<br><br>The shorts\u2019 details have been tailored to ski touring: for example, a dermizax\u00aenx membrane has been used to make the back completely wind- and waterproof. The width-adjustable waistband with drawstring offers easy alterability, and its soft, merino-mix inserts provide increased comfort. Full-length side zippers allow the shorts to be quickly put on and taken off.<br><br>The col becchei shorts for men are the ideal ski touring companion, even in demanding conditions.",
