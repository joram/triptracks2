  "description": "The Kari Traa Rose Light Capri is a thin, lightweight merino wool baselayer that ends below the knee and is an ideal match with ski and other boots when you need minimal layers for a smooth, uncluttered fit. Featuring the classic KT Nordic-inspired floral design, a Jacquard knit elastic waistband, and stretch fabric mapping for improved fit and movement, this slim fit legging is wonderfully warm and next-to-skin soft.",
