  "description": "Huckleberry Rock is on of the most scenic lookouts in Muskoka. These rocks are some of the oldest rock in the world, well over a billion years old. The effects of glaciations, timber harvesting, erosion and fire have removed the thin mantle of soil, exposing the surface of the pink granitic rock. The dry conditions only allow lichens and mosses to become established but afterwards soil particles are trapped allowing grasses, juniper and white pine to germinate and survive. Taken from and more information at: http://www.muskokalakes.ca",
  "directions": "Located between Bracebridge and Port Carling.  From Muskoka Road #118 go to Milford Bay Road. Parking is on the left and is designated with Huckleberry Rock Trail signage.",
