  "description": "This hiking trail will take you to the east end of the Village of Manitou Beach along a fence line.  At the east end you will head towards the lake and continue your journey along a paved highway.  You will then be going west towards Danceland.  Be sure to stop in and say hello and have a coffee that is served daily.  From there you will continue west along the main beach area.  You have several road choices to get back to your starting point and all of them are fairly steep hills.  You can cut this routing shorter by entering Wellington Park from the small berm you will be crossing.  Turn north at that location and you will come to Danceland in approximately 700 meters. There are several go-cache hides along these trail routings.",
  "directions": "For people parked in the Regional Campground, exit through the pedestrian gate at the far end of the campground.  For visitors not in the campground there is ample parking at the community center building that is located just east of the campground.",
