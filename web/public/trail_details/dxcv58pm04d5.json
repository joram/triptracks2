  "description": "Well this waypoint had been in my GPS for over ten years.  I am always suspicious of named falls on topo maps from the SW area of Nova Scotia.  Most of them turn out to be rapids more than anything else.\n\nThe hike or drive is on a logging road that would be a 6km return from pavement.  I was able to drive for the most part and parked about 400m from the fall itself.  There has been lots of logging  so the road is in bad shape.  Once you finish crossing the last logging area the road continues along the river and after climbing a really small uphill, an atv size path on your right will lead you to the tumbling falls.  Basically it is a narrowing of the river with cascade type falls of no more than 3-4ft but still for this area it is as big as it gets and in times f high water would be quite spectacular.",
  "directions": "highway 208 in Colpton.  turn on logging road at N44.45279\u00b0 W64.86126\u00b0 which is about 300m west of the county borders.",
