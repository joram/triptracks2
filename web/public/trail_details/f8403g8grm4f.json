  "description": "It doesn't get any easier than this trail.  It used to be a railroad track but now is an active transportation corridor.  The bonus is that section is off access to motorized vehicle beween coldbrook/Cambrige and Kentville.  The trail crosses a few brooks and parallels the Cornwallis River as it goes throug hstands of evergreen and deciduous trees.",
  "directions": "There are a couple of access points but the start of the non motorized section is off the Cambridge Road which is off highway 1",
