  "description": "World Cup was an unsantioned trail built on Sumas in secret but soon discovered by many.  After an initial political incident with the wood lot owner the FVMBA managed to negotiate an amenable agreement to keep the trail open, but conceded permanent status.  This trail will be destroyed when the wood lot is logged so enjoy it while it lasts.  Note that this is a new trail and due to the loamy ground about half way down, it should not be ridden in the wet - or it won't last long...",
  "directions": "Go south from the Time Killer out or ride North from the access road to the summit on the new logging road about 1km down from the upper gate.",
