  "description": "Steep, rocky, gnarly.  Natural rock rolls, balance lines and woodwork characterize this trail.  Definitely not for anyone who isn't down with the north shore freeride scene.",
  "directions": "Easiest to access from the Lungbuster logging road which starts at the golf course maintenance yard.  Easiest finish is by flowing into Manhandler, followed by Three Pigs and then Mistress.  To stay on Westwood Plateau, turn left at the logging road exit of Mistress.  For another great trail, turn right and hit Academy, but make sure you have planned ahead, because you're ending up at Buntzen Lake.",
