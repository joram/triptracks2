  "description": "This is a great urban paddle with a neat destination in mind to make it bigger and better. (That is to paddle out to Shediac Island)\nWe launched from a park near the wharf in Shediac and paddled as the sun was setting. With the wind and waves, conditions were not ideal, but it was fun just to get out after a hot humid day.",
  "directions": "Off route 133 in the heart of town, turn toward the water at the junction of main street and sackville st. (weldon street?), moasy over to Pleasant street and head to the wharf. We parked and let in by the small beach.",
