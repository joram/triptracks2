  "description": "This is a hike that starts at the gun club at the end of Harper Rd (end of Coast Meridian).  Follow the logging road up the hill past the gate, take the first left and then the second left and you will find yourself on the Woodland Trail.  This track takes you to Sawblade Falls and then Woodland Falls.Parts of the hike detour around the hydro line construction and there is a lot of noise from the gun club, so do not bring dogs that startle easily.  The markers for the Woodland Trail are blue round circles.  There is some signage but it is a very old trail with limited use.",
