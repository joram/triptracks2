  "description": "A short hike along Barrington Bay will take you to an unusual rock formation.   The coast line in these parts is always fairly similar with rocky and or sandy  beaches.  The end point of this hike is a large rock that juts out into the ocean.  There are small passages to explore as well as some kettles to see.  Overall a nice short hike when you are in the Barrington area.",
  "directions": "Highway 309 into Villagedale.  The rock formation is approximately at N43 30.821 W65 32.736.  Unless you bushwack you might want to ask permission of the homeowners closeby.",
