  "description": "A nice short walk on a tributary of Glen brook will lead to a series of falls set in a beautiful stone carved ravine.  The stream crosses a well maintained woods road.  There doesn't seem to be much to explore but after only a 100 ft in the woods or so, the entrance of the ravine starts.  in there there are numerous smaller falls to begin with and the two largest are at the top of the ravine.  You can come back by climbing out of the ravine and back down the wooded slope.   BTW this is the same brook (not the tributary but Glen brook proper) which has a cave system upstream.",
  "directions": "TCH to old mill road near Melford.  Pass the fist main bridge, look for a small stream with a culvert.   The falls are at N45\u00b0 53' 29.4\" W61\u00b0 16' 57.1\"",
