  "directions": "Park along Cedar Hill Road. Follow Whittaker to Norn and turn left, following Norn North-East for a few minutes. Eventually, you'll see an unmarked trail leading straight up the hill to your left. This trail's beginning is often overgrown in the summer months, so pleas refer to the GPS tracks provided for its exact location.",
