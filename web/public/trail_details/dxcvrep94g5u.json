  "description": "This is one of those roadside falls.  Most people will just drive by this spot but it's well worth the stop to explore the numerous drops of the Indian Brook just south of New Germany.  There are a couple of drops and the geology is quite interesting.  Upstream, there are large conifers and the stream is well shaded in spots.",
