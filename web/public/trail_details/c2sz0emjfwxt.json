  "description": "Cornice Ridge Loop above Bridal lake, (it's the partly the same trail as Cornice Ridge but a shorter loop). \nIt's a good place for a rest stop if you are travelling the Creston - Salmo section of Highway 3.\nBasically a short loop. The scenery isn't as notable as the Rockies further north.",
