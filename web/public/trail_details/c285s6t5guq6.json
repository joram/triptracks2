  "description": "Fairly well maintained trail for the majority of the hike. Some of the trail is over rock which can be slippery \rwhen wet or frozen in the winter. This trail can be completed year round but it is necessary to be careful if \rthere is ice. We did the hike with some 7 year old boys who loved it. The time and distance reflects a round \rtrip.",
  "directions": "From Victoria take the Trans-Canada. Prior to Goldstream Park make a left turn on to Humpback Road. \rFollow the signs to Mount Wells Park. Parking is available at the trail head.",
