  "description": "NTS Map:92B12.  Starting on the lake trail, you begin circling the lake counter clockwise, at the first major intersection you leave the park trail and venture towards the mountain on another trail.  Cut through the bush and onto logging roads for a short bit and a well flagged trail will take you to the top.  GPS data is included and recommended.  Hike can be continued down the back side and return via logging roads to make a circle tour.",
