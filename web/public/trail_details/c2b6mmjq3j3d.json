  "description": "This is a backcountry hiking/mountaineering trek which takes the goat ridge and connects with Copilot and on to Skypilot. It is not for the unexperienced or nervous. The trail takes the Petgill lake trail off hwy.99 east of Murrin park and follows the ridge all the way with spectacular views and interesting scrambling.",
  "directions": "Walk on the east  side of hwy.99 for about 100m north of Murrin parks parking. Look for a trail sign and the trail.",
