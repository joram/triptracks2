  "description": "A short hike if you are travelling to Yarmouth.  I am always looking for special places to explore when I travel. The area near Yarmouth doesn?t have many such places but the lighthouse at Cape Forchu is definitely worth exploring.Setting off from the parking lot, the western side of the Cape is this unique rock formation.  The rock surfaces can be walked easily and you can make your way south of the Cape by hugging the shore.  The lighthouse will be to your left and there are numerous places to get some good pictures of the lighthouse and the surroundings.  Towards the end of the Cape, you need to climb around a bit more and if you go at low tide there is a small rocky island you cannot access at any other time.  The eastern side of the Cape is easier to walk and there is an established trail on that side.  A cobble beach is also present on that side.To get to Cape Forchu, follow indications to Yarmouth Bar and then continue south to where the road ends at the lighthouse",
