  "description": "Starting at the magnificent Takakkaw Falls, you will head South (towards Iceline) but veer towards Burgess.  You will walk on a ledge around Mt. Wapta with glorious view of Emerald Lake and Emerald Glacier.  Reach the Burgess Shale area, go up to the protected area ONLY IF YOU HAVE PAID YOUR WAY and are with a guide. Otherwise, continue along the meadow and descend to Field.",
  "directions": "Road to Takakkaw Falls is off Highway 1, between Lake Louise and Field.  Drive to the top.",
