  "description": "I decided to explore this ravine has it looks like it could contain my favorite thing; waterfalls... The start from the road is on a old logging road but soon you are bushwalking to the stream.  Once you hit the stream you travel downstream to see a couple of really small falls (maybe 5ft at best).  Some rocks are pretty cool though with some fossils appearing.  The ravine gets narrow and deep in a few spot but the big falls never materialize.",
