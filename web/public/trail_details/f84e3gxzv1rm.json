  "description": "Not far from the community of Farmington lies an old gold mine adit.    From the satellite imagery, I was expecting a nice walk in a mature hardwood forest.   It starts that way from the dirt road as you descend into a small brook....on the other side of the brook the forest open right up into argh...a clearcut!If you follow the small tributary of Arsenic brook, you cannot miss the big adit entrance.....it's dry inside for the first 20ft or so and then its partially flooded so bring boots if you want to pursue this one further.",
  "directions": "On the Wentworth-Collingwood Rd, turn on Farmington Rd and park approx at 45.590403, -63.899526 and follow my gps track",
