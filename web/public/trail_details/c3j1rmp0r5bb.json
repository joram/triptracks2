  "description": "This is a short and easy hike with a waterfall at the end. Great for families and those wanting to break up the drive and stretch the legs while making their way up to Bugaboo.The trail passes gently through the forest and soon gives way to slightly obstructed views of the falls. There are places where you can venture off the main trail to gain a better look at the waterfall but watch your footing, a fall could be very costly.",
  "directions": "From Highway 95 heading North, turn left onto Westside Rd after Spillimacheen. Continue on Westside Rd, the trail head will be on the left identified by a Forestry Recreation trail sign.",
