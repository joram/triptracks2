  "description": "The Petrie Island Convervation area has a short trail up that runs west along the Ottawa River.  The trail ends in a nice open area Gazebo that overlooks beaver ponds.  The highlight of the trail is a lookout where you can view turtles sunning themselves.  I've counted fourteen turtles on one log at this lookout.",
