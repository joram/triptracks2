    "description": "The Mosquito Creek Trail begins at Fell and 16th Avenue in North Vancouver and follows the Mosquito Creek Ravine up Grouse Mountain to where the power lines cross the Creek.  Nicely secluded in an urban environment, the trails is a haven for dog owners, and can be ridden on a mountain bike in the uphill direction only.  \nMore information on other sections of the Mosquito Creek Trail:\nMosquito Creek Cascades\nBaden Powell - Grouse Mountain to Mosquito Creek\nMosquito Creek",
    "directions": "The Mosquito Creek Ravine can be accessed at many points along the trail.  However, for first-timers, it's probably best to start at one end and walk/hike/ride the whole thing.  The trail can be accessed most easily from the park at Fell and 16th Street, just north of Marine Drive.  If you'd rather start at the top, catch a bus that gets you on Montroyal Avenue, where it crosses the Creek.  You'll know to get off when you see the fire station on the north side of the road.",
