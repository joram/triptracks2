    "description": "Nice easy hike along Holland Creek behind Ladysmith and then up a very steep but relatively short section to Heart Lake.  The lake is small but pretty.  Its about 3k to the lake one way.  From Heart Lake you can choose to return on the same route or go for a longer hike around Stocking Lake.  \r\rAll trails are well established and marked except for the section under the power lines where you leave the Holland Creek trail, go past a pumping station and small pond and walk down a logging road.  When you get to the intersection of another logging road turn right and follow it along until you get to the very well marked sign which marks the beginning of the Heart Lake trail.",
    "directions": "Driving north on the Island Hwy into Ladysmith turn left on Roberts St and follow it to the end, turn left on 6 ave and park beside the RCMP station.  The Holland Creek trail is directly behind the RCMP station.",
