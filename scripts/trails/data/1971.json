    "description": "NTS Map: 082J07Elevation Gain: 679 m (2,228 ft) to Loomis Lake.Loomis Creek, is ride #68 in Doug Eastcott's book \"Back Country Biking in the Canadian Rockies\".Most of the trail follows an old but very overgrown logging road.The scenery isn't fantastic as most of the time you are in the trees. About 2km from Loomis Lake the trail becomes steep hence it's best to hike the last 2 km to Loomis Lake. We didn't make it to the lake, note GPS data attached indicates where we stopped. Editor's Note Aug  2008: Did make it to the lake this weekend.  New GPS data attached.  And Google Maps has all high-res photos of this area, check out the preview.The return trip downhill is great fun.This is good ride for a hot day as it requires 7 creek crossings. The water is cold.",

(About 12km N of the Highwood Junction or 44km South of the Winter Closing Gate at Peter Lougheed Park (which in turn is 50km S of Hiway 1).Cross road and look for a gated fire road to the North about 100m.Ford Highwood at KM 1.6, ford Loomis Creek 3.0Near a dry crossing at km 3.0 stay left, right is trail to Odlum Pond.",
