    "description": "Very nice and unexpected fall near Antrim.  Nothing really around here to indicate a fall but using my waterfall instinct (lol), I was able to find a 20 ft drop (total height combination).  Right now the brooks are dry but it would look very good at high flow.  \n\nfrom a well maintained dirt Rd (Antrim Rd),hike along an ATV/ logging road until a secondary path on your right goes down a significant hill.  at the bottom is the brook and fall immediately downstream.  It is set in a pretty good looking mature evergreen stand.",
