    "description": "This is a place I had been before and I was surprised I hadn't posted it on trailpeak.  Maybe it's because it's a short hike from the road (about 300m) but the reward is a beautiful but unexpected 30ft waterfall.The family and I had finished an amazing sugar bush meal at Sugar Moon Farm and we were looking for a last adventure and to burn off the delicious maple syrup  before heading back to town.I remembered seeing this fall a few years back when I first started with this addiction.  You park your car on the road above the fall and then spot the faint trail going towards it.  The trail is pretty steep so be careful.  That being said my 5 and 8 year olds managed fine.  It's a softwood stand all the way and its easy enough to see where you need to go.    Down by the stream side there is a natural little area that just perfect to relax on and admire the view.",
    "directions": "Highway 311 to Earltown.  Turn on highway 326 and park right after crossing the MacKays Mill stream.   Head in the forest on the north side of the stream as it affords the best view of the fall.",
