    "description": "An easy 2.7km hike to Placid Lake in Wells Gray Park.  Continuing past the lake, another 1.8km will connect you to approximately 2.6km on  the Whitehorse Bluffs Trail  http://trailpeak.com/trail-Whitehorse-Bluffs-near-Clearwater-BC-2508\r\rThe trail passes through mature Cedar and Hemlock forests with some impressive Douglas Fir and Black Cottonwood veterans scattered throughout.  There are no campsites available at the lake.  As with most areas of Wells Gray, bring plenty of mosquito repellent during the summer months.",
    "directions": "The Placid Lake trailhead is right at the junction of Clearwater Valley Rd and Green Mtn Road, approximately 38km from the Hwy 5 turnoff in Clearwater.  The road is usually plowed to Helmcken Falls in the winter months, allowing for 4 season use.",
