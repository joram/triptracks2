The GPS includes the main trail to the peak, a loop to Peden Lake, and a diversion to Grass Lake. The GPS also includes a 1.5km bushwacking path for the stuborn who want to head to the peak and don't want to retrace their steps after visting Grass Lake. This later \"path\" is not for the faint of heart.\r\rThe trail steadiy gains elevation. You will cross a few creeks over the course of the trip. \r\rDirect path to the peak is around 14km. With loops, the trip is around 18km.\r\r\r\r",
    "directions": "Turn right off the highway between Victoria and Sooke unto Sooke River Road. The trail starts on your right after approximately 4km. Watch for a gate with a sign stating \"no motorized vehicles.\"",
