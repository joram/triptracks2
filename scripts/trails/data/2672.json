    "description": "NTS Map: 082N08The trail for Fairview Mountain starts at the parking lot at the Lake Louise Chateau. From the parking lot walk towards the canoe rental kiosk and take a left on the asphalt trail.  This is the start of the Fairview Lookout, Fairview Mountain and The Saddleback Trails.  Keep going straight at any junctions that you encounter. The trail to the Saddleback is 3.5 km and has an elevation gain of 600 m.  After 0.8 km there is a junction that takes you to Fairview Lookout (right trail), The Saddleback and Fairview Mountain (center trail), and a trail that leads to the Paradise Valley Trail (left trail).The trail goes through some avalanche paths, forested areas and open meadows. About 3 km later with many switchbacks and elevation gain you will have climbed the Saddleback.  From here you can go left onto the Sheol Valley Trail or right to Fairview Mountain.The trail to Fairview Mountain is not clearly defined.  The trail is full of switchbacks up a steep slope made up of loose scree.  The 1.5 km trail gains an elevation of 444 m.  At the summit, you will be 1 km above Lake Louise and have great views of Mt. Temple and Mt Victoria.Word of caution:  This mountain is also nicknamed \"Overtime Mountain\".  Many people try to scramble down the northeast side as a shortcut on the way back.  This is a sure way to spend the night on a ridge and be billed for a rescue the next morning.In winter please check the local avalanche conditions and bulletins.",
