    "description": "From Warner lake the trail consists of somewhat technical single track. It continues past Trigger and Hummingbird lakes.  Some fun down hill sections. From there the trail gets less technical and follows Gun Creek further down the valley. We took a detour up to the camping spot at the southern end of Spruce lake for lunch. The final leg of the trail was down High Trail. This kicked us out on the forestry road where we had parked the truck earlier that day.Terrain and trail vary along the way from smooth dirt tracks through the trees, to technical rock slides to pick your way through, to dusty sweeping downhill track through meadows.",
    "directions": "Take float plane from Tyax resort to Warner lake. Trail starts just above the dock.  See the attached GPS data.",
