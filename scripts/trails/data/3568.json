    "description": "This single track mountain bike trail goes down the south side of Ledgeview Mountain. It is extremely well built and is usually pretty ridable even if most of the rest of Ledgeview is muddy.",
    "directions": "On Mckee road, pass the golf course to a muddy hole on your right. Go to the gate and to the top of Ledgeview.  At the bench take the west entrance.  There are a couple of forks, keep to the right. You will then hit an open trail and run into a wooden gate.  Chuck your bike over.  Look left.  On the west side of the road you are on the trail continues.  There is a fork on this path that is easy to miss.  Go over the road again.  The trail continues straight across.",
