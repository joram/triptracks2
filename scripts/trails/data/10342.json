    "description": "Mount Sether is located across the lake from the Ethel Lake Campground. \nHalf way up Mount Sether are a couple of large rocks that look like army \ntrucks from the campground. There is no developed trail but a moderately steep gradient ridge line can be followed. The majority of the hike is through small trees in ankle to knee deep moss. The trail has approximately 530 m of vertical over 2.4 km. The hike up is not much fun the the scenery is amazing.\nAlthough not mapped, the hiking gets easier to the top of the mountain if \nyou do not mind another 335 m of vertical over 2.8 km.",
    "directions": "The turn off to Ethel Lake is located 10 km south of Stewart Crossing, Yukon on the North Klondike Highway. The Ethel Lake Road is a 24 km long, narrow dirt road. The road is normally easily passable but can be a concern for motor homes and trailers during wet weather as the road can get rough and there are some steep grades. The lake crossing is approximately 1.6 km and a boat or canoe is required. The lake can however get rough so a canoe crossing should only be attempted in nice weather.",
