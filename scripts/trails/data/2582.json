    "description": "This is a little body of water that feeds into the ocean at Cribbons Beach.\r\n\r\nIt's a great piece of calm water to relax either in the morning or early evening, when shore winds have subsided.\r\n\r\nYou'll see eagles, king fishers and harons out looking for food along the shore and in the trees.\r\nPaddle under the bridge to explore the marsh area, and the streams that feed it.\r\n\r\nWhether you're out to practice your strokes, or out to explore, South Lake in Lakevale is worth dipping your paddle into.",
    "directions": "Follow the 337 on the sunrise Trail, and look for the bridge at Lakevale. It's next to the Fisherman's Crossing B&B.",
