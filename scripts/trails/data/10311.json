    "description": "Beautiful, buffed new trail with excellent signage, all compliments of the hard working crew at CMBA - Calgary Mountain Bike Alliance.\nThis newly constructed ribbon of singletracky goodness intersects good 'ole Tom Snow in 4 or 5 places but bypasses all the sucky parts of TS and cuts out a couple mindless grunts and replaces all of that with technical singletrack.\nIt ties into Moosepackers, Diamond T, Tom Snow and some other trails on the drafting board.  What makes a good ride is up Sulphur Springs to Pneuma, up Pneuma to Moosepackers, down Moosepackers to the top of Tom Snow/Ridgeback, Down Ridgeback to the cold ones in your cooler at Station Flats (24km & ~1000m cumulative climbing - you'll deserve the cold ones).",
    "directions": "Station Flats parking lot would be the usual choice, but you could also get to the top of it from West Bragg and up the gated road to Tom Snow.",
