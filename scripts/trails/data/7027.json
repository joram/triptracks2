    "description": "Rattlin Brook falls trail is a half K hike that takes you up to a great view of an 800 foot waterfall. The trail consists of a gravel path, as well as steps and viewing platforms for terrific views of the falls. What surprised me was the presence of a tent platform and outhouse. Pinch me! One usually finds these on longer routes, but you can make this a camping destination in of its self.\nThe water color is copper in color. This is created by tanic acid leached from the surrounding soil. This colorization is common to fresh waterways in Newfoundland and Atlantic Canada.\nShannon Burt\nEast coast editor",
    "directions": "Off Route 391, just past the Alexander Murray trail, head past Kings Point into the community of Rattlin Brook. Look for the signs on the left before the bridge at Corner Brook cove.",
