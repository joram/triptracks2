    "description": "This is a hike or mountain bike trail you can do along the top of the cliffs at Cape St Mary's near Yarmouth.  There is an ATV trail all along the topo of the cliffs you can follow.  The cliffs are a good 40-60ft high and so be careful on windy days.  the material on the cliffs is mostly slate so not good for climbing.  Close by you can also visit the beautiful sandy beach at the provinical park.  More of a leg stretcher or pic nic spot than an all out hike but you can probably follow the top0 of the cliffs all the way to the Deveau shore sea cave and that would be an all day adventure for sure!",
    "directions": "Highway 1.  Turn on Cape St Mary's Rd and then right on lighthouse Rd.  Park at the lighthouse and walk east......",
