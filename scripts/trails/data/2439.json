    "description": "The Corkstown Trail system can be accessed via P3 parking. Trail 11 and 12 are well indicated. It is located on the side of the Shirleys Bay Conservation Area. Not on the side of the Stony Swamp Conservation Area. Reference NCC map. Going there during a night bike ride. Make sure you have a powerful light system. It is rocky, a lot of multiple long sequence of roots trees, some downhill or type of roller coaster.\r\nFun and cool. Landscape is amazing. Bring a helmet video camera and a camera if you can. This little system does not really have a name but since it is connected to Corkstown Rd and only 1 parking at P3, why not call this system Corkstown.",
    "directions": "Via Moodie Drive, turn on Corkstown Rd. Corkstown Rd can be accessed via March Rd in Kanata.",
