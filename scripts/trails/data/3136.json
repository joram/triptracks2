    "description": "The trail is officially for guests of Bayview Wildwood Resort. It starts from the road opposite the resort (Torpitt Lodge Road). It's a somewhat interesting summer hike but an especially nice snowshoe trip if the snow is deep. The first loop is packed by the resort. The outer loop is not packed or tracked but there are enough signs on trees to follow it. The second part has excellent hills for snowshoes and a real wilderness experience out on the open barrens. A related trip is the excellent, tracked, cross-country ski trail, called the Oak Ridge Trail, traversing open ridges and bogs to an isolated cabin. No snowmobiles or ATVs are allowed on any trail.",
    "directions": "Go north on South Sparrow Lake Road in Washago from Highway 11 (north of Orillia and south of Gravenhurst, closer to Orillia at Hawkins Corners. After about 10 km on S. Sparrow Lake Road you come to a crossing to Port Stanton Parkway and the resort - don't take it but enter Torpitt Road. The resort has parking near the tracks across from the resort (see GPS track). Staying at the resort gives access to considerable terrain that is appropriate for GPS-based activity. Signs indicate that trails are for guests only.
