    "description": "I was really surprised when we went here.  Brockville is 110 kms from Ottawa but had some really nice riding.  Mostly the first part is XC style with single track, large rocks to climb, short uphills and some technical downhills.  You are basically riding the exposed Canadian shield.  If you continue a little farther into the trail you can reach drop areas, structures and lots of fun things to ride.  Compared to Kanata lakes this isn't as difficult but was a fun ride to be sure.",
    "directions": "HWY 416 to the 401, follow 401 to Brockville.  Exit Stewart and then follow Central Avenue west until the road ends by the Black & Decker building.  Trail starts there.",
