    "description": "NTS Map: 092J02\nThere are a number of multi-use trails surrounding Lost Lake, and, although we can't remember how we got there, we lucked out and found some nice bike trails branching off this network that took us along some rolling terrain with good elevation drop and gain.  Forgot to bring the GPS that day, I suppose we lived up to the Lake's name (but you can't possibly get lost in there). We found a nice rock playground with a view of the village and nearby mountains, proving that if you look around, you'll find some decent trails off the gravel path.  This was a nice vantage point with some slick-rock to practice on.  All of the pictures come from the Lost Lake area (which might have been renamed mirror lake on that day). If you've only got a few hours before heading out of town, or, you're not quite up to ramps and ladders, or are hungover, and espedcially if you answer yes to each of these, then explore this area.",
