    "description": "Newish trail that you can book across the main access road and keep on S.O.B.  short, but jam packed full of flowy lanches and even dirt jumps, including the infamous 45 foot gap.  Super fun stuff, but stay within your limits on it ... I'm typing here with a shattered wrist because of a 30ish foot gap on this trail :(  still, one of the better trails on Ledgeview.",
    "directions": "take Mckee road up past the golf course, park on the right just past the tree farm.  From there go though this mud pit (if its been raining) and past the yellow gate on the main road.  Keep on going past the second gate, past the old washing machine (look left there, thats where this trail comes out) head up about another 10 mins or so until you come to his sharp right turn, go left there, and there's your entrance ... after you're done you can book it right across and keep doing S.O.B.",
