    "description": "I always had a hunch there could be a fall on this brook. Over the years I have explored a lot of the brooks in the hills near Glendale and found a lot of falls and sometimes found...nothing!  Winter 2019 and I don't have much time to get back to Dartmouth so I decided to check this spot I had in my GPS.  It's only about 500m from the TCH.   There were houses on both sides of the brook but nothing was plowed leading to them so I didn't go knocking on a door BUT I would do that if I went back in spring or summer.I followed the brook closely, staying far from either houses and after about 12minutes, I was in front of a beautiful two tier, 30ft waterfall in a place I would not have expected to see anything!",
    "directions": "Park 3km east of River Denys Mtn Rd on the TCH where it crosses MacLennan Brook at; N45 50 40.6 W61 16 50.8.   Follow the brook upstream to the fall.",
