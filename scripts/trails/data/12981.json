    "description": "To access Bull Creek Hills, first head to Grass Pass and then veer off on the faint trail to the east, further uphill.  Continue to follow the faint trail along the ridge heading northeast to the high point. From here, you can return the same way you came, or you can continue along the ridge and make a loop of it.  The loop requires walking back on the road for about 3 km, or two cars for a shuttle.  Water is scarce after snowmelt.",
    "directions": "Head from Longview towards Highway 40 and park near the 2013 washout on the south of the road.  Alternatively some people park on the shoulder directly at the trailhead.",
