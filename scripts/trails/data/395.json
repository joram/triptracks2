    "description": "Submitted by: Ernie the trail dog (actually submitted by Margaret, but Ernie is the poster dog). \r\nThe mountain bike trails just west of the Crumpet woods provide spectacular views, some challenging obstacles, and otherwise great cross-country riding that Squamish has become popular for. Trails in this little circuit include:\r\n\n Dopes Drop\n Pipeline\n summer's Eve\n Edno\n Seven Stitches\n\n\r\nFollow the map above, which generally identifies waypoint markers to trails of interest. Click on \"Download GPS\" for an image of the above points. GPS reception is good in Squamish.\r\nParking area is the same parking area as those who climb the Smoke Bluffs, which are visible from town, or at the west end of Plateau Dr.\r\n\r\nMore detail coming on this trail combination shortly, by the photographer and GPS mule (sorry Margaret), Margaret Wilson. Stay tuned.\r",
