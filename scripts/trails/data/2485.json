    "description": "This is a trail for all the family, probably the easiest on Fromme.  It can be taken as a high speed cruiser (watch for hikers), a more technical alternative to climbing the road, or a leisurely ride.  The trail is of moderate grade, with a few roots, small steps, and fun rocks to practice your skills on.More Mt Fromme mountain biking trails can be found here.",
    "directions": "At the top of Mountain Hwy in North Vancouver, park south of the orange locals only parking signs. Ride up to the end of the road and enter the park throught the first gate.  The entrance for climbing (north) Roadside is the second one on the right after the turnaround gate.  The downhill (south) entrance can be found on the right just before the corner of the first switch back.  Heading north will get you onto the Cedar Trail, and also get you to the entrance to Upper Griffen.  Roadside follows the road south.",
