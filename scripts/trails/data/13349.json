    "description": "One of my favorite hike to do within a half hour of Halifax.  Not sure why I\u2019m posting though\u2026it\u2019s so nice to have some secret spots!   However it is also nice to share some of these hidden gems to like minded people!\nYes we do have an entry in trailpeak to Pollys Cove but this is very much different as this post will lead you to a fantastic little place called Crack in rock cave.  Ok, it\u2019s not a cave in the true sense but it is still amazing.  The granite rock here as a fairly long crack of over 20 ft in height and perhaps 200ft long.  You can actually enter the crack go to the end of the straight line where the crack does a 90 degree turn before doing a small ascension of the 20 ft.  At the end of the day, you pop out of a small hole in the shrubs looking like a gopher!",
