    "description": "A little known waterfall is located on Gairloch Brook.  Traveling down the dusty roads nearby you would never expect to see a large waterfall of about 60feet hidden in the woods approximately 200m from the road.  Setting off near the church, you circumvent the cemetery and then start proceeding down-slope through the mixed forest.  Pick your spots carefully as there are some areas that have dense growth of trees while others are easy to navigate.  As soon as you get low enough you should hear the roar of the water.  The waterfall cascades more than drop along the rock face.  This means that you can actually climb into the fall when the water is warm enough.  I went back towards my car from the top of the waterfall,  there is a large boggy area at the top that you need to circumvent.  You can also easily spot the white marks in satellite imagery so you have a sense  of scale of this thing.",
