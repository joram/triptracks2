    "description": "NTS Map: 092G06If you are on Bowen for the weekend, perhaps visiting friends, consider going up Mount Gardner for a hike or ride, or, an easier stroll around Crippen Park. The hike with detailed directions is posted under a different trail (click MOUNT GARDNER),this description is for Crippen regional park.\r\n\r\nBowen is a great place to unwind for the day, giving you that Island feeling with only a short ferry ride from Horseshoe Bay.  Perhaps ride in the morning and then rent a kayak in the afternoon, catching the late ferry home for dinner.  While on Bowen, there is a nice hike around Kilarney Lake, in the same area as the mountain trail we're talking about, but no bikes are allowed around Kilarney. So if you are visiting the Island with some walkers, let them go to Crippen Park while you cruise (grunt) up Mount Gardner. \r\n\r\nDirections to Crippen are as per attached map to Killarney Lake.",
