    "description": "The Goodwood Marsh Nature Trail is a new completed trail in Beckwith.  Hard packed small gravel on the main trail, with smaller trails that have hard packed dirt.  There is one trail to the south, which consists of large gravel, but it is uneven and not travelled, therefore there is some overgrowth.",
    "directions": "From Ottawa, ON, Drive west on Hwy 7 (until Carleton Place), Turn right at Hwy 15 (south), turn left at 9th Line, until you reach Beckwith Park.  You can park at either the trail head on the west side (near the football field) or on the east side (near the soccer fields).",
