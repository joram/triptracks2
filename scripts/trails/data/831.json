    "description": "NTS Map:92F11.  This is an easy 8km (2 hour) walk on a boardwalk with an elevation gain of about 70 m.  It takes you past Battleship Lake, sub-alpine meadows and around beautiful Lake Helen McKenzie.  At every junction there is a direction map and a  -you are here - arrow on it.  Views are not fantastic since the heavy forests block most of the peaks.  You can get glimpses every so often which are awesome.  This is a really nice introduction into Vancouver Island hiking.  The gray jays (birds) are very aggressive and well try to eat your lunch while you are eating it!",
    "directions": "Forbidden Plateau: The main access route to Forbidden Plateau from Courtenay and Campbell River is via the Paradise Meadows Trailhead at Mount Washington.
