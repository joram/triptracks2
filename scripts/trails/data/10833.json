    "description": "This is a small coastal hike you can do without leaving the city.  At the southern edge of Dartmouth, in Eastern Passage, lies a small piece of coastal land which you can easily hike.  There are portions of trails on grass while most of the time you will be walking on rock slabs or cobble size rocks.  The scenery is gorgeous with expansive views of Devil's Island and the outer Halifax Harbour.  Lots of old lobster trap to check out.",
    "directions": "Drive the circumferential highway in Dartmouth towards Eastern Passage.  Follow the highway 322 past the refinery, Shearwater.  In Eastern Passage turn right on Shore Rd and drive towards the Hartlen Point Golf course.  Park on the side of the ocean and begin walking",
