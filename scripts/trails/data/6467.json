    "description": "Mount Windsor east of Deeks Lake (see link below).  This is a recommended hike but is popular in winter with snowshoers. It is also a decent backcountry ski trip from the lake. The problem for skiers is the section from the road to Porteau until the lake. The trail was not really designed with skiing in mind so generally you'll end up carrying skis and perhaps postholing. Once the snow is deep enough you can skin up no problem but it's expert level skiing below Deeks Lake due to the trees and lack of a decent ski trail.\nLink: Deeks Lake.\nFrom the lake to Windsor-Deeks col, the trail traverses nicely and is a really good ski descent, albeit at an advanced level. The last 100 meters to the summit is a narrow ridge and requires a few jump turns to get off the summit.",
    "directions": "Take Highway 99 north from Horseshoe Bay to the Porteau exit. Park and hike to Deeks Lake. At the lake the Mount Windsor trail heads east up to the pass between Deeks Peak and Mount Windsor.",
