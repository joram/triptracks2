    "description": "This a very short hike but the reward is a mostly unknown and tall waterfall located close to North Sydney.  BTW the location of this fall was shared to me by Trevor F.  Many thanks!As you drive down the road and spot the guardrail, nothing can predict the awesome fall hidden nearby.  I parked on an old overgrown road on the south side of Hillside Boularderie Rd.  As soon as I stepped out of the car I heard the roar of the fall (it?s a very wet autumn!)  The fall is basically just there but now you have to pick your own path down the very steep slope of the ravine.   The slopes are covered by ferns and fallen leaves making it very slippery.  I would judge the fall to be in the 40-50ft range.  The brook is not very long so only go there after a significant rainfall. The length of the hike is easy but the slope puts into the moderate category.",
    "directions": "Drive on Hillside Boularderie Rd to where it intersects St James Rd.  The brook is a further 200m southwest of the intersection.  The fall is approximately at;  N46.22836\u00b0 W60.40992\u00b0.",
