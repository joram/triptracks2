    "description": "This describes how to reach some falls on the Mill Brook near Canaan (NS).  I started the hike on a dirt road which is gated but you can easily bypass on foot.  You follow a field for a while on your left until you enter an evergreen forest.  I took the first major trail I met on the right and followed it down to the brook and followed the brook downstream to the falls.  Walking is fairly easy and on level ground the whole way.  After taking a few pictures, I noticed some flagging tape and followed it to another dirt road.  I followed this road until I was back where I veered off the main path at the start.  There seem to be a lot of different dirt paths to explore by bike or x-country skis.",
    "directions": "Highway 103 to the windsor Rd exit (Highway 14).  Highway 14 North to Canaan Rd on right.  From Canaan Rd turn right on David Collicut Rd.  Park near the end and follow dirt rd.",
