    "description": "This was a waterfall exploration gamble.  I never heard of waterfalls on this brook but the topo map for that area show a lot of contours AND brooks located close to it have some pretty good waterfalls such as delanceys brook or eel weir brook falls.I started on an old logging road and followed it until a Y intersection.  At this point, I descended int the ravine in front of me.  To my dismay, lot of old car parts etc are scattered in he woods and brook.  I pushed on and saw some smaller falls which had some deadfall in them.  Then things got worse..I could see an old freezer on the side of the hill.  I pushed on further upstream and finally starting to see some decent falls.  Then the best fall of them all, a nice 12ft straight drop with rocks walls on either side.  Further upstream more falls each very scenic.  The last fall I explored was just passed the power line corridor.",
    "directions": "Highway 201.  Park at old logging road which is directly in front of the intersection of highway 201 and Mt Hanley Rd.  Best fall is at approx; N44.88083 W65.10189.",
