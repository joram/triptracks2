    "description": "Big Snagtooth is one of the Washington Top 100 highest peaks and is located near Washington Pass in the North Cascades. It is easily accessible off of Highway 20 and there is ample parking in a large turnout (after the road opens in spring) You will need to find a log crossing at Early Winters Creek which you can hear from Highway 20.There is no trail and there is some bushwacking and route-finding to be had. You will likely not see another party the entire day. Once you achieve Snagtooth Ridge, through choss and loose rock, you hang a left and head for the Snagtooth. There is a nasty gully approach or a short rock climb via the rappel route. At the summit there is a fun bouldery move to attain the true summit. It has been said that Fred Beckey had to stand on his friends shoulder to get up.",
    "directions": "Big Snagtooth is climbed from the North Cascades Highway. From the summit of Washington Pass (3 hours from Seattle) continue east on Highway 20 for 3.5 miles and pull off at a pull-out on the right side of the road at 4,320 feet.",
