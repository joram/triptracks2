    "description": "This walk/hike is a 14k ramble around the White Rock/South Surrey area. It has good variety including several parks, some urban areas, the famous boardwalk and pier in White Rock, and even has about 160m of elevations. \nThe GPS download will take you on a great trip all around the area. Note that the GPS lost contact on the left portion near the water, but just follow the park trail down.",
    "directions": "This adventure started at the corner of 152nd Ave and Pacific Ave in White Rock. To get there from Vancouver, take Hwy 99 south, then either of the White Rock exits to 152nd Ave, turn right to Pacific Ave.",
