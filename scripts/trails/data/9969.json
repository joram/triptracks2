    "description": "I rated this difficult because we did it in the winter while trail breaking most of the route. Because I go scrambling and hiking relatively often it was moderate for me but if you are used to flat areas with less elevation gain in the winter than this trip may be difficult for you because you are summitting a peak after all. \nParking is at the Helen Lake Parking lot right beside Bow Lake. From there you cross the street and the trail head is at the outhouses. You follow this for a couple of km but then break left off the main trail eventually You are pretty much gaining elevation until you reach the 2 summits and then its pretty easy to find your way back. Follow the gps route attached. \nIts a popular backcountry ski area so you may see many trails to the summit.",
