    "description": "This is the best way to bike to the falls. Whereas the trail from the Jasper side is an old fire road from Rock Lake it is singletrack with technical, root gardens, rock gardens and open medows with wonderful views all around. Plus at km 19.3, the Willow Creek Warden Station is there where patrols still stay.",
    "directions": "From Hinton head west to the Highway 40 turn, take a right then follow till the Rock Lake turn, turn left then on gravel road about 35 km to Rock Lake. Then proceed to the Wildhay Staging area.  Then take the Wildhay trail for 1.7 km take a left - sign is posted then on your way to Snake Indian Falls.",
