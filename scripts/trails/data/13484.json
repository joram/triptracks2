    "description": "Another great valley to explore off the Crowdis Mountain Road.  After exploring a for  while I have visited many of the valleys that are on the east side of the Crowdis Mtn Rd and drain to the Baddeck river system\u2026..Spoiler alert; they never fail to contain some amazing waterfalls for those who dare to go places without trails!\n\nThis valley is accessible via Warehouse Rd which is a cross between an ATV path and a logging road.  Drives as far as you can until your GPS point towards the valley.  Pick carefully as the forest has been logged in places so pick a spot where you still have a mature forest.  Hike about 600m to the lip of the valley and then prepare to go downhill for a while.\n\nI ended right at a fall that although only has drops of 10 and 15 ft has carved an impressive drop through solid rock.   I then took a gamble and went upstream a few hundred meres and was rewarded by a gorgeous 25 to 30 ft drop.",
