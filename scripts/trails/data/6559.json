    "description": "The start of the trail is blocked off by a gate and for the next 3km or so it is a wide ATV or maybe snowmobile trail.  I took my mountain bike to save time since the ultimate goal is a waterfall at about 3km from the starting point.   the brook you need to follow to get to the fall crosses the main road at approximately;  45.515950\u00b0, -63.233129\u00b0\nThe first part is through an evergreen forest qwith some pretty big trees but there are also some small shrum size ones that impede your way.  Close to the ravines edge the forest opens up a bit more and the walking is easier.  This fall is tall enough that you could have fun ice climbing on it.  The rocks are pink with black spots  and that probably means something to geologist type people.  I ended up going down the ravine on the right hand side of the stream  (if facing upstream) and you have to be careful beacuse it is quite steep",
    "directions": "Take highway 311 north of Truro and drive to Central North River.  Turn left on Cross Rd and drive about 1km to dirt road on right.  Park there and moutain bike or  hike about 2.5km where you will cross a brook.  Head downstream for a couple of hundred meters and you will be on top of a significant waterfall",
