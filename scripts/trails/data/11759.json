    "description": "Undeveloped trail portion of ECT. There's a rope for one quick climb/scramble. Cold, icebergs, very unique and remote lunch at Cripple Cove. One big, long climb on the way there. You get to the top then go all the way back down to Cripple Cove. Then loop back to the Cape an easier way ;)",
    "directions": "Pick up trail at Cape St. Francis as per ECT website. It is a loop.",
