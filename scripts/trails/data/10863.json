    "description": "These ski trails at the golf course cover the a whole gamut from beginner to advanced and as you can see from the map I include in the photos you can do anywhere from 5km to 10km loops.  There are three cabins, Alpine 1, Alpine 2, and Kirby cabin.  The cabins all have wood burning stoves, firewood, axes, kindling, candles, and tables.  The Kirby cabin is the newest and nicest.",
    "directions": "From the road entering Mackenzie (hwy 39) take a right at Cicada and take it right to the end which will be the Mackenzie Golf Course parking lot.  Ski trail head is right by the Golf Clubhouse.",
