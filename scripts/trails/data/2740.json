    "description": "NTS Map: 092J02\r\nPeak to Creek, or for the really hardy, Creek to Peak.\r\n\r\nThis is a substantial hike at Whistler, from the Peak to Creekside, or if  you're really hardy, from Creekside to the Peak.\r\n\r\nIt's 1500 el change (up or down)over 10 kms.\r\n\r\nWe did it going down, which isn't necessarily that easy. In fact, our knees were screaming with pain the last 2-3 kms. On the other hand, if you're going to go up. make sure it's a cool day, or you'll bake (carry lots of water).\r\n\r\nIf you go down, take the Gondola ($30) from Whistler Village and follow the GPS data down. You can then take the bus back to the village for your car (or, leave your car there, take the bus to the village and the gondola up).\r\n\r\nIf you go up, start at Creekside, but make sure you arrive at the Peak before 4 pm to take the chair down to the village, and the bus back to Creekside. \r\n\r\nIn the winter, you can ski it down.",
    "directions": "Go to Whistler BC, and find Creekside and the Gondola, your 2 points (start and finish, depending on which way you do the hike).",
