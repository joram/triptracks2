You can access the trail from the Stump Lake parking lot and the Alice Lake south beach area.The trail takes you through Douglas fir, western red cedar and other coniferous and deciduous trees. Some of the birds that can be seen are warblers, Steller's jay, chickadees and robins. Small animals such as raccoons, squirrels and chipmunks inhabit the forest and are more apt to be seen by visitors. A few box turtles have been spotted sunning themselves on logs at Alice Lake and Stump Lake.The trail is closed to cycling from May 1st to September 15th. Please be prepared. Make sure you have plenty of water and snacks with you while you are on the trail. Proper footwear is recommended.",
