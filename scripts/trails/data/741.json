    "description": "Cow Trail: \r\nStarting from the parking lot at the meadows, you follow a road for the first 0.5 km, before heading off left.  This is a well marked trail, single and double track, with a technical rating for beginners.  It meets with the end of Notch, Inside Passage, and JP Cool, so there are also lots of options for the more advanced riders. It can be ridden in both directions. The total distance is about 3.5 km.\r\nJP Cool:\r\nIt starts at the 3rd cattle guard, i.e. where Cow Trail comes out.  A very fun twisty single track; intermediate technical level. At the end, you can take Sanchez back to the road, or Rock Garden back to the parking area. The total distance is about 3 km.\r\nSanchez:\r\nSanchez trail takes you to the end of JP Cool. A very fun, twisty single track through a burned area. It ends up on a road; go left and climb back up to the main road.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r",
    "directions": "In Merritt, at the junction Voght St. and Nicola Ave. (use the 7-eleven as a landmark), go south on Voght St , cross the bridge over Coldwater River. Turn left onto Mid Day Valley Road, which will turn into gravel at some point. You'll pass two cattle guards, and about 300m after the second one, you'll come to the meadows, where you park. There are trails going in several directions. You are there.\r",
