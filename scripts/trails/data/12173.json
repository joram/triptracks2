    "description": "While looking for some falls on the Prospect river near Halifax, I stumbled upon a very nice, well maintained trail.   The trail has been maintained in some spots with some pea size gravel and the branches on either sides have been recently cut.  However at some point the trail was veering off to where I wanted to head off.  I found a secondary trail which wasn't very well maintained and soon enough, I was literally swimming in evergreens.    I have seldom seen such a thick stand (maybe near White Brook falls in Earltown).   After a time spent cursing....I finally stepped out to see the rapids that I was hearing all the while.  the rapids are quite small but its scenic nonetheless.  I followed the stream and regained footing on a secondary trail which lead me to the main trail (which I was on in the first place).  Arghhhhh I didn't need to struggle through the evergreen stand...I only had to be patient and continue on the trail.   By now, I am wet and cold and hungry so I didn't continue on the main trail but it seems to go on for a while and it would be worth it to go back and explore.",
    "directions": "Prospect Rd, Turn on MacDonald Rd and park at the end where you will spot the gravel trail.",
