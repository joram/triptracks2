    "description": "This is a 2 vehicle hike as start and end points are six kilometers apart.  It starts at Andersen Cove with a pleasant meander through coastal rainforest over Babbington Hill.  Lots of twists and turns, no really challenging grades. It intersects with the Coast Trail which you follow past Cabin Point and end at Aylard Farm.  The book lists the Coast Trail as strenuous -- I would go with that rating.  There is a lot of up and down and climbing, crawling over rocks, etc.  It's a fabulous hike with jaw-dropping views.",
