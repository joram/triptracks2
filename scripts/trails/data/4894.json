    "description": "Bonnie and I put in at Hadley Point.  A great ramp and plenty of parking (keep the tide change in mind so you don't return to a submarine).  We paddled to Hull's Cove and back.  Most remarkable parts of the trip were the Ovens (holes in the large cliffs climbing from the water) at the halfway point and the seals that played with us at Hulls Cove.  We did this as a round trip but next time I will continue on to Bar Harbor and take the free bus back to my car (or vice-versa).",
    "directions": "After the bridge onto MDI take Rt. 3 to the East.  Hadley Point Rd. will be left after about 3 miles.  The road ends in the ramp.  The ramp in Bar Harbor is downtown near the junction of Main and West.",
