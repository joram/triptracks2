    "description": "This is a route of the 2013 winter trail (January) from the parking lot up to Keith Flavelle Hut.  It was done with AT gear and some pretty heavy packs.  At the time, the snow was pretty rotten so there was a lot of opportunities to punch through and fall into tree wells.  It was a bit of a slog but worth it once we got up to the top.Spent New Years with a bunch of great people up there and did some skiing up one of the legs of Joffre Peak.",
    "directions": "The trailhead is right off the highway.  The beginning of the route starts at the parking lot.  Just climb over the snowbank and through the trees.  You can't miss it!",
