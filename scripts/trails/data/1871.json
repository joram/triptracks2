    "description": "NTS Map: 082G01Distance: 8.8 km return. Elevation Gain: 350 m. Hiking Time: 3 to 3\u00bd hours return. Rating: Moderate.Forum Lake is a nice little alpine cirque which is generally a first leg in the  Akamina Ridge \r\nhike. But if you're on the way to  Wall Lake \r\n and want a brief diversion to a smaller lake, this will do just fine. Along the way, in fact just off the trail to Forum Lake and just after you leave the main trail, stop and visit Forum Falls (photo)(behind ranger cabin).Current conditions:\r\n\r",
    "directions": "From Waterton Visitor Centre, drive 0.3 km south toward the townsite on Park Entrance Road, and turn right (west) onto Akamina Parkway.
