    "description": "This is a adventure to a medium size falls near Peggys Cove.  I hd attempted this one a long time ago with my kids but the heavy brush made us turn back as the kids were smaller than the bushes!This time around, I scouted this place better and found an ATV trail almost all the way to the fall.   The trail is through a boggy area and is quite wet so beware.  Once the bog finished, I followed a game trail all the way to the stream and found a whopping one footer!Went upstream for a while and didn't find anything better.  I then attempted the downstream portion and right before I hit a lake, the terrain changed quickly and a series of fall finally formed.",
    "directions": "Highway 333.  Park at McGrawths Cove Rd.  Head along the ate trail on the opposite side of the rd (see gps track)",
