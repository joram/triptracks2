    "description": "The Sentier des Trotteurs is located between Victoriaville and Trottier Mills in the Bois Francs region of Quebec. The whole trail is a linear one that links Arthabaska to the town of Trottier Mills. It is about 25 km.Here I propose a shorter hike of about 8.5 km that include a loop to the top of a peak where you get a nice view of the region. The total elevation gain is 275 m and the hike is of moderate difficulty. Snowshoes are recommended when snow is present.",
    "directions": "The trail head is located next to the arena in the heart of the village of Trottier Mills.",
