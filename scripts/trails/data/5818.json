    "description": "The Ottawa-Nepean Greenbelt has some fantastic easy to average ski trails -- ungroomed except by other skier's tracks, they take you through some pretty pine forest and swamplands.  This particular ski leaves from the Moodie and West Hunt Club area (just a few hundred meters east of Moodie as you pass it if approaching from Bells Corners. \r\rThe terrain is flat, there are birdfeeders, a few small dips, but nothing to speak of.  Can be busy on weekends, but always a pleasant ski for an hour or two, or three if you cross the road and the loop on the other side of West Hunt Club.\r",
    "directions": "Get to Moodie and West Hunt Club.  Just a few hundred meters east of Moodie, you'll see P11 on a rise in the road.  Parking lot is easily identifiable.  One can approach from Bells Corners, from Richmond Rd take West Hunt Club, and, follow it past Moodie.  On the way, you'll pass other NCC P lots, so if you find yourself needing more, go explore. There are maps on the trail kiosks in each Parking lot, and a GPS may be handy if only to quickly figure out your loop or where you are relative to your starting point.",
