    "description": "A short hike just off the highway to  3 distinct falls.  What makes this hike great is that I passed by this brook a bunch of times without even thinking there could be a hidden oasis just passed the guard rail.  Jump over it and descend carefully the steep slope.  Immediately after the culvert there is a nice slide fall of about 15ft.  This is followed by a small five footer and then the last and biggest fall which is a two tier kind of a drop.  The stream then turn around on a 90 degree and exits the somewhat gorge you descended.  The place is great because it?s shaded in the height of the summer so you can cool down while taking pictures.",
    "directions": "Highway 4 out of St Peters towards Sydney.  After Chapel Hill, you cross the Soldier cove Rd and then go up a hill.  Park at the top of the hill approx. 45.69564,-60.736333.",
