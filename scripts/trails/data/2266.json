    "description": "Mostly downhill from the Parking Lot to Brown Cabin.  Good for snowshoe or back country skiing.",
    "directions": "From Parking Lot 15, follow the main trail into the bush.  About half a kilometer up, you will be turning right onto a Gatineau Park trail.  From here, you will eventually see the signs for Trail 57.  This trail will take you straight to Brown Cabin.  Then either retrace or follow along two lakes (Brown) on a return route that gives you a loop (see pics). Some minor route finding to find that trail at the end of the 2nd lake to crest the hills from where you initially came, and you'll easily make your way back down to the parking lot. Some interesting bluffs and foothills.  Great on a sunny day!",
