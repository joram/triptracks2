    "description": "This waterfall is actually quite close to the road and your best bet is to knock on some doors to gain access to their property and the valley behind the houses.   I wanted to see the fall but also to climb the big hill behind the houses to see the view of the harbour so I opted for a different route.From the gravel pit, I followed an atv trail to the edge of the woods.  I then traversed a small tibutary which had a nice 10ft fall.  Across, I saw the old atv path that shows up in my gps but instead of following it, I went  uphill.  and what an uphill it is!  At the top of the mtn I had a good but not great vantage point.  Good thing, I was there mostly for the fall.   I reached the fall by crossing an ATV path and then enetred a beautiful mature evergreen stand.  the fall drops about 30ft or so.  Again both Hugh Fletcher in the 1880s and Chris Sinclair beat me to this beauty of a fall!",
    "directions": "Highway 316 in Country Harbour.  The fall itself is at; N45.26581 W61.84866.",
