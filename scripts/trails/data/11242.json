    "description": "I set off in the valley of this stream looking for a large fall.  The valley itself is glorious with lots of large mature hardwoods.  The terrain near the stream is a lot less than glorious with lots of boulders and hidden crevasses between them.  not sure what kind of geology this valley has but it's a very good place to twist an ankle or worst.  After a minimum of effort you get to the series of falls.  The largest would be about 20ft with a lot more smaller ones immediately afterward for a total drop of at least 50ft.  To get back to the road, we headed up the side of the valley to the even ground above....it adds to the distance but makes for better walking.  Also the flat terrain on top is an old acadian forest type and is a sheer pleasure to walk through the giant ferns.",
    "directions": "Take Whycocomagh Mountain Rd to the top of the hill and continue towards  Lewis Mountain Rd.  The stream passes under the road.  Park at   46\u00b0 1.067'N,  61\u00b0 4.867'W and follow the stream down....",
