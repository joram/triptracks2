    "description": "This is an amazing hike. It gives you every thing that you want out of the rockies. The lakes are great. The views are amazing, and there are not that many people. There are also alot of options for day hike when you get there. You can also carry your trip on deeping into the rockies(we did, it was great). I'm not sure on the km of it, but it's worth while to keep following the path. (Ed. - 12km one way)In winter please check the local avalanche bulletins.",
    "directions": "Drive to Banff, from Banff go to sunshine ski resort. You need to buy a parking pass in Banff. From sunshine it's an easy trail to follow. There are numerous camp sites, which you have to register with the park board (the same place you buy your parking ticket.) Besides that, it's a well marked trail.",
