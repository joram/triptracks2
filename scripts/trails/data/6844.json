    "description": "This is a short walk along the banks of the Eagle River. It's not a great walk but it is in location that just might be convenient to get out of your vehicle and stretch a bit if you are taking a long drive on the Trans Canada Highway.",
    "directions": "Heading west from the Junction of Highway 1 and 97 in Sicamous it's the first right turn (right at a trailer park). Cross the tracks turn left and follow the road through the residential area to a parking lot where you will find the trail head.",
