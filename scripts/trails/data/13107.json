    "description": "Follow signage for Mt Tenerife waterfalls (this route is not on the map as the map does not show a route to the summit from the falls)Once you arrive at the falls, check out the falls they are pretty majestic and very tall. Right before the falls there is a steep route that winds up the ridge to the right and occasionally has some pretty easy scrambly bits with minimal exposure. After you hit the summit just hop on the regular trail which is pretty flat and long, there is also an option to add Mt Si to this loop very easily but we were running out of day light.",
    "directions": "Start at Mt Tenerife parking lot well marked on google maps.",
