    "description": "Nice little area to explore during the May 2021 lockdown in HRM.  This area is definitely well used by people but it was my first time there and I've lived in Dartmouth for almost 20 years.  A fellow mtn biker told me about it, Many tks!  The name stems from one of the entrance you might use to get in there.  At the end of road where you park is an ATV trail.  follow the main path or veer off on the smaller secondary paths to explore this area fully.  It has a mini bluff of about 35 ft on an angle, a large solitary- grafitti covered monolith in the middle of a cleared area and loads of paths going in all directions.",
    "directions": "Highway 207. Cole Harbour Rd going towards Lawrencetown.  turn on coleridge Crt and drive to its conclusion.",
