    "description": "An easy trail leads to an abandoned cold war bunker originally intended to house important documents should Canada be threatened.\nFrom the parking lot of the Heart Creek day use area take the path leading west. It's washed out a short way down the trail so make your way around it and carry on until you come to a marker post for the Trans Canada Trail. Take a left here and continue until you come to an intersection and another TCT marker, take the left path here as well. The trail gradually switchbacks from here to the entrance of the bunker. Bring a decent flashlight if you plan on exploring.",
    "directions": "The Heart Creek day use area is on the south side of the Trans Canada Highway across from Lac des Arcs. It is accessable by both east and west bound traffic.",
