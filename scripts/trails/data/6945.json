    "description": "The Tour de Calgary is a loop around the City of Calgary mostly on bike paths expect for a section the SW along 37th St SW.\nThis route was published in the Calgary Herald Outdoor activity section July 22, 2010.  There are a number of interesting places along the route to visit and see if you decided to deviate slightly from suggest path eating places can also be found. You could also do it in portions starting and and ended at different places.\nYou get city view in a couple of locations the most expansive views are in NW above Hanson Ranch. Forested sections in Fish Creek. I passed a deer very close to the trail that was in the least bit bothered by my stopping to take it's picture.",
    "directions": "Basically start anywhere along the route where you can access the path. My choice was 16th Ave NW at Nose Creek. Parking is available at any number of places, the Zoo, Inglewood Bird Sanctuary, Fish Creek, Glenmore reservoir, Edworthy park, Dalhousie LRT station, Beddington and Nose Creek to name a few. You could use the LRT to get from one segment to another.",
