    "description": "One of the nicest trails and a must do in the McBride area. Elevation gain: 4000ft to the alpine. \r\nThis 8km trail leads to an alpine ridge with spectacular views of the Cariboo Mountains as well as the Rocky Mountain Trench. \r\nThe first half of the route is over an old road with wet undergrowth (wear gaiters to keep dry). After 4km the road ends and a narrow trail continues to the alpine. At the saddle you can continue to the left to a large cairn on the summit. \r\n\r\n\r\nCurrent conditions:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r",
    "directions": "Drive 12km west on Mountainview Rd, which starts just 1km east of McBride. There is a very small parking spot to the right just after a small stream. A trail sign was there, or just some orange diamonds on the trees to follow up the road, with flagging on the trail higher up.\r\n\r\n[Advertisement]\r\nIn McBride stay at the comfortable cabins in a secluded spot above the Fraser river, minutes from the trails at Beaver Creek Lodge with fabulous views of all the surrounding peaks.",
