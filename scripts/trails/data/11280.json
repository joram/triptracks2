    "description": "This is a hike to a locally know waterfall and ravine set on the Glen Brook near West Gore, Nova Scotia.  The dirt road to get close to the fall is in pretty good shape in October 2013 but it could change as it is some kind of logging road.  Right now you follow some signage down an ATV trail to the side of Glen brook.  There is a large flat area by the side of the brook where it seems people will camp out from time to time.  Just downstream of this spot is the remnants of an old staircase leading down to the base of the 8ft waterfall.  The bottom piece is missing so in order to get to the base of the fall a scramble on  moss covered slate rocks is necessary.  The whole forest at the bottom of the ravine is old growth softwoods with towering pines and hemlocks.  It?s not the tallest fall I will ever give directions to but the combination of easy access and potential camping spot makes this a worthwhile destination.",
    "directions": "Highway 14.  Turn on Valley Rd in Rawdon gold mines and then turn left on Glenbrook Rd.  Continue straight at the four way intersection and park in the parking area to your left where there could be a small sign with fall on it.",
