Then cross over to Clinker Price col and up Mt Price and the summit cairn. Hard parts are the boulder field on the way to Clinker. And the scree on Clinker and Mt Price. Winter offers some relief from boulders and scree, however, avalanche training and precaution is necessary in any alpine environment in winter.",
    "directions": "Drive North on Highway 99 from Vancouver about 33 kms past Squamish. Watch for the signs along the road, and turn right toward the Rubble Creek parking area. The turnoff is just south of the Daisy Lake dam on Highway 99. It is about 100km from downtown Vancouver.\nFollow rubble creek trail to Garibaldi Lake Campsite continue past shelters and camping spots along lake. Till you get to battleship islands and the trailhead behind ranger boat launch and to the right. This is an unofficial trail and park rangers or park employees WILL NOT HELP YOU so don't ask them.  But the trail head has a cairn and flagging tape to the right when the lake is on your left side. Don't walk far from the rangers boat launch.",
