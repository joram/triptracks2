    "description": "Over the years I have visited a lot of waterfalls in the Cobequid Hills.  This is a description of one of the last one I had on my list to visit.  That being said, I still have some to visit but they are near or in Cape Chignecto Park.One of the cool things on this hike is actually driving to it.  From the TCH, I had often seen the 3  wind turbines  near Wentworth.  Well on the drive to the hike, you actually pass by all of them and what an impressive sight they are.  But I digress? Setting off from you care follow the old logging road and do it on the way back from the falls as well.  Don not attempt the straight line back like I did on the GPS track?big mistake it?s a very dense undergrowth and it doesn?t save you anytime at all.From the logging road, you should hear the first fall and cross the logged area which thankfully was done a short time ago so it?s easy to walk.  In the woodland near the stream, it?s just stunning.  The moss is a deep carpet but you have to be careful of the numerous deadfall since the area was logged right beside.  There are numerous small falls and rapids and two 10 footers.  I had marked these as 20 and 23ft??.not a chance unless I didn?t go downstream enough but I think these two falls might have become smaller over time as the data I used was from 1890?s.",
