    "description": "Mount Strachan through Christmas Gully - August 20 2016",
    "directions": "From the downhill ski parking lot, walk towards the Cypress Creek Lodge, staying to the right. Just beyond the lodge is Yew Lake and some signs pointing towards the nearby hiking trails. Follow the Yew Lake trail and watch for the well marked signs as you meander through the beautiful forest before reaching the first of several junctions.The route described here will be a clockwise loop from the Howe Sound Crest Trail and then returning via the Old Mount Strachan route and Baden Powell. The route is challenging at times due to a steep scramble up an area from the Howe Sound Crest Trail known as Christmas Gully.",
