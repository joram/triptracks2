    "description": "This is a cool little exploration I did in a part of the province often overlooked in terms of waterfalls.  The funny part is that I had previously explored a few brooks (Byers nearby) for waterfalls but managed to bypass the most scenic one; Curling Club Fall (Thanks to Lisa H for the local name).  As the name suggests, the start of this exploration is in the parking lot of the curling club.  I went to the back of the building and followed the brook upstream.  After 100m, I decided to go towards a clearing instead of following the brook.  after 300m or so I could hear the roar of the fall and found my way in a dense evergreen stand.  I lucked out and found a path that followed the ridge and then plunged into the ravine.  Its very steep here and a rope is in place.  Once down you are 10m from the fall.  Its a gorgeous three tier with a massive rock outcrop in the middle.",
