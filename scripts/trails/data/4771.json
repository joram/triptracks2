    "description": "One of the few legal, MTB trails in Banff National Park, this is a semi-popular trail running from the Canmore Nordic Center to the Banff golf course.  Rocky, rooty and uphill from East to West  (says our chief reporter N. S. Sherlock).  In Banff (HEY!!! You got in without paying the park fee w00tt!!11!) you can ride over to the Bow Falls, downtown, museums, Rose & Crown patio, you name it.  You can hang out at the river right beside the Banff Springs Hotel and smell the place up (assuming you rode hard and sat down wet) for the well-heeled guests.Can be combined with Goat Creek to make a loop (5km shuttle or bike ride down the dusty, narrow Smith Dorien road).  Can also be combined with the Canmore Nordic Center trails (I think you're expected to pay for that in Winter).",
    "directions": "Canmore Nordic Center, 'Nuff said, right?  Right??Oh, OK.... {sigh}, drive 90 km W of the Calgary Olympic Park to Canmore, follow the signs South through town to the Nordic Center.",
