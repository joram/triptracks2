    "description": "Another extremely popular hike in the San Diego area. Well defined path to one of the higher mountains in the area that may provide great views depending on the smog.Trail is rocky in some sections.If you go on a weekend expect it to be busy, probably hundreds of people.There are a couple of picnic tables at the top where you can stop and enjoy the view.",
    "directions": "East end of Poway Road where it intersects highway 67. Trail starts at gate at south end parking lot. It's a park and ride parking lot so it can be full at anytime.",
