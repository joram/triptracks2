    "description": "Up to Col and back.",
    "directions": "from Pemberton Portage Road, take Old Portage road and then take Birkenhead Lake FSR for 10 km, turn left after 2nd bridge and follow for Tenas North for another 7 km.There is no visible trail or trailhead but some orange and pink markers show two way to the Col. Look for small creek exactly where the GPX file starts/ends. The markers start on the right side of the creek. Be prepared for very steep climb through dense forest. the trail is barely visible in places but keep heading up. Once above the tree line, make your way through scree towards the small lake and the Col, from here there is great view of the Cerulean lake. You can continue to Sun God (on the right)  or Seven o Clock (on the left).",
