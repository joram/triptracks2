    "description": "This hike is right beside Hwy 97 and is very steep to begin (average 25 degree incline), but once you get above the tree line your efforts are rewarded with excellent 360 views of the surrounding mountains.  There are VHF relay transmitters at the very top if you don't mind a bit of scree.It's about 2-3 hours to get to the top, and 1-2 to get down, 11km all together..",
    "directions": "Heading approx. 195km north of Prince George on Hwy 97 the parking for this hike is on the left, about 14km past Powder King Ski Resort, just past Azouzetta Lake.",
