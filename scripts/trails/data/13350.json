    "description": "This is one which I don\u2019t know why I forgot to post.  Elederkin Brook has one nice fall located in a mature evergreen grove.  The walk to it is on an establish path and the forest is very open.  I would estimate the drop to be approximately 20ft.  there are a few smaller falls upstream of it on both of the branches.\n\nPark at the Kent store and follow the fence locate don the side of their lumber yard.  In the forest just to the side of the fence is a path.  Take it and follow the small brook.  At some point you enter the mature evergreen and keep following the brook downstream all the way to the fall.",
