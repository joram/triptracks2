    "description": "NTS Map:92F11.  From the trailhead, cross Paradise Meadows,keeping to the right at the first few trail intersections. You arrive at Lake Helen McKenzie after 3 easy km. Bear right, skirting the lake and climbing over a somewhat rooty and narrower trail to the meadows and Rangers' cabin at 6km. Just past this take the next two signed trails on the right heading past Hairtrigger Lake. The trail then descends to a junction above the head of Cruickshank Canyon. Turn right for a half km to the campsite at Circlet Lake. Distance to here is about 10.5 km.\r\n\r\nTo climb Mt Albert Edward, return to the last junction and turn right. You ascend a steep trail to a beautiful plateau. You then climb more steeply up to the ridge at about 11.5 km from the trailhead. Keep left where a route to Mt Jutland leads right.\r\n\r\nClimb the ridge, staying right at the junction with the route to Mts Frink and Castlecrag on your left. Climb the open ridge to the top after about 15.5 km from the trailhead.\r\n\r\nFrom Circlet Lake to the summit return takes perhaps 6 hrs including time to linger on the plateau, ridge and summit, despite the relatively short distance. It's also fairly tough going when there is snow still lingering. \r\n\r\nReturning to the trailhead on the same day is fairly easy unless you're beat.",
    "directions": "Take Strathcona Parkway from Highway 19 near Courtenay to Mt Washington. Turn left just before reaching the main ski area and park at the Paradise Meadows Trailhead. Distance from the highway is about 26 km",
