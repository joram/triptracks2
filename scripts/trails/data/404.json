    "description": "Deas Island Regional Park is a great place to practice canoeing in easy calm waters. Lots of bird wildlife: cranes, ducks, an eagle or two.\r\n\r\nIt?s good for those who might otherwise tire of False Creek, or attempting to learn in the ocean.  Deas Slough is a pleasant place on a sunny afternoon.  With so many marshy edges, the birds are everywhere and what better way to see them than by canoe.\r\n\r\nCanoe under Highway 99, and go a little further until you reach more open waters.  The entire outing is only 4 or 5 km; not too tough at all.\r\n\r\nThe only hazards are a few marinas along the way, but you also share space with a rowing club for part of it so there?s plenty of calm water.\r\n There is GPS data attached to this trail (see \"download GPS\"), which if loaded into your GPS can help you find route points.\r\nTo get there, take Highway 99 south from Vancouver, and just past the George Massey Tunnel, exit and proceed east on Marine Drive, 3 km or so until you reach Deas Island Regional Park.  Launch near the rowing club; there?s plenty of parking.\r",
