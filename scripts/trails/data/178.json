    "description": "There are 3 lakes to view on the Joffre Lakes circuit. This is a beautiful hike that is not too challenging especially with recent work. At the trailhead there is a large scale map of the area and the hike. Follow the Joffre Alpine Trail as you veer right past the first lake (lower Joffre Lake), and then follow the trail as you cross Joffre Creek and then start to climb. You will pass Middle lake on the right, Upper Joffre Lake on the left.  If you were to continue you would find yourself at the bottom of the Matier Glacier, which is spectacular.  You are rewarded with awesome views on most of your hike.  Great on a sunny afternoon - Sun, Ice, Rock, and lunch!Note: Be aware of the potential for icefall here. Some campers overnight in this area. Falling ice may have the potential to overrun the campsite.To get to the trail-head, when approaching Pemberton from Whistler (from the South), turn right at the T-junction, towards Mount Currie. In town, turn right again towards Duffey Lake and Lillooet, you will travel along a gravel road along the Lillooet River, crossing to the north side river just before Lillooet Lake.  The road climbs steeply (paved), follow this and continue  a short distance to the BC Parks Joffre Lake parking area, where the first picture below was taken (and waypoint #1 was marked). Details:Waypoint #1 is Parking & Trailhead, #2 is 1St Lake stream Junction and viewpoint of trail to Upper Joffre, #4 is base of rock fall scramble, #5 is 2nd Lake and Glacier view, #6 & #7 are viewpoints on s/w side of Lake looking at Glacier, #8 is s/w end of Lake, #9 is lunch spot on Rocks, the end!
