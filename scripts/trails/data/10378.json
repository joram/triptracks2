    "description": "Start with a short hike through the forest until  joining the fire road.  Continue for about 2.5 kilometers and the trail becomes more steep until you reach the ridge with a great view toward the Nakiska ski resort.  You can continue further from here but we opted to return the same way as the days in December are short.  The round trip is about 8 kilometers.  We repeated this hike many times over the past few years and on a couple of occasions we had to use our snowshoes in order to get through the deep snow.",
    "directions": "Take Highway 1 East from Calgary and turn south onto Highway 40 at the Kananaskis Interchange. The parking lot is 9.1 kilometers from the turn off on the East side of the road at the U of C field station.",
