    "description": "A serious workout.  600m from parking to summit.  There are several pretty rocky areas that require some pushing.  If going counter-clockwise, the first km is flat and the next 2.7km is a 17!! percent up grade.  If you're real good at rocks you may be able to ride it but most people pushed a substantial amount.  Next time I'd remember a map and see what the Ford Creek Trail looks like coming down, roads are boring.Going CW will give you a ride 5.5km up gravel, then some good riding ending with 3km of 17% down pretty much all on rocks & roots.NTS Map: 082J15Elevation Gain: 640 m (2,100 ft).",
    "directions": "South end of Calgary, go W on HiWay22 (turns into 66) past Bragg Creek turnoff, right to end (60km ish).  Park at right where pavement turns to gravel or at nearby recreation area.  To go CCW, at pavement/gravel point you will see trail going off straight N.  To go CW, take gravel road 5.5km, take trail to right.",
