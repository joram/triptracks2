    "description": "The trail is difficult because it goes on an old logging trail, so lots of boulders a large rocks to walk on. The road goes out to the end and then goes into the forest trail and to the cliff edge for a nice view, and back down again to the road fr the descent. Its a bit difficult to find the forest trail if you don't know what you're looking for, but the GPS outlines it very well.",
    "directions": "I park on the street before hiking up to the edge of the gold course and then taking the back way up to the trail. Park on the street before making your way to the waypoint start.",
