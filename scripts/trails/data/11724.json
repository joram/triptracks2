    "description": "The Wildside Trail offers a beautiful coastal hiking. The route follows the south west shore and gives views of small islands and the open pacific. When the tides are low, 90% of the hike is doable on beach. High tide is another matter, high tide routes take hikers through beautiful old growth forests. These diversions pass examples of culturally modified trees (CMTs).",
    "directions": "The Wildside Trail is located on Flores Island. It is accessible by boat. It is easy to catch a ride from the Tofino Government Dock. Many locals are willing to provide transport for about $25. Be sure to contact the trail administration, they will meet you on the other side and escort you to the office!",
