    "description": "Climb up from the parking lot at the Sprockids park to Sidewinder trail. Sidewinder cuts across the hill, crossing creeks and gradually gaining elevation. Follow signage on the trees to Highway 101. This cross-hill trail eventually comes out at a logging road. There are plenty of trails going onto or off of the logging road. We headed down the hill for a couple of KMs, and then jumped onto a trail called Charlie Brown. Charlie Brown leads into Pumpkin Patch, which eventually dumps on pavement. From there, you'll need to ride about 10KM on the road back to the drop-off point.",
    "directions": "Take the ferry to Gibsons. Ride / drive up the hill to the first T intersection you reach (Stewart Rd.) and turn right. Go ~200m up the hill and park in the gravel lot.",
