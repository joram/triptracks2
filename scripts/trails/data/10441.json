    "description": "One of the newest trails in the Moab area, the Intrepid Trail System including Great Pyramid and Big Chief loops is a pretty good trail.  Not that long (total 15km), and fairly easy (maybe 300-400m total cumulative climbing), but they do offer amazing vistas of the canyons below.  Think Wile E. Coyote.  There is a mix of slickrock, fine gravel and a bit of sand all nicely curving and cruising along with a bit of rock drops to overcome.  \r\rThe canyons below are part of Canyonlands National Park, a hugely expansive and remote national park that rivals Grand Canyon but better because it's empty.  You also get a bird's eye view of the evaporation ponds at Potash, UT, an industrial site owned by Intrepid Potash Inc. (who donated a hefty sum to the construction of this trail system).\r\rIt consists of three nested trails (one of IMBAs recommended trail building practices) of about 2km, 7km, and the full 15km Big Chief loop.\r\rPhenominal views about.  I can't stress enough the wild, fantastic scenery you will see here.  You are about 600m above the Colorado River and can see layers and layers of sedimentary rock depositied over the last 270 million (or 6,000) years.\r\rWhile in the park, also drive (or ideally, RIDE) the road South past the Visitors Center to the actual point of Dead Horse Point, a rock mesa connected to the rest of the park mesa by a 10m wide 'Neck'.  (Check it out on Google Earth)",
    "directions": "Dead Horse Point State Park is located near Moab, Utah.   Go 14km N on the hiway until you see hiway 313 on the left (West).  (Just N of the Bar-M trails and 200m South of the Shell / campground.)  Drive ~30km following the well signed, one left turn into DHP.\r\r($10 user fee).  Park in the lot near the visitors center, trailhead is signed at the opposite end of the lot from the VC.\r\rMake sure you go to Dead Horse, not Canyonlands *National* park which is on the same road.\r\rDead Horse Point State Park is located near Moab, Utah.
