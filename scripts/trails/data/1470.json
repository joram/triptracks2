    "description": "Elevation Gain: ~ 915 m (3,000 ft) The Sweetgrass Hills are situated in northern Montana, close to the Canadian border. A bit of a local anomoly, the 3 hills rise up from the surrounding prairie landscape like thry were transplanted from somewhere else. They are visible from 50-100 miles depending on the weather. But make no mistake, at over 7,000' in elevation, and a 3,000' climb, these are mountains more than 'hills'. \r\nThe trail generally follows an old road as far as it goes,then just head uphill. It gets a bit steep near the top, but the large rock 'scree' makes for good footing. The rounded top will not intimidate even the beginner, and the views of the surrounding prairies are endless. \r\n\r\nThe Sweetgrass Hills are sacred places to the plains Blackfoot natives. In the scrub trees surrounding the summit you may find prayer flags and pouches. These are sacred articles and should be left as you find them. \r\n\r\nTime and distance are out and back.",
    "directions": "From the Coutts, AB/Sweetgrass, MT. border crossing, take the 'Boundary Road' east towards the Sweetgrass Hills, following the road around the south edge of the hills. The trail we took was on private land, so permission must be obtained first. Actually, all of this land is private, now. So if you're in the area, drive out and ask for permission at any of the farms there. No guarantees.\r",
