    "description": "This is a combination of the trail around McConnell Lake and Sidewinder which is part of the Stake Lake trails. The trail around McConnell Lake by itself, is a very easy and pleasant hike for just about any level of hiker or age and a lot of organizations like Cadets, use the cabins on the left side of the lake for weekend events. The cabins are located up a short trail when you are about \u00bc of the way around the lake.",
    "directions": "The easiest and shortest route to McConnell Lake is via Lac Le Jeune Road via Iron Mask road. You will find the lake on the left about 1/2 hour up the road. This is also a Forest Service camping site.  The normal route is to go left at the lake. There are some nice places on the right, to stop and rest while enjoying the view. Continue around the left trail and about half way, you will see a trail that is marked with orange ribbons. Follow this trail up a short hike to the Sidewinder trail. Sidewinder is an old road and quite wide. Make sure you look at the entrance so you know where it is on your way back. There is a large tree with a line of rocks you can watch for on the way down.Sidewinder is part of the Stake Lake trail system and you can follow the road wide trail around to Stake Lake or turn off to Rossmoor Lake. For this hike I have gone to the summit and turned around. If you want to do the whole Sidewinder I would recommend doing it from Stake Lake. Once you are done at the summit, head back to McConnell and take the right turn down the trail. At the lake go left and follow the trail back to the parking area. There is only one trail around the lake and it is all forest.",
