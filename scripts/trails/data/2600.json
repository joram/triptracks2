    "description": "Hut Lake, once a 4x4 destination, is now a nice alternative to the crowds at Levette Lake.  The road is officially closed to motorized traffic but the odd bit of shattered rear view mirror and rusty winshield wipers keep the 4x4 legacy alive.  Some decent views of the Tantalus range can be had along the way.  The lake is smaller than Levette, but deep and clear, has views of Mt. Garibaldi, and features a somewhat aged floating raft that's good for swimming.",
    "directions": "Take Hwy. 99 N from Squamish.  Left at Alice Lake on Squamish Valley Rd.  Road forks right onto Paradise Valley Rd.  Left on Evans Lake Rd. (opposite N. Van Oudoor School).  Take the right branch just before the yellow gate at Evans Lake School.  At the large red gate you can park and walk up the road 2km to the trailhead, or keep on driving (4WD recommended) to a 2nd large red gate.  The Hut Lake trailhead begins at the gate on the right.",
