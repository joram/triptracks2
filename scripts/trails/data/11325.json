    "description": "Short hike to a locally known waterfall near Mulgrave, Nova Scotia.  Setting off from the woods road you can bushwack about 150m or if you have a good eye sight, spot the ATV trail on the side of the woods road and follow it.  The forest around here is a mixture of hardwood and softwoods with a couple of mature softwooods by tyhe gorge.  From the road, you will hear the waterfalls before you see them.  the stream here goes twists on two 90 degree truns in about 50m.  The geology is unique here.  The stream has carved out a deep channel leaving very square faces on either side of the stream.  At the bottom and on the opposite side you came from is a deep groove in the rock that almost...almost looks like an entrance to a cave.Easy spot to get to and abosultely a hidden gem close to the TCH on the way to Cape Breton.",
    "directions": "TCH to Aulds cove, turn right on highway 344  towards Mulgrave.   Drive through Mulgrave and turn right on Stora woods rd before you hit Pirates Harbour.  Drive up the hill and listen for the wasterfall on your left..or spot that ATV trail!",
