    "description": "You can barely hear the traffic in this nice cool park within Richmond.\nThe trails here are maintained by volunteers. And at the moment there is a short supply of them, meaning that the trails are fairly overgrown. Please note the the trail on the east side is especially overgrown and is not at all easy to navigate.",
    "directions": "Travelling south on Jacombs Rd there is an unimposing drive way just before Westminster Hwy. If coming from the south you can turn around on Smallwood PL (automall).\nAlternatively: follow No. 5 Road north and then take a left on Westminister Highway. then take your first right.",
