    "description": "This hike is 10 km each way--6 hours each way hiking; 2 hours each way biking.This beautiful trail leads to the head of the lake where huge cedar trees and a sandy beach await you. The trail starts out steep, but levels off and rolls gently up and down along the shoreline to Deer Point. At 8 km, take the Troy Creek Trail to get to the head of the lake, or descend to Deer Point camping area on the lake. At the end of the lake, you can go up another 10 km on Sander Creek Trail, or just enjoy the north end of the Lake, which is a gorgeous site in fall when red Kokanee fill the cedar-bordered creek.",
    "directions": "From the boat parking area of East Lake, drive before reaching the provincial campground at Texas Creek. Signs mark the trailhead at the rear of the parking area.",
