    "description": "Good leg stretcher on the side of the TCH.\u00a0\u00a0 Within a minute or two from leaving your car you will come up to this unexpected but beautiful waterfall.\u00a0 After the fence, follow the trail going downstream to the fall.\u00a0 The rock formation is also really cool with some small openings to explore.",
    "directions": "The fall is located on Waterlook Brook.\u00a0 Going north on the TCH, spot a guardrail 3.6km past the Kings Landing exit.\u00a0 Park after the gurardrail ends and find the opening in the deer fence.",
