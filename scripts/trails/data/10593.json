    "description": "The trailhead has water, bathrooms, etc. The trail starts off shared with other short walking trails and such, then quickly becomes a steep and rocky ascent, with some nice flowing singletrack downhill on the backside before coming back around. The climb is challenging with the steepness and rock gardens all along the path. Other linked trails are the Tom's Thumb trail and the Dixie Mine. You can also take routes all the way out to the McDowell Loop and competitive tracks.The climbs and rock gardens are challenging so depending upon your fitness level the ride could take anwhere from 1-3 hours.For bike rentals: We rented in Scottsdale (near Phoenix) at AOA-adventures for great weekly rates on GIANT and Specialized, allowing you to ride nearby McDowell Preserve or South Mountain.",
    "directions": "From North Phoenix, Take Bell Road east from AZ-101; go north on E. Thompson Peak Parkway; the entrance to the park will be a mile or so up the road on the right. \"McDowell Sonoran Preserve\"",
