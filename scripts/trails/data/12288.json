The mtn bike trails are a work in progress but right now there is a small terrain park to practice your jumps on.  On he road top the park, on the right hand side is American Hill. Aa small hill rich in gold mining history.  There are still lots of scree slopes of debris from the mines.  all the adits have been infilled or have collapsed.",
