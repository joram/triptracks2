    "description": "Old Caves Crater is trail is an easy (notwithstanding the mid-day sun) 2.3 mile return trip with a total elevation gain of 500 feet.  It's a well kept secret; truly an uncrowded local gem -- we encountered one person.  The trail meanders up the hillside at a steady incline.  The path is a fine, loose cinder; mid-ankle boots are a good choice, unless you like emptying rocks out of your shoes.  Poles would be useful.At the top you'll be treated to amazing vistas of the San Francisco Peaks, Mt. Elden and surrounding area.  There are also numerous shallow caves / lava pockets.The trail is almost totally exposed.  The heat and the altitude take it from easy to moderate.  There are a few forks in the path -- keep to the right ...although our unplanned detour was fun.",
