    "description": "The trail is located in the northern block of Prince Albert National Park, in Northern Saskatchewan.  Northern Saskatchewan, by the way, is very rugged Canadian shield that is all very different that the prairies most people think of in Southern Sask. \r\nThe trail rolls along the east side of Kingsmere Lake, passing through depressions in the dense boreal forest settings, and running along the lake itself.  The hike is moderate, with rolling hills and sandy beaches.  A backcountry pass is required, and can be obtained at the Parks Canada Admininstration Office in Waskesiu.\r\nThe hike is 20km long from the trailhead to the northend campground.  It says it takes 6 hours, but can be done in 4 with proper preparation.  Be sure to grab a map, to plan where you will be camping each night, since most of the campsites are reserved for groups!",
    "directions": "Located at the end of the Kingsmere Forest Service Road, north of the Waskesiu townsite, and approx. 2 hours north of Prince Albert, SK. \r\nFrom the parking lot, head down to the canoe launch.  From there you will see a sign that directs you to the trail.",
