    "description": "Nothing like a good title to catch people's attentions.  This is a very short hike to a beautiful hidden waterfall.  There is a trail to it so it is well known among locals but not many people from away know about it....until now.The trail starts by the side of the highway by an unassuming brook.  Walking in about 100m you come up to the river.  turn right and then the river has carved a deep ravine in solid rocks.  The water was high and cold so I had to climb up the right hand side bank and go down a very steep slope to the base of the fall.  At any other time you might just be able to ford the stream or come up from the left hand side maybe.The fall is a good 15-20ft drop and the rock walls everwhere makes i a special place...and now for the surprise.  turning back towards the highway i noticed a hole in the first rock wall (closest to highway) and it is by the side of the stream...you can't miss it.  I went down and looked and crawled in until I couldn't see anything anymore....it's an adit!",
    "directions": "highway 316 south to where Springfield Rd intersects the highway.  Polson's brook is jus to the south of that...there is a well defined pull-up area by some brush.",
