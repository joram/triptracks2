    "description": "This trail extends from Moose Ridge and continues along Raven Lake and over part of a steeper ridge system.  The trail then wanders north along the west shore of Echo Pond where grassy wetlands provide an ideal place for sighting wildlife.  Beaver, mink and the majestic moose are regular visitors to this area.  Echo Pond Trail connects to the much longer Hawk Ridge Trail.  Be sure to watch the trail signs so that you are not hiking onto the longer trail!",
