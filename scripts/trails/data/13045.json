    "description": "Hike in to see the Fernie Ammonite.  You need to cross the creek to start and the trailhead can be a challenge to find.  Most of the trail follows a draw, a bunch of slippery rocks with some flowing water depending on the season.",
    "directions": "Travel on Coal Creek Road heading out of Fernie, just past the gun range the trailhead is on the right hand side, you start by crossing the creek. Trailhead is not well marked, we spent a bunch of time looking for it.",
