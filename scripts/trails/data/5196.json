    "description": "A classic Calgary vantage point and Natural Park, though previously used to graze ungulates from the Zoo.  A small hill with about 30-35m of elevation and  a network of trails in the area.  There is also a large interpretive sign set on the top explaining the history of the hill.  (FYI: Tom Campbell never lived on it nor owned it.)\nOn the east side there are a could gravel paths and the remains of a jeep track under the power lines.  Easy to ride to from the inner city, great reason to get off the couch on a nice fall evening.\nAs we were there we stopped to chat with an older fellow we saw walking up and down the hill.  9 times he went up & down, not bad for a 79 year old, I hope I can do the same.",
    "directions": "The hill is basically on the NW corner of Memorial Drive and Deerfoot interchange.  Take memorial Drive W from the Deerfoot and exit to the right on the Zoo exit (St. George's Drive).  Follow St.G to the right as it curls around the hill and there are a number of free parking lots along that road.",
