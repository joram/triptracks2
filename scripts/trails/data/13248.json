    "description": "Lodge open only in the summer and winter20 to 45 minutesElevation gain insignificant of 15 m or so at average elevation of 1373 m*****We stopped by after a long 21 km scramble and wish to explore that area next time we go to Fernie. Nice views, several hikes and potentially a few scrambles on the northwest end of Lizard Range. Very nice little walk around the lake, that lodge is great and worth having lunch on their patio!",
