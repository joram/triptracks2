    "description": "I had spotted some good potential for waterfall at the upper reaches of Bass River of Five Islands.  The longest part of this hike is reaching the trailhead via car.  the road is in bad shape so you can't drive fast for the last 4km or so.  Setting off from a secondary logging road N45\u00b0 30' 17.3\" W64\u00b0 02' 47.1\", you make your way towards the river.   Near the river, the logging road opens up into a large clearcut.  I pushed through and found myself by the side of the river....A few rapids and some rock outcrops but nothing else.  I wondered if I should go up or downstream....I was correct this time!  I chose upstream and within a few bends passed the clearcut area was a beautiful 20ft waterfall (N45\u00b0 30' 40.9\" W64\u00b0 03' 13.3\") separated into two branches.",
