    "description": "This is a classic bushwack to a ravine where Matheson Brook plunges in a number of waterfalls.  The walk towards the ravine starts easy enough and once you hit the ravine there is only one spot where you have to literally climb on the side of the hill to circumnavigate a deep pool and high rock walls.  Unless you go there is the summer and just wade through that particular spot.  The bulk of the falls and the larger ones are all upstream of this point.  The major falls would be about 10-15ft and there are lots of smaller 3-5 ft everywhere as well as some really tall ephemeral streams on the side of the ravine after a big rainfall.At the end of the exploration you can get up the ravine and there is a logging road that will take you back to your starting point.",
    "directions": "Drive to Lornevale (Londonderry) on the mines bass river rd and the brook crosses a logging road at N45 28 13.3 W63 41 09.0 and the start of the majority of falls are at N45 28 35.1 W63 41 10.8",
