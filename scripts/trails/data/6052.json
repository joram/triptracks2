    "description": "This is shortened version of the full Prairie Creek/Powderface Loop and is a good after work ride.  A good workout and some sic downhills, meadows, and forests.  Beginning can be a bit of a rocky/rooty grind.  A beautiful ride in the fall but the leaves can be slippery.",
    "directions": "Park at the Powderface Trailhead and ride E along the highway about 0.2 km to Prairie Creek trail on your left.",
