    "description": "Easy sea kayak trail around the islands around the town of Stonington. Be weary of boat traffic. This is a \rcommercial port, these boys are hauling money. Fog can move in fairly rapidly, bring a GPS and have a \rcontingency plan if the weather turns. We found a great little island  that offered us a view on the shipping \rchannel and on the outer island. Parking at the dock was free but we were very polite in asking \rpermission. We made sure that all our gear was ready to go, prior to puting in.",
    "directions": "The put in was basically right in the centre of town corner of Seabreeze and Bayview Av. We parked and \rput in on the backside of the red building.",
