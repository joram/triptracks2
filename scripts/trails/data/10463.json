    "description": "A hike or snowshoe to the top of Isola peak. Bushwhacking required.\nDuring the winter the gates across the forestry road are locked. They open April 30th. If they are locked it will add a total of 6 kilometers to your round-trip.\nThe first portion of the hike is on an old oilfield road, approximately 3 km in one heads northwest into the trees for a bushwhack to the treeline, once out of the trees it's a straight shot up to the summit.",
    "directions": "From Longview head south on highway 22, head west on 532, then south on the Forestry Road Range Road 41a for 4 kilometers. If it's the winter season this is as far as you'll get as the winter gates will be closed until April 30th. Continue south on the road for 3 km's and then turn west. This should be your staging area. Two temporary bridges (locked gates) are in place across the creek (April 2012), but these will be removed once Husky finishes their reclamation work on an old wellsite. Thus once these have been removed a creek crossing will be required.",
