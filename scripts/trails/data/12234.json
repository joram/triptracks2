    "description": "This is a nice little exploration to an unknown waterfall a few minutes from highway 2 in upper Economy.   I had spotted a white spot on the satiate imagery in January and was bidding my time to go and visit once the water was flowing.  I went a bit early and the water was still frozen.  However the ravine has some really gnarly rocky exposure of some conglomerates.  Those and the fall makes this a nice hike...although a bit short but there is another ravine close by that I also visited and will post as upper economy fall.",
    "directions": "Highway 2 towards Economy.  turn on dirt road at approx N45 23 08.1 W63 51 34.7.  You can drive it up or walk...it's not very far......  The fall and cool rock formation are here;  N45 23 36.2 W63 51 32.4",
