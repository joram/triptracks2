    "description": "Park beside the road on Gaglardi Way. Bike up the Gaglardi Way, takes about 20min. There are two downhill sections. The first section is fairly easy going till you cross Burnaby Mnt Parkway. The second section starts directly across the road and becomes a bit more challenging. I ride this trail with my cross country bike (full suspension) and it is awesome. In winter there are some frozen puddles and snow can slow you down. In fall the leaves on the trail are very slick but still fun. Summer offers the least challenge. If this trail gets boring during the day then try it at night!",
    "directions": "Take Gaglardi Way off of the Lougheed Highway to SFU. At the base of the mountain just after the Broadway traffic light, around the corner there is a parking lane beside the road on the right where the trail begins (ends).",
