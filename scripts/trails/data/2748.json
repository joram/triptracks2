At the end the road becomes a dirt road called the Garibaldi Park Road.  Follow this along a few kilometres until a hiking trail crosses the road, with space for parking on the right.\r\n\r\nRide your bikes a few kilometres further up the road taking the second  forest service road (Ring Creek North FSR) on the left.
