    "description": "Trail is a little bit complicated if you never been there.  For the first time visit, you may want to print out trail paths from web page or grab my GPS trail paths.\r\rTrail goes along with the coast of lake Champlain and/or little hills.  There are several points where you can see Lake Champlains, islands, and NY Adirondacks side.  Trail is very easy to walk.  Many people brings dogs, kids as well.  The bicycle is not allowed to enter this Park.\r\rOn nice sunny weekend, you can spend 1-2 hours walk with fabulous lake views.",
    "directions": "From Burlington down town, drive Route 7 to South, take turn right on Queen City Pkwy.  It merges to Queen City Park Road soon.  Take left turn on Central Avenue.   At the right side of Central Avenue, there are parking lot.  About 10-15 cars can park over there.",
