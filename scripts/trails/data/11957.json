    "description": "This is a modified loop to the picturesque Kennedy Falls.  We wanted to avoid the Griffen (Bike) Trail as were certain there would be a lot of Mountain Bikers on a weekend.  The addition of the Headwaters Trail brings it up to a respectable 12 KM. From the Lynn Headwaters parking lot we took the Lynn Loop / Cedar Mills trail to a spur trail at about 2.5 KM  -- far side of a short boardwalk.  We crossed Lynn Creek just below the Big Cedar and on to the main trail to Kennedy Falls. Our return retraced back to the boardwalk on Cedar Mills Trail and left up to the Debris Chute where we returned via the Headwaters Trail to the parking lot.",
