    "description": "This beautiful trip has a combination of quiet easy going sections and small  to medium sets of rapids and finishes with the exciting Brierleys.  The most  difficult of the rapids are all easily avoidable by staying to the side there are a few sets that will be unavoidable but are generally only a level 1.",
    "directions": "From Red Deer take HWY 11 past Nordegg to Abraham Lake.  For a 2 day  trip start early from the Nordegg bridge.",
