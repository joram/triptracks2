    "description": "This is a very scenic ride that has good elevation changes, rocks, scenic lookouts and classic single track along the Niagara Escarpment.\r\rThere are a lot of trails here. You could easily spend the whole day here. The route shown is about 40kms but I have done some 70 km loops when linked with other trails in the area. The trails are marked and some are rocky and technical. Lots to challenge you!!\r\rWhen I rode this there was one trail closed because of flooding on the south end. The Bruce trail cuts through this area which you can follow to get to other areas. \r\rThere is a section of the escarpment that is used for rock climbing and a cool cave in the same area. For a cave description you can check this web link:\r\rhttp://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=d9e86aff-9fa6-4087-8e7e-bbd6271b4551",
    "directions": "There is parking on County Rd 2 about 15 km south of Thornbury on the east side of the road. The trails are on the west side of the road.",
