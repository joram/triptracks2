    "description": "This is another short hike to a multi tier waterfall only a few minutes walk from a highway.  You would never know there is a nice oasis here as where you start doesn't give any indication of a stream close by.  Of course I bushwacked my way to the fall to end up on an ATV trail close to the fall.  The ATV trail goes back all the way to the highway so no need to plow through anything on this hike.  The fall is set in a mixed, non mature, forest but with the path leading to it it's an easy walk to get to it.",
    "directions": "Highway 10 towards Sussex.  the fall is on Ryans Brook at 20 T 289108 5079409.  there is a guard rail on highway 10 and you should spot the ATV trail next to it.",
