    "description": "This is a really short hike to three waterfalls on the McLellans Brook and another fall on a a hidden tributary.  The upper falls are kind of small at about 5ft each but the lower fall is quite impressive at about 25ft.  the canopy is high overhead and mostly composed of evergreens.  If you jump across the large boulders downstream of the fall, you can enter a hidden valley where a tributary has carved a narrow gorge ...walk upstream for 50m and there is another fall.",
    "directions": "Highway 348 south to Churchville. turn on Brrok Rd and then right on Brookville Rd and park at 20 T 531681 5039864",
