    "description": "I was looking at some satellite imagery to find new bouldering opportunities.  A particular area intrigued me near Williams Lake.  Armed with my waypoints I got to the area where I thought I would start to bushwack.  Well this area is now the entrance to the new Shaw Wilderness Park.  there is a nice parking lot and a groomed trail for about 400 all the way to the lake.  after that its all \"real\" trails.  My gpx shows a lot of bushwacking to some of these bouldering features.",
    "directions": "Highway 253 to Purcells cove.  The parking lot is well signed and is located at N44\u00b0 37' 15.0\" W63\u00b0 34' 57.8\".",
