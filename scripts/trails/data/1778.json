    "description": "Take this trail about 1.7kms. It's a nice hike for a family but their are spots that come dangerously close to the ridge edge so beware).  There are two bluffs to stop at.  The first looks more east and over the river.  The second another 200m further one over looks south towards Poley Mountain.  Of the people I've recommended hikes to many consider this their all time fave.The first Bluff is at N 45\u00b0 41.994 W 065\u00b0 26.729 and the second is at N 45\u00b0 41.9874 W 065\u00b0 26.525",
    "directions": "Go to Sussex Corner using Main St. and take the Post Rd. You will pass the outdoor rink and cross a bridge. When you see a Power grid on the left at 1274 Post Rd. you will take a right onto Sullivan Dr. which turns into Pugsley St. which turns into Rodridge Dr. Follow this road to the end where you will find the big baby blue water tower. (You will pass a sign that says 'no trespassing beyond this point'. The locals say not to worry about this because everyone uses this access to the trails. I can attest to this personally because we met 3 groups of hikers and 3 groups of mountain bikers on this well used trail that starts at the water tower. I belief it just means don't mess with the tower - like we would want to :-> ) The trail head is at N45 42.441 W65 27.673 Park in the parking area beside the tower and walk around the tower until you come to a trail that follows the ridge.",
