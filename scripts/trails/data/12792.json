    "description": "A great trail running trip. The first half is easy, following the commonly used mountain biking trails of Lynn Canyon. The second half follows a not widely used trail to the top of Grouse. If you like Grouse Mountain but are tired of Grouse Grind, try this.",
    "directions": "Transit or drive to Deep Cove, where you start the usual Baden Powell trail.",
