    "description": "Not of the the tallest falls around but a nice stop to do at the end of a day exploring nearby waterfalls like Findlay or McCullough brook falls.  Red Station is the name of the road where you park, then just follow the brook as it comes down a hill and creates multiple gorgeous drops.  Only go after a rainfall though.",
    "directions": "Get to South Branch (Stewiacke River valley) and drive on Reid Station Road for 2.6km after turning on it from Meadowvale Rd.  The brook will be on your right at N45\u00b0 08' 40.5\" W63\u00b0 05' 35.5\"",
