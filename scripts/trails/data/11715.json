    "description": "A 2 km route that takes you to a high point of land overlooking Wellington Park and Danceland.",
    "directions": "Start at the community center located north of the Regional Campground and go in a clockwise direction.  After you leave the height of land head south down a eight degree incline.  This part of the trail is under development but I had no issue cycling down this hill. Just be careful.  You will eventually join track 1 at the south end.  Continue on your way and you will go by the pedestrian entrance to the Regional Campground. For campers this is also an ideal entry point.  I am rating this moderate, however for cyclists that are newcomers or not experienced some of this trail would be difficult.",
