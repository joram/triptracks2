    "description": "One of my first explorations for waterfalls that I completely forgot to add to trailpeak.  Acrss the St Marys River in Glenelg, rises some large hills and the two branches of the unnamed brook give rise to a few scenic waterfalls.  Setting off and following the brook is not fun at first as the area is overgrown and dense.  However, after just a few minutes you reach the foot of the hills and the forest finally gets more sparse.\nBoth of the branches of the brook contain falls.  The western branch also has a really cool straight rock wall towards its more upstream end.  Once at the top, traverse the forest and go downhill, the eastern branch to more falls (see gps track).",
    "directions": "Highway 7 towards Sherbrooke.  Turn right on highway 348.  Turn left on Waternish, cross the St Marys river and turn right on Lead Mines Rd which becomes Liscomb River Rd. At this point park and follow the brook on the right (see gps track).  Top most fall on east branch is at N45\u00b0 14' 57.0\" W62\u00b0 05' 13.4\"",
