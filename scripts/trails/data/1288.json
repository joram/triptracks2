    "description": "NTS Map: 082O04\nElevation Gain: 150 m  (220m from parking lot).   493m over 15 kilometers if you ride the whole loop (up road, up Upper, down the whole, schweet thing).\nGreat downhill run with some technical sections and some pretty fast spots too.  Good for all types of riders and capabilities.  \nUpper Stoney starts with a couple hundred meters of climbing up really rooty hiking trail, it can mostly be ridden though it's a grunt, averages 10% grade (easy on pavement, not easy on roots).  Upper Stoney downhill is very technical with rocky outcrops and all kinds of things that will do free dental work - that said I did it on a full XC bike with no significant problems.  \nLower Stoney downhill is much more flowy but still technical.  A good first run to get your groove on.\nNew GPS file as of June 2012 has the whole loop including road and the cut off to do just lower Stoney.\nNOTE: Upper and Lower Stoney Squaw are the only legal bike trails in the Mt. Norquay area.\nWinter: This makes a great snowshow from the entrance of the Norquay parking lot up a nice little trial to the Stoney Squaw peak.  A couple spots offer great views of the Bow valley though it is mostly through the trees. \n                  \t",
    "directions": "Follow the road up Mt. Norquay till you reach the big gravel parking lot at the base of the ski resort.  \nLower Stoney:  Ride past the chalet and past the first chair lift untill you see a small sign marking the trail on your right nearly at the second chair lift.  If you cross a bridge right away you're in the right place.\nUpper Stoney: Trailhead is just at entrance to parking lot from Norquay Road.  Look to the right as you come into the main parking lot for a little wooden bulletin board with a roof.",
