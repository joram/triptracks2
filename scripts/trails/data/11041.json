    "description": "This is an alternate way up Manuel Quimper that requires some scrambling during the last half.  It provides better views and variety from Harbourview Road, which is all in the woods.  There are lots of criss crossing trails in here, and there are some that will bring you over to Ragged Mtn.",
    "directions": "Take Sooke Rd west from Victoria, turn right on Harbourview Rd, and park at end of road in park parking lot.  When you enter the park you will have Harbourview Road trail on left, and another more overgrown trail on the right (old logging road).  Take the trail to the right.",
