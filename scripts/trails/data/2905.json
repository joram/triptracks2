    "description": "NTS map 082N01/02\n  Boom Lake is a classic Banff cross country ski outing. \n The trail gently ascends from the highway to the lake. It is a fast and fun ride back with gravity doing half of the work. \n This is a popular trail so careful not to run anyone over on the way down!\nThere has been a slight re-route of the trail to go through the forest rather than across the tail end of an avalanche run. I didn't see anything on the entire trail that would make me the slightest bit worried unless we had a brazillion feet of snow some year.\nIn winter please check the Avaluator(Online Trip Planner) rating is:  Challenging.  See more trip planner route details here.",
    "directions": "There is a parking area at the trailhead, located on the Radium Springs highway 6 kms west of Castle junction.",
