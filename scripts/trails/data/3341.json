    "description": "This is a variation of Mount Maguire trail. \r\n\r\nThis is a loop starting with the hike to Mount Maguire then following Copper Mine Road to the Coastal trail, and the coastal trail to either the junction with Pike Road or the trail parallel to Pike Rd. (GPS data is for parallel trail).\r\n\r\nUpon descent from Mt Maguire, head east to intersection with Copper Mine Road, (it's not a road any more). Then take Copper Mine Road to Coastal trail, follow coastal trail to intersection of either Pike Road or trail east of Pike Road that parallels Pike Road. We did the parallel trail and found it somewhat difficult, Pike Road might be easier.\r\n\r\nThis provides views from Mt Maguire as well as a short walk along small section of the coastal trail.\r\n\r\nCoastal section of trail is difficult.",
    "directions": "Old Island Highway to Sooke Road. Follow Sooke Road (#14) towards Sooke, to Gillespie Road, turn left and continue down Gillespie Road. Turn Right on East Sooke Road, and follow it Pike Road parking area.",
