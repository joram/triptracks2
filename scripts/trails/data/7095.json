    "description": "What makes this trip special is the excitement of crossing currents, the adventure of exploring islands, the beauty of the little island beaches, the variety of hiking coastal trails, and last but not least the excitement of having a gray whale breach next to your kayak.\n Time this trip so that  you don't get too much current from tides -- the water short crossing can be quite rough.  I would not advise using a canoe.  \n From the beach at the end of 10 mile point, kayak to Chatham Islands.   The route I chose was driving by a dominate ebb tide.  I chose to paddle down between the two islands, landing at various beaches as I saw them.  The route also includes crossing one of the islands to explore an inlet.  The route continues on around discovery island, past the lighthouse and lands at a campsite.  From there there is an easy and beautiful trail to the point.  On the way back I saw whale watching tour boats gather -- and I knew what that ment; a gray whale feeding along a kelp bed.  It was repeating its swimming pattern so I could easily predict where it would come up for pictures.",
    "directions": "Drive to 10mile point, take Tudor road to the beach access when the road makes a sharp bend.",
