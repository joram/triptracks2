    "description": "I was lucky enough to fly over the eastern shore of NS in the fall of 2018.  From the air, I spotted what looked like a waterfall to the northwest of Sheet Harbour.  After looking at some maps and imagery, I narrowed down the list of places where this occurrence was hidden.  There are not a lot of falls on the eastern shore so finding a new one is usually hard!A logging road takes you to within a few hundred metres.  The road is passable as of spring 2019.  Walking on an overgrown secondary logging road, you reach a wide logged area.  Push through the woods to the stream and head upstream.  Within a few minutes of effort, you will reach the waterfalls.  It?s the eastern shore so don?t expect a whopping dropper.  The stream here is separated by a huge rocky island so you get two different waterfalls.  One on each side of the island.  Drops are about 6ft in height but still very scenic",
    "directions": "Highway 224 north from sheet Harbour.  Turn on logging road on the left at; N44.94271\u00b0 W62.59181\u00b0.  continue on it until a large wooden bridge at N44.92869\u00b0 W62.63859\u00b0.  Immediately after bridge turn right and continue until you see a secondary logging road on your right.  Hike to the falls approximately at; N44.93231\u00b0 W62.64867\u00b0",
