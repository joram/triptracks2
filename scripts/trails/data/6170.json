    "description": "Centennial Park offers many things to the city residents of Moncton. Off the gravel paths are nice single track paths plus a nice bit of work with ramps, jumps and berms.  Nice bit of urban fun when you want a short workout in the city.\nI'm not sure how long the circuit of trails goes, but It's a bit of a taste of mtn bking while enjoying a great city park.",
    "directions": "From the parking lot off of St. Georges Blvd. and to the left of Centennial Park Road.",
