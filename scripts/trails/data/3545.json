    "description": "Dead Moped is a mountain biking trail on the lower eastern slopes of Burnaby Mountain, below Simon Fraser University.  It is a moderate trail with a few more technical options such as skinnies, log rides and ramps, but there are alternate easier routes past all of these.\nDead Moped is the natural continuation of North Road Trail.  At the northern end of North Road Trail, turn right, and follow the trail on your left until you see it duck back into the trees.  This trail has two main sections.  A left hand trail linking up to the Trans Canada trail divides the two sections.\nThis is a fun trail, a good one to cut your teeth on, and makes a great addition to the North Rd, Trans Canada, Mels, Nicoles loop.",
    "directions": "Off Gagliardi way, turn into Broadway, then go let at North Road. Shortly after the park lands start on your left, and up a steep hill, you will see a place to park your car on the left. A notice board with a map can be found a short way down the main trail (Pipeline Trail). North Road trail starts here on your right.  Follow this through until you get to Dead Moped.",
