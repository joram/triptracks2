    "description": "Here is a hike to some potential falls I had spotted on satellite imagery.  Rockland Brook has some major falls near Londonderry already described n trailpeak.  The following falls are located way upstream in an area seldom explored.The easiest is to park where I describe below and the follow the river upstream to 5 different sets of waterfalls.  None of these falls are very high wth tallest at about 12ft. but they are pretty scenic and the terrain to them is actually not very steep for this area of the province.Main fall areas are at; 1- N45 31 35.0 W63 36 04.82- N45 31 49.5 W63 36 03.23- N45 32 03.9 W63 36 06.44- N45 32 47.4 W63 36 37.95- N45 32 30.0 W63 36 09.abthe best one to see would be number 3 above has it has 3 drops close to each other.  These can be seen on sat imagery and they seem taller.",
    "directions": "Highway 4 towards Wentworth Valley.  turn on logging road at; N45 30 03.1 W63 32 12.7.  Continue until you can turn on secondary logging road at; N45 31 23.0 W63 35 16.1.  Go down the hill and park where your gps points towards the falls.",
