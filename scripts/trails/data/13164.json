    "description": "This is an area of Cape Breton not well known for its waterfalls.  But if you explore enough, you are bound to find one.  That's what happenned to me in the spring of 2019.  This little stream has no indication of anyhtng special.  There is actually a farm over the whole thing by the side of the highway.  I opted to get into the woods and bushwack instead of following it upstream from the highway and therefore not stepping on someone's property.   You could always knowck on the door and seek permission to follow the stream too.",
    "directions": "Highway 105.  Turn on Riverside Dr going towards Princeville.  Drive about 4.5km to the brook that exits between the two farm biulding.  Drive ahead just a bit to the bridge.  Get into the woods there and bushwack to the fall at     45.75751, -61.28292.",
