    "description": "The Acadian Trail is the first trail upon entering The Cape Breton Highlands National Park from the Cheticamp Gulf Coast side of the island.  It is a moderate to difficult trail(depending on which direction you go) up 365m to a great lookout over the Gulf of St Lawrence and Cheticamp below.Climb the 365 metres above the Ch\u00e9ticamp River for panoramic views of the Acadian coastline, the Ch\u00e9ticamp river valley and the park's highland interior. Benches along the way let you rest periodically and enjoy the scenery. Watch how the forest changes as you climb steadily to the top and be on the look-out for black bear and moose.It is mainly a day hike trail with no overnight locations.",
    "directions": "Travel NE out of Cheticamp to the Vistors Center at the park entrance.  The trail begins right there. Enjoy",
