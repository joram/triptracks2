    "description": "Hike the Elora Gorge above and at river side starting from downtown Elora. This is a loop trail and requires you to cross the river at a certain point. If river flows are very high, you will not be able to cross and have to turn back. Approx 10KM, it winds through the Elora campground hugging the fence. A staircase leads down to the entrance where people tube on the river which makes a great lunch spot. Another stone staircase earlier in the hike allows you to explore a bit of the gorge at river level.",
    "directions": "The trail ends at the parking lot before the river in downtown Elora. This can be used as trail head or end if you follow the GPS data track.",
