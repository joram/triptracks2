    "description": "Here is a hike on a little known brook that will eventually take you to a breathtaking fall in the middle of nowhere.   Setting off from the well maintained gravel road, the walking was easy until I reached the lip of the ravine where the evergreen were putting up a formidable barrier.  After cursing and tripping a lot i made it out and down to the stream...It's really small and almost out of water in early June!I wasn't sure if the falls I was looking for were down or up...I decided to go up and found a couple of nice small drops....then I walked another 600m with very little to show.....then in the distance a cabin!  I went around it and wouldn't you know it a spectacular fall was just upstream of it.  It is about 30 ft and leaves the rock wall for a true drop!When there is more water, I will go more upstream as the terrain looks good for another fall!",
