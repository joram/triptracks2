    "description": "A very nice walk that starts up an abandoned logging road and quickly leads into a thick forest (about 15 minutes of moderate uphill). You will cross the river on a footbridge. There is a bench at the top of the hill where you can sit down and enjoy a view of the valley. On the way down you will arrive at Warspite Lake with cool towering rock walls. Interpretive bruchures can be found at the trailhead.NTS Map: 082J11Elevation Gain: 70 m (230 ft).",
