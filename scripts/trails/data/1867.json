    "description": "There are about 5 diferent loops to choose from.  You can combine any number of them to make a ride as long or as short as you like.  Most of the trails are good hard packed single track.  There are some sandy sections that will get your legs pumping, but these are usually short and don't pose too big a challenge.  A lot of short ascents and descents.  Almost entirely under the canopy of the Sandilands Forest.  Can be some water in the odd creek running through the trails.  In dryer weather these are easily rideable.  Trails are VERY well marked.  Bring bug spray and a lunch.  Enjoy.",
    "directions": "From Winnipeg, head south on HWY #59 to the junction of HWY#52.  Head east on HWY#52 and continue on past Steinbach.  This road eventually turns into PR #210.  Continue on this HWY past Marchand.  You will eventually get to Sandilands Provincial Forest.  You can park in the parking lot located near the Ranger office.  Most trails loop from there.  See attached jpeg to this trail.",
