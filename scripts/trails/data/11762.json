    "description": "One of many, many trails in the Superstition Mountains. This one is steep, but the trail itself is not difficult. The trail continues through Fremont Saddle, but we stopped there for lunch and then went off trail to explore the caves in the cliffs to the east (and got lost). Beautiful views of the surrounding mountains and of course all the cacti. Once you reach Fremont Saddle you have a great view of the stunning weaver's needle. There is a trail along the ridge top to the right, out to the lone pine tree. There is a cache at the tree with a logbook and some emergency snacks and band-aids.From Fremont Saddle you can also connect with Bluff Springs Trail and return to the trail-head that way instead if you wish. Be careful of wandering off the main trails. There are lots of small trails that lead nowhere, it is easy to end up on top of a cliff with no way down.The trail-head parking lot is the starting point for several trails. There are washrooms, a large map and a sign-in/sign-out book. Many people are rescued off this mountain every year, often having to spend the night before being evacuated. Go prepared with plenty of water, appropriate clothing etc. Like all hikes in the desert, stay on the trail and don't touch the cacti!For guided hiking and biking trips in Arizona, check out aoa-adventures.com.",
    "directions": "From Phoenix or Apache Junction, head East on the 60. Turn left onto East Peralta Road. This road turns into a dirt road after passing through a small community. Continue to the trail-head.",
