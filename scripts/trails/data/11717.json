    "description": "Belize, Unbelizable. Warm water, coral reef, tropical fish, exotic food, kayaking and snorkeling;  the best vacation a kayaker can think about.When Michel and Martine asked us if we were willing to go on a kayak trip to Belize with them this winter, we had a hesitation: a two week trip in Belize at the end of April when we had just come back from Mexico in mid-March! We asked for few days to consult ourselves prior to confirming. Thankfully we said Yes.  The first week would be a kayak tour on the coral reef, and the second week would be an inland tour to see the Mayan ruins and caves in western Belize and Guatemala.We really enjoyed it. What a change compared to the dark freezing water of Northern Quebec, which I also love, but in a different way.Wilderness Adventure provided a well organized and safe trip. Special thanks to Karm, the guide.See attached picture and the kayak trail.",
