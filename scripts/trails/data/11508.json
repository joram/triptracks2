    "description": "This hike takes you to a magnificent waterfall at the end of a gorge near Loch Lomond, Cape Breton Island.   Setting off, I followed the mostly dry brook until I bee-lined through the somewhat mature deciduous forest.  After a few minutes, you emerge under some power lines.  Descend the hill near the power line where the brook emerges.  Then follow the stream up and towards the fall.  The side hills become steeper and steeper until a point where you won?t be able to descend to the stream edge so your best bet is to just follow the stream the whole way.  Just before the main fall, there is a huge boulder with ferns on it and some small cascades right beside it?you are then very close, a sharp bend of the stream and at the end of the mini gorge lies the 50 footer.  On the return trip I followed the stream the whole way as it was pretty dry at this time of the year and exited through a fallow field and back to the dirt road.",
    "directions": "Highway 4 towards Sydney.  Turn on Hay Cove Rd and continue on it until it becomes Salem Rd.  The brook with the fall crosses the road at 45.816328,-60.566441",
