    "description": "This trail starts at the Woodfibre Mill. 2/3 is a logging road, followed by a fairly steep and, after an initial smooth trail (just after the bridge) rough trail up to the lake, and cabin.\r\n\r\nUntil recently, you could access it by way of a free ferry (passenger only) from Darrel Bay (just across Hway 99 from Shannon Falls), but with the closure of the mill, this ferry will probably be discontinued soon and you'll have to cross Howe Sound by your own means. You can phone the shipping department at WFP at (604) 665-6200 to check and for schedules.\r\n\r\nThere is a geocache at Henriette Lake. For more info and photos on the trail and details on the geocache, see http://www.geocaching.com/ and search for the \"Woodfibre Cabin\" cache.\r\n\r\nBEWARE, THIS IS BEAR COUNTRY!",
    "directions": "Assuming you can take the ferry, drive up Hway 99 to Darrel Bay, just across from Shannon Falls. Turn left at the lights. Make sure you park only in the upper parking lot, available for non-staff. Otherwise, You'll have to boat or canoe from elsewhere.",
