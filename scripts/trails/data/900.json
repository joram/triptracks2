    "description": "Lighthouse Park in West Vancouver is a great place to spend a day exploring the history of the park and enjoying the magnificent views from several points of land.  This report supplements my other post of the eastern trails.For a park not that large it provides many hiking opportunities and is accessible year round.  Pick up a map of the trails at the entrance kiosk.  The western trails are better maintained and marked than the eastern ones.Described here is the route I took on a recent visit to the park.  Starting from the entrance area take the Juniper loop.  If short of time, follow it to the Shore Point Trail and the views from a viewpoint then proceed to West Beach where you will get some great views of the Point Atkinson Lighthouse.  Spend some time exploring the historic old buildings before returning via the main Beacon Lane or Valley trail.",
    "directions": "Follow Marine Drive west towards Horseshoe Bay and when just past Caulfield, you should see a sign on the left side of the road.  Turn left and drive a short distance to the parking lot--the trail starts by the entrance to the parking lot.",
