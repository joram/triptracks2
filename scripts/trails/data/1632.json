    "description": "This trail parallels a river in the region, and was developed by the community as as off shoot of the Scales Pond recreational park.\r\n\r\nIt starts off as a posh wood chip covered trail that after a Km or so, goes back to an honest foot path. Occasionally there are benches, and signage interpretting the flora and a bit of the river's history.\r\n\r\nThis is a nice afternoon hike, and potentially a quassi back country camping adventure of you wanted your kids to taste a bit of the sub wilderness. I would bring your own water however due to the potential farm field  contaminants draining into the water.",
    "directions": "From Summerside, take the 107, until you reach the 109. Turn right, and look for Scales Pond signage.\r",
