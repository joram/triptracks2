    "description": "To climb 2nd tallest mountain in Colorado: Trail starts through nice forest. Gets rocky. Awesome wildflowers (in July) about 2/3 of way up. Couple people near the summit. May find Rangers present.",
    "directions": "To get there, head south from downtown Leadville about 4 miles. On your right you will see Hwy. 300 and possibly a sign for Halfmoon Campground. Take Hwy. 300 eight-tenths of a mile then turn left on FR 110. This road will take you the additional six-and-a-half miles back and up in the valley between the aforementioned mountains. You'll pass the Halfmoon campground at about mile five, however the trailhead to Massive is a little bit further down the road.",
