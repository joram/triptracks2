    "description": "One of my favorite walks I did it 4 times this season. Well benched trail the whole way thanks to Summit Trail makers Society 2018 track rework. No water. Follows basin to the skyline pass then follows ridge and swtiches back up avalachne slopes on well marked path. Last 100m is on somewhat benched scree slope. When hitting summit ridge most parties will traverse a steep ridge to the true summit about 10m higher. About 4-5 hours return. Popular with locals, as much higher than Mt Swansea and fabulous views towards Assinaboine, Mt Nelson.",
    "directions": "Drive past Swansea Mtn on the WestRock mine road. Turn left up steep switchbacking road before the Twin Lakes. See GPS image attached of the drive. Regular car can get up here fine.",
