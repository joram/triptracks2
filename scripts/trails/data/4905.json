    "description": "Bonnie and I put in at NE Harbor.  Tons of parking and an all tide ramp.  Our original plan was to explore the islands to the South but as we approached Bear Island the seas were too big so we headed West to use the coast as shelter.  We went up into the mouth of the Sound and crossed over to the other side.  We made our way to SW Harbor, then headed back East using Greening Island for shelter.  Next time I will do a better job of knowing the sea and wind and tide situation before starting out.  It all looks calm in a protected cove like NE Harbor but only 1/4 mile out the world is quite different.  Next time I'm in the area I think I'll let the tide decide which way I explore the Sound from top to bottom.  That looks like a promising paddle.",
    "directions": "If you are on MDI, both harbors are easy to find and are well marked on any map you find.",
