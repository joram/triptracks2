    "directions": "Park at Skyline trail in the CBHNP, the trail starts across the road. You may want to park a second vehicle at the Cap Rouge lookoff as that is where it finishes. You walk on top of French Mountain and cross over to Blueberry Mtn where you'll get stunning views of the Cabot Trail.",
