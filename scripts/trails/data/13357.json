    "description": "A shorty but a goody.  What to do when you are stuck roaming around your home base...... explore!   I have lived in Dartmouth for over 15 years now and have driven by these cliffs countless times.  The kids and I decided it was a good time to get out there and try to see if there was a path to the top.,  Spoiler alert; there is!\n\n\nOk so not much of a path at times but a scramble but loads of unofficial trails to lead you from the lakeside to the top of the cliffs.  The bonus is the two seats bolted on top of the rock with the best view in all of Dartmouth.  The only drawback is the amount of garbage around...pack it in, pack it out!",
    "directions": "Waverley Road, driving towards Nine Locks from downtown Dartmouth.  Turn right on Maple ave.  At the end of Maple, turn left on Plymouth.  Drive to the end of Plymouth where Mountain Rd is located on your right.  Park well away from the mailboxes.  The trail is at the end of Plymouth on the left.",
