    "description": "This is a combination place. there is a part of the cobequid multi-use trail as well as 4 loops of Mtn biking trails.   Some of the loops are super fast as they put some crushed stone.   The only drawback is that there might be hikers on the mtn bike trail although there are signs that prohibits this.  They are no long trails but fun and fast nonetheless with very minimal roots.",
    "directions": "College Rd in bible hill.  Turn on Warren Dr and park at the end.",
