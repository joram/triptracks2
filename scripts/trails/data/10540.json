    "description": "Short cut up to the Twin Lions.  Trail runs through steep and tree cover canopy.  Fallen trees and boulders occupy the upper tail.  After a sudden break in the tree line the trail leads you to the top of a giant rock over looking howe sound on one side and the Lions on the other.  Truly impressive standing at the base of these giants! If you're quiet enough you can hear rocks falling off every minute or so. Sad to think that these beauties are fallen apart and shrinking more and more each day but none the less still beautiful.",
    "directions": "Take Hwy 1 to Lions Bay. exit @ Oceanview Roadleft on Cross Creek Roadright on Centre Roadleft on Bayview Roadleft on Mountain Drive left on Sunset Drive. Parking is always full so prepare to park down the road somewhere in the neighborhood.  I suggest dropping everything off at the trail head and then finding parking.  Hiking up the cement road with a big heavy pack is tough on the knees and you'll need that energy to survive the steep trail up.",
