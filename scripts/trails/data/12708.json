    "description": "From Fight Meadow in Wells Gray Park, head north over 52 Ridge, down Bull Valley, and from there, it`s 400+ metres up to the lower summit of Battle Mountain. There is an old fire lookout cabin on lower summit, it was snow bound on March 28, 2017 when we were there, so no possibility of lunching in there.In winter, make sure you have avalanche equipment, beacon, probe and shovel, and check the avalanche conditions.",
