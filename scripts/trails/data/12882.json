    "description": "This is a moderate hike to a spectacular falls near Egypt falls on Cape Breton Island. The start of the hike is unfortunately though some logged areas.  the area is overcrowded by prickly bushes .  After about 400m, you finally enter a hardwood forest.  there was some selective logging in that area but the walking is much easier.  Find the head of the ravine and hike down.  Approach the fall further downstream because there are some high cliffs surrounding both sides of the waterfall location.  the slope of the ravine is full of large deciduous trees.  The fall is a picture prefect single drop of about 40ft with a pool at its base.",
