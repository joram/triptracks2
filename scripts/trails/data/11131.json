    "description": "This is not a long hike but a good place to stretch your legs, go for  pic-nic or a nice refreshing swim when you are travelling the Western Quebec, Eastern Ontario region.The hike is set in a typical Western Quebec hardwood forest and watch out for some poison ivy along the river's edge.  The trail is short but affords some really good views of the magnificent Chutes du Moulin which are a good 50 foot high or more.  The fall are quite high and carry a lot of water  DO NOT SWIM UPSTREAM AS THE CURRENT COULD CARRY YOU DOWN QUITE EASILY",
    "directions": "Highway 50.  Montee Papineau exit.  Turn right on Chemin Malo and park at the bridge over Nation river.",
