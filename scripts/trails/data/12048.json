    "description": "Edwards Rating: II (IV) S M Elevation of 719 m NET, 916 m TOT & max 2732 m4 to 7 hoursYOU HAVE TO RESERVE YOUR PLACE ON THE BUS TO LAKE O?HARA MONTHS IN ADVANCE (1-877-737-3783). OTHERWISE, YOU WILL HAVE TO HIKE 12 KM BEFORE EVEN START YOUR SCRAMBLE.This is a stunning and short scramble: incredible walk up and down official trails/ledges, nice and challenging scrambling under and around the summit block/pinnacles, wonderful views of Mt Huber-Lefroy-Yukness and Glacier Peak & short distance for an easy and fun day.Starting from Le Relais Day Shelter, cross the road and go to the Lake O?Hara trail and then turn left. Walk a few metres to reach the first sign for Wiwaxy Gap/Huber Ledges trail. Hike up this trail to Wiwaxy Gap. From the col, turn left to reach the base of Wiwaxy East Peak that you can see from there. As soon as you get to its base, follow the cairns to eventually get to a short and moderately exposed ledge. If you can?t make it, lose some elevation and come back up from the scree gully. The rock is solid though and it is a 2-3 steps ledge. Then keep going up and left to reach a wall, you will walk along this cliff through two gullies and see a cairn not so far away. This leads you to the back of the peak, where you will sideslope for a few metres and look for a gully to your right. There starts some great hands-on scramble straight up and then right to another ledge. You will see a weakness in the rock band on your left (there?s a piton there, but it is good rock for scrambling). Once up that band, you will have to go back down a bit and cross another ledge that leads you to the last portion of this awesome scramble, where you can either climb on solid rock or hike up a tiny scree gully located slightly on your right.We have completed that scramble on wet rocks in snowy conditions with sometimes reduced visibility. We used to be unable to do that kind of scramble in bad conditions. It certainly adds up to the challenge and I recommend you complete that scramble in dry conditions. Because of the route finding, hands-on scrambling and ledges on the summit block, I would consider this as a difficult scramble.",
    "directions": "From Lake Louise, continue onto Trans-Canada Hwy going slightly left to BC. About 10 km later, you will see an obvious sign for Lake O?Hara, turn left. The parking is going to be on your right after the railroad. RESERVATION REQUIRED ON THE BUS TO LAKE O'HARA.",
