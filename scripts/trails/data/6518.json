    "description": "This hike begins as a nice walk along a gated road with moderate incline. Stay on the main road, there are many other roads and trails that branch off to the left and right. The road continues to climb as you skirt the base of Mount Manual Quimper. At its highest point there is a nice view over the Charters River Valley to the two unnamed peaks south of Sooke Mountain. The condition of the road then begins to deteriorate as you descend to Charters River. This is one of several crossings you?ll need to make. Some crossings have the remains of old bridges, other have stepping stones. In the winter months there are more running creeks and large puddles to navigate, but none are very difficult. Continue along the main road as it again gains elevation until you reach a large, washed-out junction. Here turn left. Stay on this road a short distance until you reach another road on your left which will lead you to the lake.",
    "directions": "From Victoria follow the island highway west toward Sooke. The island highway becomes Sooke Road. Follow Sooke Road to Saseenos (just before Sooke). Turn Right on Harbourview Road. Park in the CRD parking lot at the end of the road.",
