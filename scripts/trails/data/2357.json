    "description": "If you are an outdoor enthusiast, you have probably visited legendary Cyprus Lake. With its seemingly unreal aquamarine waters, it is perhaps one of Bruce Peninsula's most popular summer destinations.\r\n\r\nBy following the Cyprus Lake Trail north for about 3 km and taking the appropriate turnoff, you can access the other three trails. Each is about a kilometre long and leads to the shore of Georgian Bay. \r",
    "directions": "From the south take hwy 70 north of Owen Sound, then follow the 6 which takes you north through the park. The park is just south of Tobermory.",
