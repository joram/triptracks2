    "description": "Trail goes from Spruston Road to Timberland Lake.  It has trail marks indicating it is part of the Trans-Canada Trail.\r\rThe first 2/3 is along a ridge through a very nice forest. The last 1/3 is along logging roads through a clearcut. (Don't believe the out-of-date imagery from google earth.) The trail ends at the lake where you can picnic and swim.",
    "directions": "Turn off the Island Highway onto Spruston Road and watch for signs of trail head opposite a large turnout.",
