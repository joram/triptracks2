    "description": "Eagle Pass Twin Lakes , a good hike great views , more to explore east of the lakes up the ridge  behind Eagle Pass Mountain. It is alpine , so watch the weather and early spring and late fall wait for the snow to leave. From her you can also hike to Eagle Pass Mtn. Much more difficult and more time.",
    "directions": "East of Sicamous BC  West of Taft on Hwy 1 turn up the Forest Road 4x4 road it is a 4x4 road towards the end so be prepared. Parking is limited arrive early. See google earth for more road info.",
