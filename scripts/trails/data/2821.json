    "description": "NTS Map: 011I03\nthis trail system is relatively new, being pieced together from older portions, and new re-routes to avoid a cranky land owner.\nThe path follows the gully created by the Green creek, and subsequently, offers some great hilly features and river crossings.\nThe map shows Tresspass road, and should be avoided at all costs, as it cuts through private land where we do not have permission to ride.\nthis is a great trail at any time of the year, and offers a wide variety of varying challenges, from tough climbs, creek crossings, and bolder piles.\nIt's not a marked trail, but is easy to follow in the summer months.",
    "directions": "Take the Appin road from the TCH 1, and drive 3 or 4 minutes until you find a field with a barn style garage. The enterance to the trail is a log road that passes on the left of the garage. The path enters the woods at a sharp right and goes from there.",
