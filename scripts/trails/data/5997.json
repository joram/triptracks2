    "description": "Reminds me of Porcupine trail, but not as long or scenic.  Its mostly double track with bits of technical rock climbing and descending.  For the most part, the trail is easy, but requires abit of climbing .",
    "directions": "This can be done as a loop with about 10miles of road riding or point-point and eliminate the road part.  From Hwy 191 head south to San Juan Country road, head East on this road to Spanish Valley Dr.  From there head south on this road and veer left to take Geyser Pass rd.  Follow this road until you get to Meader Ranch Rd and head East.  You will find parking about 1-2k's down the road around or before you hit gravel.  Park here.\nAccommodations:\nA lot of people hiking and biking in the MOAB area stay at condos managed by www.moabutahlodging.com, speak with Andrea. They offer a range of in town homes and condos.",
