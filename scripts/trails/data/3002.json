    "description": "Short Hills Provincial Park contains an extensive trail system for visitors to enjoy at any time of the year. The trails are classified by the use that is permitted on them. Three of the trails (Terrace Creek, Scarlet Tanager, and Hemlock Valley) are classified as Hikers Only, and are indicated by blue markings. Three other trails (Swayze Falls, Very Berry, and Black Walnut) are classified as shared use and are marked in yellow. The activities that are permitted on these trails include biking, hiking, and horseback riding. The remaining trail is the Palaeozoic Path which has been developed with the beginner hiker in mind. The Palaeozoic Path has a hard surface which is covered in gravel to give people with disabilities the opportunity to experience the park.\r",
