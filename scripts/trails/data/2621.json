    "description": "NTS Map: 082J11It's 15Km from the Upper Kananaskis Lake parking lot.  5-6hr to run the 30Km.  Or a two-day hike.  Campsites along the way at the Forks and at Turbine Canyon.  Awesome view of the surrounding peaks along the way.  Crossing Mountain streams and meadows.  The trail gets much steeper after the Forks.  The Canyon at the end is pretty neat.  Who would have thought a little mountain stream can carve out such deep canyon (gotta be 200m deep!)  For the dare devils, you can try jumping over the canyon at the head, it's about couple meters wide but a slip and fall is fatal!Add another steep 3Km to visist Haig Glacier and the Canadian National Ski team training facility high on the glacier.  The view up there is even more amazing.",
    "directions": "Trail starts from Upper Kananaskis lake, follow directions to the Forks.  At the Forks campsite, stay right to go to Turbine Canyon, left to Three Isle Lake.Editors Note:  Attached GPS data is approximate, planned from Topo maps (but good quality topos).",
