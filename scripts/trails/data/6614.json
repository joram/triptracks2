    "description": "Goat trail is said to be Coquitlam's hidden secret equivalent of the Grouse Grind. It is a short and steep trail that leads to a rewarding end at the side of the pretty Munro Lake. The trail is well marked and easy to follow.  Probably two to three hours to head up, less if you are fit and fast. Have a nice lunch at Munro lake, and head down in another couple of hours. If you are adventurous, you can go further to Dennett Lake. \nThe trail is quite narrow in spots and if it has recently rained you will get soaked, so be prepared.",
    "directions": "Access is off Quarry Road. Park at the side of the road. To get to Quarry Road, go on to Coast Meridian road, heading north from Lougheeed hwy, and take a right turn on Victoria Road. After a while Victoria road forks. Take the left fork to stay on to Victoria road. After some distance it turns to Quarry Road. Trail head is approx 5.7 km from the Victoria Road/Victoria Road fork. It is not well marked.",
