    "description": "Top 1/3 is stunt after stunt, lots of log rides, ladder bridges, drops. Middle third is fast and flowy with a spattering of jumps, drops and log rides, and the bottom third is fast and dusty singletrack with a sweet built jump over a barbed wire fence (kinda sketchy the first time).Bike shop / rentals: Freedom Bike Shop Accomodations: Summerland Resort",
    "directions": "About 7 km's up Arawana Road in Naramata, park at Cow's End, find a small trail leading north, this will take you to the camp area where the fun begins.",
