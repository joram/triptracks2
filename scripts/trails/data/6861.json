    "description": "This is a favourite walk and a paradise for dogs who love water. It has several stream crossings and can be quite wet, especially at the beginning. Near the end of the trail it can become a bit rough but the majority is well maintained. I do believe that at the end you can cross the river (it's usually quite shallow) to continue on the other side. I have spotted several eagles along this path, especially early in the morning.\nAs I understand it, this trail was once part of the post road that came up the Valley from Annapolis Royal. In the late 1800s someone was going to build a mill on the river about 1km upstream from White Rock and thus some improvements were made on the road. The mill was never built, however.",
    "directions": "From central Wolfville (Gaspereau Avenue), take HiWay 1 west for about 5.0 km to Deep Hollow Road.  Turn South for a further 4.0km and park just after the bridge.",
