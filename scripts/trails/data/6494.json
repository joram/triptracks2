    "description": "Lovely shaded hike through a tropical rain forest. Path can be very slippery when wet (most of the time as it is a rain forest). \nIt's a very popular hike so expect a number of people to be on the trail. Manoa Falls are high falls, the amount of water depends on recent rains. Lyon Arboretum is in the same area and also contains a number of interesting trails.\nNote most of the vegetation is not original Hawaiian but the result of replanting in the 1920's",
    "directions": "Trail is an the End of Manoa Road.\nIt's accessible via The Bus - Using Public Transportation (TheBus): Take the #5 bus into Manoa valley, and get off at the last bus  stop. From there, it's about a 0.6 mile walk up past Paradise Park to the arboretum. Call TheBus  information center at (808) 848-5555 for more information",
