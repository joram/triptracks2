    "description": "This is not a long hike, but it is a steep one. The end result though, is a view of what I would call one of Kamloops best kept secret. We have very few natural pillars in this part of the Province and I would say the hike is well worth it to see one of the largest I have visited.",
    "directions": "From Kamloops, head East on the Trans Canada Highway and take the Barnhartvale exit. From the exit, travel 8.3km and turn right on Robbins Range Road. Go a further 2.6km until you come to the intersection of Robbins Range and Campbell Range Rds and turn left on Robbins Range. Travel a further 5.3km and on your left you will see a double track (road) going up the hill. You should see some old buildings on your right.Park off the road and start your climb up the road. Though it appears people are driving this road, it is a protected area restricting motor vehicles. My GPS track is consisted of hiking all three hills that comprises the Mt. Buse area. If you want to head directly to the Pillar, take either the first or second left on the road and follow it up. The second left isn?t as extreme a climb. If you want to visit all three as I did, stay right.After a hike to the right, you will come to the summit. You can see most of the valley from this area, but little of the pillar. Head down the first steep part of the road and when it levels out a bit, look for a faint left over road to the right. It is hard to see, but you can tell you are on the right path because of the absence of trees. After a short hike, you will come to another road, head to the right. It is a steep climb, but you will get your first view of the pillar.On your way down to the next hill, after hiking down the steep part, look for a hump to the right. Hike across the top of that and continue across the slope and you will come to another road. This will take you up close for the best view of the pillar. When you get to a sharp bend take the trail to the cliff face and follow it up. Best place for pictures.To return to your vehicle, just follow this road back down.My stats:Total distance: 5.4kmTotal Ascent: 276m (904ft)Total time: 1:30Moving time: 1:16Average Pace: 3.6km",
