    "description": "This hike begins from the trailhead to The Chief in Squamish and ends at the top of the new gondola.  After about 20 mins. up the trail to The Chief take the right fork at a sign for the Upper Shannon Falls trail.  From here the trail will soon pass under the gondola and is well marked in a round-about route to the summit.  An alternate route is turning a sharp left as the trail goes under the gondola and following a steep, direct, flagged route to the top station (many ropes and roots to pull yourself up in spots.).",
    "directions": "Drive North on Hwy. 99 from Vancouver to Squamish.  Park at the trailhead for The Chief.",
