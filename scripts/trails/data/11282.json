    "description": "One last fall to check out when you are near West Gore/ Clarksville, Hants County, Nova Scotia;  Old Sanford Brook Fall.   The other ones are;  Glen Brook Fall, MacInnis Brook Fall and a bit further away O?Toole Brook Fall.Again this is one of those hidden treasures.  Setting off from the logging road you wouldn?t even know there is a stream close by.  However only about 30m separates the road to a deep ravine where the stream flows.  Get by the mixed forest and you will be on the edge of a 60ft plus ravine.  The ravine is either very steep sided with slate rocks or scree slope type overburden.     You make your way to the stream by carefully picking a good route down.  Once don there it is another world!.  Lots of these massive beech trees?.some of the biggest I have seen in NS!  Make your way upstream and after a few hundred metres you come to the 30ft waterfall.  If you decide to walk the waterfall up there are a couple more 5ft upstream as you emerge from the ravine.",
