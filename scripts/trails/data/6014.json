    "description": "Mount Bluff is 505m and overlooks Juan de Fuca Strait and Sooke. I have been hiking this well used trail for many years and unfortunately has fallen into disrepair is some places but is still easily followed to the summit. The climb is quick and quite steep to the top but the views are worth it!Asking permission of the camp caretaker is advised but not really necessary since he is only part time and likely will not be around to answer. His # is 250-642-5924.",
    "directions": "When driving to Sooke from Victoria, turn right onto Otter Point Road once you get into downtown Sooke. Follow this road for 4.7 km until you get to Young Lake Road. You will see a Scouts Canada sign warning you about the turnoff. Follow the road through the camp until you get to N48 24.607 W123 45.615 and park in the field. Look for a rather obvious trail departing from near the co-ordinates into the bush.",
