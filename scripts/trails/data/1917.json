    "description": "The trail starts from beautiful Liscombe Lodge east of Port Dufferin. It starts out with a groomed pea gravel trail and then starts to narrow into wilderness single track.Lots of roots and large rocks to climb over, some bog, which has been bridged by logs. The trail takes you up to an enormous fish ladder for the salmon run and you cross over an awesome waterfall on a suspension bridge.  Make sure you wear good, stiff soled hiking boots. Bring lots of water and trail mix.",
    "directions": "Leaving from Dartmouth, go east on Highway #107 until you get to Musquodoboit Harbour. Go through Musquodoboit Harbour on Highway #7 and follow #7 to Liscombe Lodge. Park at the lodge and hit the trail!",
