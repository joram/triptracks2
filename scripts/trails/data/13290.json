    "description": "I was early for a flight in Deer Lake so I decided to explore something I saw in my gps...underground brook.  The way there was with a logging road.  I soon saw some sinks in the forest and dropped down into one.  I followed the sink and could hear the roar of a waterfall but there was no water around me.  Around a bend, the waterfall (which was a surprise) of about 25ft stood in front of me.  The brook which was flowing quite nicely disappeared completely right after the fall.I followed the series of sinks to see if I could see the brook re-emerge anywhere.  It did!  Almost 1km distant and actually just by the side of highway 430.",
    "directions": "I used a logging rd at N49 21 30.6 W57 32 48.2;  the fall and underground brook is located at;  N49 21 41.8 W57 31 56.1.  It re-emerges at; N49 21 23.6 W57 32 41.1.",
