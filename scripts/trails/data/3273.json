    "description": "Trail is on an old road it dosen't offer much for views till the top. And great views. At 2000m on a clear day you can see Mt. Robson. Whats fun is the downhill, 10km down with no pedaling. Awesome!!",
    "directions": "Located east of the town of Grande Cache about 6km watch for trailhead sign on left.",
