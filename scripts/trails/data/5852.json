    "description": "This trail will take you to a beautiful set of waterfalls in the Nanoose area.  The First 20 minutes is a main logging road. Take the first double track trail on the right. The sound of the falls will take you right where you need to go. You can take a right to a ledge that overlooks the canyon that the falls are in or take a left and head down next to the falls. The trail is roped here and very steep. A slip here means a dip in the water!The first set of ropes is a 100-200 feet and steep at the end. The second and third set are nearly vertical and the rope is poly and slick, very challenging to get back up. Bring gloves!!",
    "directions": "Turn off the highway next onto Sea Blush Drive next to the Arlington Pub in Nanoose BC. Take your first right onto Sundew Place. Start your walk at the end of Sundew Place through the gate.",
