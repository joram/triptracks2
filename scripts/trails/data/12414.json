    "description": "This trail is already on other TrailPeak downloads but the GPS on my download may be a little more detailed.  There are many trails in this area.  This is a loop using 3 pieces of trails (we did it counterclockwise).  This route goes up Prairie Creek Trail then shortcuts down Prairie Link Trail, then back along Powderface Creek Trail.  We hiked but it is obviously a good mountain bike trail as well.Varied Terrain.  Some up and down but no really crushing uphills (no switchbacks).  Starts in mixed Aspen and Fir/Pine forest following a creek.  Fairly narrow valley and the trail is only wide enough for one person.  There are some man made meadows here and there that are actively being used for cattle grazing.  A few gates that have to be opened and closed.Prairie Link goes overtop a hill that is all one type of pine (maybe lodgepole?) that looks like it might have been burned out decades ago.  Looks like the whole forest is set up as a game of pickup sticks with the all of the straight living trees and all of the deadfall on the ground.  Wide enough for 2 side by side (i.e. looks like an ATV or jeep could make the trip).Section of Powderface Creek trail on the way back is also pretty flat and very wide.",
    "directions": "The best place to park is a small lot right on the highway just past the larger parking lot for Elbow Falls because it is in between the start point and end point of the loop.  Going counter clockwise the start point is closer to elbow falls.  If you park in Elbow Falls parking lot it is only a few hundred feet to the start of the trail.  There is 3rd place to park in a  little area off of the road that has a few picnic tables (this lot is where the trail comes out).",
