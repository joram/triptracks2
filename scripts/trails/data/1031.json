    "description": "This was a very technical trail which made trekking poles and good boots worth their money.\r\n\r\nRocks, lots of mud and fallen trees were amongst the obstacles that made the trail a bit harder than it should be. \r\n\r\nMy guess is that by summer the mud should dry out.\r\n\r\nStill, this is not your grandma's nice afternoon walk in the park. The trail climbs 400m to reach a final elevation is 883m.\r\n\r\nAt the peak, the effort was really rewarded by a nice view of the region.\r\n\r\nNote: no need to bring more than 32oz of water per person as their is a waterfall with good water during the trek.",
    "directions": "This trail is located in Parc du Mont-Tremblant and you can access it by the L'Assomption entrance or the Pimbina entrance (halfway between them).\r\n\r\nFor L'Assomption, aim for St-Come with autoroute 31 and route 343 up to Saint-C?me or autoroute 25, route 125 up to route 337 via Rawdon and route 343 up to Saint-C?me.",
