    "description": "Fast and flowy downhill mountain bike trail. Access via several climb options (e.g., Stove to Mushroom head) from Mt. Fernie Park Road, check with a local bike shop for a detailed map and information. I would avoid attempting to access the trail from the west via Stupid and Traverse as it is largely unrideable. S-Bomb is a fast and flowy trail with plenty of switch backs with nice berms. The trail is well built with a few technical sections, small drops (1 ft or less) and optional small jumps. This nearly 600 m descent will be sure to have you grinning the whole way down. The trail switches to Brokeback once you pass the power line which will take you down to Mt. Fergie Park Road.",
    "directions": "Take highway 3 south from town, exit onto Mt Fernie Park Road. Parking is available at the campground or further on the gravel road near a small pedestrian bridge.",
