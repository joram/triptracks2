    "description": "Very steep singletrack; good white-knuckle descent for aggressive bikers, and a moderate hiking trail.  Contains challenging layouts for mountain bikers like jumps, logs, teeter totters etc.  Scenic view of Christina Lake from Beverley's Lookout.",
    "directions": "From the bridge in Christina Lake, go west on Highway #3 for 3 km, turn right on Stewart Creek Road.  Look for trailhead on right at km 9.  The trail descends straight to Westlake Drive.",
