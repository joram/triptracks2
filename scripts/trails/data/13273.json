    "description": "This combination of 3 trails within the park boundaries forms a loop.  Beginning at the lower parking area take the Jodrey Trail through the campground and by several look off points.  We added the Look-Off trail to the hike, but you don't have to... Return via the Woodland Trail to the lower parking area.During the summer months when the campground is open you may be able to drive up the road to the campground and park there, shortening the hike significantly. Come expecting beautiful views of the Minas Basin and Five Islands Provincial Park!",
    "directions": "Take the Greenwich turnoff from Hwy 101 and turn north onto Hwy 358 to Canning.  Turn left onto Pereau Rd. and follow it to Blomidon Provincial Park.",
