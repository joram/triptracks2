    "description": "On my long and so far fruitless search for the McNutt fall near New Annan, I decided to hike in a somewhat remote valley and follow the Freguson Brook to see if it might contain this legend of a fall.The start is through an open field and then you enter the woods and immediately veer off towards the stream.  I was in snowshoes and the steep terrain down to the stream was a good and dangerous workout!   Note to self, take off the snowshoes next time!The valley is very scenic with lots of mature hardwoods.  The stream looks like it has a lot of cascades and small drops.  Then around a corner, a tall rock wall appears and then I couldn't believe it...a cave!The river has carved out a 15ft deep cave in hard rock!  Maybe it's an adit...I just don't know for sure but it's worth the trip!.  I ended up hiking a bit more upstream but the McNutt fall was nowhere to be found!",
    "directions": "Highway 311.  turn on Ferguson Brook Rd and park at the end and hike to the ravine to your right.",
