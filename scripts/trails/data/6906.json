    "description": "Muir Beach is an impressive slice of the Juan de Fuca coastline. The short 2 hour walk will consistently provide views of wildlife: bald eagles, blue herons, seals on rocks and in water, occasionally bears, deer and the odd cougar.  There is an interesting Oligicene fossil area. Choose low tide to visit as there is little or no access otherwise. Rocks are slippery when wet, and by times, storms may cast an abundance of kelp on the beach which will make the going slow. Bring camera and binoculars.",
    "directions": "From Sooke, proceed west on Hwy 14. Just past Anderson Road, the highway drops down to a bridge over Muir Creek. Park on west side of bridge, taking the usual precautions against  theft. Duck under the steel gate(you can ignore No Trespassing signage), and follow the trail to the beach.",
