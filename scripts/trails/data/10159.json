    "description": "A big day singletrack and 4wd road loop over two passes from the Bow Valley into the Kananaskis and then back again.\r\rJewell Pass is the easier of the two. Done from the Canmore side it is a gradual and pleasant climb up double track and 4wd paths to the top. Maps at the top to keep you oriented. Sweet single track downhill on blue/black trail.\r\rAt the bottom you reach Barrier Lake. Turn right at onto Stony Trail and grind up the 4wd road to the Nakiska XC ski area. This bit can be muddy in early season. \rThe climb up through the XC ski area on 4wd roads to the top is a solid grind. With a fast, not particularly technical, run down the other side to the carpark.",
    "directions": "There are several points along the loop at which it can be easily accessed from the road. I started the trail at the carpark just south of Dead Mans Flat, off Highway 1, east of Canmore. You can park at Barrier Lake of highway 40 in the Kananaskis to start from that side and go clockwise if you want to do the harder of the two passes first.",
