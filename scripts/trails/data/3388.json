    "description": "Super easy and flat trail around goldeye lake.  We hiked, but it would be a sweet little rip on a bike.  Some of the boardwalk was a little dodgy on the far side of the lake, but it was still all good.",
    "directions": "Off Highway 11, west of Nordegg.  Just follow the signs to the campground and park there.  The trail can be hiked either way, but we started from the north-east side of the parking area and finished by the boat launch.",
