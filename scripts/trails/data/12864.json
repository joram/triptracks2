    "description": "This 20 km easy traverse is a great way to enjoy the Larch season, without the crowds. The trail is newly upgraded between Boom Lake and Taylor Lake which makes it very pleasant.",
    "directions": "Go west from Calgary, and continue west from Banff towards lake Louise. Leave a return vehicle at the Taylor Lake trailhead. Return to Castle Junction and turn south-west on Hwy 93 to Radium, B.C. and ascend the continental divide. The Boom Lake trailhead is 7.1km down the road on your right (west) side just before you reach the summit of the divide (stay in Alberta) and starts at the end of a well marked parking area.",
