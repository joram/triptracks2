    "description": "Previously I had avoided this trail as the local literature said it was more strenuous than the North Ridge Trail.  I found the opposite to be true.  This is a little longer (2.0 miles to the summit) and less steep than the NRT.  I also preferred this trail.  As you climb, almost every 100 yards you can turn and look at a brand new view to the South.  The increasing height and bare rock provides better views for the entire climb.  There are many ways to descend.  You can take a free bus, you can go down the NRT, go back the way you came, etc.  We chose to hop over to Dorr and go down the Gorge Path.  Lots of options, lots of views and lots of fun.  Enjoy.",
    "directions": "The trailhead is at the entrance to the Blackwoods Campground.  That's on Rt. 3 just South of Otter Creek.",
