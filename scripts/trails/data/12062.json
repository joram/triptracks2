    "description": "illal Peak is one of several in this area including Coquihalla Mtn, Jim Kelly etc with illal being probably the easiest of the 3. The trail is well mark until you arrive at the meadows where it seems to be a free for all. The peak off to the right is illal, Coquihalla in the middle and Jim Kelly on the left. The meadows are wide open with lots to places to explore. To get to the top of illal after you arrive at the lake just below it, head left and go around the back whish has several easy rough trails. The views from the top are outstanding.",
    "directions": "The driving directions in 103 Hikes are spot on. Drive uip the coquihalla past the  old toll booth and exit at the Britten Creek rest area. Turn right on the \"old coquihalla road, then left on the tulameen fsr. About 18.5km after turning onto Tulameen FSR from the highway we crossed Illal Creek and headed up the deactivated spur road. We were driving a Nissan X-Terra and found the spur road to the trailhead to be fairly manageable - although we did have a bit of trailer-hitch scraping on some of the deeper water bars.103 hikes says that the first two kms of the road are 2WD high clearance but unless you are experienced with off-road driving, I don't know if I would bother. It is also worth mentioning that if you like your paint job, don't drive the spur road. There were several VERY brushy sections, especially near the bottom and our truck now has the tell-tale brush carwash stripes on it to prove it.",
