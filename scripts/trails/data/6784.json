    "description": "This trail is rated most difficult. It ascends steeply from the Ketchikan Trail head to a spectacular overlook of Ketchikan and the surrounding area. It is a 2.5 mile hike to the Deer Mountain Recreation Cabin. The trail crosses high alpine ridges and can be dangerous due to elevation and poor weather conditions.  Dramatic alpine scenery makes the hike well worth the effort. Reconstruction of the first mile of the Deer Mountain Trail is just being completed and the trail is well maintained up to the snowline.  I hiked this trail on 28 March 2010 and the snowline was at 1880 ft and made it up to 2400 ft before the snow got too deep and the weather started to turn for the worse.",
    "directions": "The Deer Mountain Trailhead is reached by heading south on Tongass Highway 1/2 mile to Tatsuda's Supermarket. Turn left onto Deermount St. Follow Deermount until it dead ends at T-intersection. Turn right at T, and proceed 1/4 mile to 1st left. Trailhead will be immediately on your right.",
