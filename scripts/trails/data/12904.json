    "description": "A great backcountry route to the Blow Me Down Mountain area. This could be used as a continuation hike from the Lewis Hills area heading north towards Corner Brook or a 2 + day hike alley itself. The route across the Serpentine River up through Simms Gulch is very picturesque and not overly physically challenging. The fun begins when the assent out of the gulch starts (250+ m in less than 1 kilo) in order to get to the tableland plateau. After that its pretty well smooth sailing. We went in mid August and took an additional few days so that we could really explore the area in a relaxing manner and continue on to the Copper Mine Trailhead.",
    "directions": "Either via Logger School Road, a 36 kilo drive off the highway, or via the Serpentine River Road which originates in the Corner area. Both of these roads are only suitable for travel via 4 x 4 truck or quad, etc.",
