    "description": "A short 3 km trail that starts at the far beach parking lot at Alice Lake Provincial Park and follows a single track before it emerges from the forest and becomes part of the maze of trails in the Garibaldi Highlands.\r\nIt can be muddy after a rain fall as was the case on the July 1, 2002 weekend, but if you just want a short after-dinner hike or bike to burn off some calories, this is an easy one.\r\nYou can also use this as an entry point for a longer 20 Km loop following old logging roads around to the Mashiter Trails and eventually up to Cheekeye Road and then back to the campsite along this road.",
    "directions": "Follow Highway 99 north from Vancouver past Squamish to Alice Lake Provincial Park.  At the park entrance take the beach and picnic road and follow it to the end.  It's the same parking area to do the Four Lakes Trail and DeBeck's Hill.  If you?re staying at the campsite, just work your way to the trailhead.\r",
