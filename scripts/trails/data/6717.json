    "description": "This is an easy stroll through a popular nature area. Trail passes through a variety of vegetation but much of it is in the open with no shade. Depending on the time of year a variety of birds and flowers can be seen in the area. It's a relatively flat trail around a portion of one of the few remaining coastal lagoons in the area.We we warned that in summer rattle snakes are known to take over the trail. We're there in March: Depending on the season this may well be worth the visit.On the opposite side you may notice growing fields across Manchester Avenue. A strawberry stand there (next to the Union station) sells the juicy produce. We can vouch for the fact these strawberries taste way better than what you normally find in grocery store.NOTE: No mountain biking please (park rangers have requested we mention this).",
    "directions": "Take I -5 to the Lomas Santa Fe exit. Head east for about 1 mile to Highland Road, then turn left.  After about 0.5 miles turn left on El Camino Real. Drive 0.5 miles the trail entrance is on the left.  Park in the dirt area adjacent to El Camino Real.",
