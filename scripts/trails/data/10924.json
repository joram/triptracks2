    "description": "The Pinnacles area is unique and isolated. Made up of colourful peaks and gem-coloured ponds, it is located in the Whatshan Range of the Monashee Mountains and can be accessed off Hwy 6, an hour's drive east of Vernon at Cherryville. From Cherryville, we drive east 36km up North Fork FSR arriving at the trailhead parking area on the afternoon of the 23rd under mixed skies, feeling somewhat dishevelled from the final rough 4WD section and the fact that we are at the very end of a dusty two week road trip vacation in the mountains (a cold swim would be good). We pack for 2 days and are off up the trail by 6pm climbing steadily through forest past much bear scat, breaking often to munch on blueberries and take in the ever expanding views. A walk through a flowery meadow, a sidehill traverse shouldering a ridge and by 8:00 we are already at the tiny lakes.",
    "directions": "After contouring southwest through a snow pass, we round the west side of a small peak. The way is wide open now and we lose a bit of elevation skirting a cliff band to cross a broad meadowed saddle leading to a flat-topped summit situated one kilometre yonder. We skirt around its north end, passing through a notch to overlook the deep bowl forming the headwaters of Cusson Creek with the impressive north face of Mount Severide looming above. An hour of steep heather sidehilling and we arrive at an important pass above the head of Severide Creek, marking the start of Severide's west (northwest) ridge and a perfect place to pause for lunch",
