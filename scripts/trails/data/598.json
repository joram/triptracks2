    "description": "The trail starts out with a mild incline, just to get the blood pumping, and meanders amongst some of the only old growth cedars on the North Shore and a speckling of ponds. The last 1.5 km (depending on the route) takes you steadily uphill, a great reminder of how out of shape you let yourself get over the winter. \r\nIf you go up in the winter, expect typical snowy scenes; in summer the usual sub alpine wildflowers. It is a great hike to take out-of-towners on--not a killer workout, but with great payoffs.  It feels like you can reach out and touch the Lions.",
    "directions": "From Vancouver, take Hwy 99 North, following signs to Cypress Mountain Ski Area. The trailhead is in the CROSS COUNTRY parking lot, not the downhill, like many of the Cypress hikes.\r\nThe snowshoe trail is clearly marked with orange poles. In the summer, follow the wide road straight up the hill, either staying on the ski runs or hopping over to the marked hiking trail. There are several paths up to the ridge, all well-signed.\r",
