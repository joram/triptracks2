    "description": "Start at the end of Bellamy Road.  Take the first trail on the left to bypass the swamp.  Main intersections will be marked. Follow all signs to Westoby Road.  Just before the creek (that will be dry in summer, difficult to cross during wet weather) turn left. Follow this trail that will wind its way through the forest and skirt the edge of the quarry that is on Millstream Road.  This trail winds it way back into the main trail that you started out on.  You can either continue back to the car or do another small loop that will bring you out right before the swamp bypass.  This trail is in Thetis Lake Park.",
    "directions": "Go up  Millstream Road.  Turn right at Treanor (log house pub).  Turn left at Bellamy (first left past the school). Go to the very end of Bellamy.",
