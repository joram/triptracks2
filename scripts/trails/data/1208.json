    "description": "On April 29, 1903, at 4:10 am, 82 million tonnes (30 million cubic metres) of limestone slid off the summit of Turtle Mountain and buried a portion of the sleeping, mining town of Frank. The dimensions of the rock mass that fell are 150 metres (500 feet) deep, 425 metres (1,400 feet) high and one kilometre (3,280 feet) wide. The mechanism of movement that enabled the rockslide-avalanche to spread over 3 square kilometres (1.2 square miles) of the valley in less than 100 seconds has been the subject of considerable discussion. At daylight, the inhabitants of Frank and area scrambled onto boulders and viewed a grey rocky landscape swirling with dust.  The main part of the town was intact, but the mine entrance and mine buildings were buried.   Seventeen miners trapped inside performed an astonishing self-rescue.  They tunnelled upwards and broke through the surface on the face of the mountain.Out of 600 people in Frank, 100 were in the path of the slide.  Cottages at the east end of town were crushed; amazingly 23 people in that area survived.  Out of approximately 70 people killed, only 12 bodies were recovered.The trail is a moderately steep ridge walk along the west spine of the mountain. A well worn trail proceeds to the first summit. The second requires some down scrambling before ascending again (photo Turtle2). The area burned by the Lost Creek Fire of 2003 is evident along the west face of Turtle Mt. Impressive views of prairies to the east, the Livingstone Range and Crowsnest Mt. to the north and west.Return the way you came or descend down east ridge and exit at Hillcrest (shorter but steeper). A vehicle shuttle permits an easy traverse.Note: This is a scramble. Be aware that scrambling can injure or kill you. Be prepared, know your limits and make sure somebody knows where you're going.NTS Map: 082G09Elevation Gain: 900 m (2,950 ft).",
