    "description": "This is a hike...bushwhack I planned while reviewing an old 1890 map that showed cliffs in this area.  These maps never show cliff features anywhere else in NS so I was curious.  I did an informal survey of the climbing community and no one I spoke to had climbed these or heard of these before.No wonder...to access them is a approximately 20 km dirt road which gets progressively worse but you can still access with a motor vehicle.   Then it?s a 1km bush walk through some of the thicket bush I have seen in many years rambling in Nova Scotia.The old road will soon disappear under alders but you can still follow it to its conclusion.  Then its a scramble through some waist high bushes of ll kind...no need to go to the gym after this one.   After a while you finally descend and then climb the knoll you could see from the start.  On the opposite side of the knoll are some impressive cliffs.  Most of them are multi tier and it would take more than one pitch to summit the knoll.  The road is hard and suitable to climb.  There are a couple of large blocks strewn everywhere at the bottom with lots of medium size crevasses. From the top of the knoll, if you follow my gps track, you will access another area of high cliffs which would be suitable for climbing as well.  So in conclusion...good place to climb but the dirt road and bushwhack probably will deter most people to access these cliffs.",
