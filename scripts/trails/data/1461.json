    "description": "NTS Map: 082O02\nElevation Gain: 495 m (1,625 ft).\nDescription: A popular destination for mountain bikers, this multipurpose trail is great for hiking as well. The initial elevation gain is up a set of switchbacks through the forest, and it's not too violent an ascent. Once up high, you can continue along the broad ridge either North or South. We explored both directions, initially continuing south-east and making our way towards Moose Mountain fire lookout (actually quite far off to the east and quite impressive-looking). We still had time to explore Jumpingpound ridge towards Cox Hill to the north before dropping back down to the cars.",
