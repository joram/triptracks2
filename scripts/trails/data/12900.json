    "description": "We left from a parking area on the 103 hwy just a short hop from the Canada Trail. About 3/4 of the trail we took was on the Canada Trail. Nice views of Labrador Lake on the trail. Turn off of the Canada Trail and head up along well used 4 wheeler tracks as far as they go. The last 100' or so is direct climb up the rocks.",
    "directions": "Parking area on the side of the 103 Hwy just short of the turn off to Chester/East River.",
