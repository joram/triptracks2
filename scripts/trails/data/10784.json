    "description": "A short hike just outside Liverpool.  It?s perfect if you want to stretch your legs as you are making your way down the South shore towards Yarmouth.  The trails are in the middle of a pine grove.  It makes you aware of what a uncut forest in the south shore looks like when it?s left alone.  The pines are towering over you.  Shrubs are mostly small and spaced apart except for some rhododendrons that were transplanted throughout the grove.  Everywhere in the grove you will also see some large outcrops of rocks?perfect for bouldering if you are a 5 year old.  There are a couple of geocaches and some of the trails are close to the Mersey River.",
    "directions": "Highway 103 and exit 19 at Liverpool.  Drive north for 200m and the pine grove park and trails are located to your left.",
