    "description": "Looking for a peaceful hike through the K-Country forest to a pretty little lake (unnamed)? Then this 8.5 km.(return) ~260m. gradual gain is for you.\nFrom the Sawmill day use parking lot start from the map by the outhouse. These trails are part of the xcountry/bike trail system. Head past the gate staying on red/yellow path (r/y/g on map) untill you reach the \"T\". Follow to the left on the yellow/green path. At just over 2km from the trail head a cairned trail leads to your right. This trail soon changes to a game trail and leads to the lake. For the more adventurous, past the lake is a waterfall and a couple of trail options to explore above the tree line in some rugged country with a few more tarns.",
    "directions": "Off Hiway #40 head west on Kananaskis Lakes Trail 2.2 km. to Hiway 742 (Smith-Dorrien - Spray Lakes Road). Go north about 16 km. to Sawmill Day Use. Trail head is in north east corner of parking lot.",
