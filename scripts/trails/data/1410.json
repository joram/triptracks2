    "description": "Ptarmigan Cirque is a high mountain bowl (cirque)above the Highwood Pass in Kananaskis Country. It is billed as an interpretive trail, but the first kilometre is quite steep. But stick with it because the cirque area itself is worth the effort. Besides interpretive trails have those little signs every now and then where you can legitimately stop and rest while you slowly read the text. Once you leave the trees the trail levels out considerably. The landscape in the cirque is quite stark, but the views are fantastic. You can stay on the trail or head further up the cirque along a faint trail. you can also go further up to Mt. Rae from here, but that's a scramble for another time.NTS Map: 082J10Elevation Gain: 230 m (755 ft).The Highwood Pass area is considerably higher in elevation than Lougheed Park, dress accordingly.",
    "directions": "At the Highwood Pass, park in the parking area on the west side of the road. The trailhead is north about 100m and then across the highway. The Highwood Pass, at 7200', is the highest driveable mountain pass in Canada. It is closed every winter for animal management. The Pass is on Hwy 40, about 50km south of Hwy 1.",
