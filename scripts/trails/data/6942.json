    "description": "Cypress Lookout is located at an abandoned microwave relay tower site near the peak of Cyupress Mountain in Coquitlam. The route I have described takes different trails, the long way up and the short way back, but if you are in a hurry you can take the short leg both up and down.\r\rThe trail begins at the end of Plateau Blvd.  on Westwood Plateau in Coquitlam. There is plenty of parking at the trail-head.  Stay right at the first fork.  Going left here would take you along the Westwood Academy golf course. At the 2nd fork you have the option of going right, which is the direct route, or going left, which takes you on a roundabout through a very lovely forest and is less travelled. \r\rCypress Lookout provides a wonderful panormic view. The microwave tower has been taken down but the concrete footings remain.",
    "directions": "Take Johnson Street in Coquitlam all the way to the top. Along the way the name changes to Plateau Blvd and takes you past the Westwood Plateau golf course. There is a widened gravel area for parking or carry on a short distance and park on the shoulder just before the gate.",
