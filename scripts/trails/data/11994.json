    "description": "Mount Coliseum by Nordegg is a good shoulder destination hike, similar to Yamnuska or Nihahi Ridge.  It looks like a blast on a mountain bike.",
    "directions": "100 m west of Nordegg and then follow the signs about 500 metres. From another user:Very nice relaxing hike. Did not meet a single other hiker. Nice views from the top and the walk on the ridge is excellent.",
