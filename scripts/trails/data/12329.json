    "description": "The Nictaux River has a place called Nictaux Fall but unfortunately the falls were dammed off a while ago.  However, upstream lies a beautiful area called the Alpena rapids.There are two ways to get to it..you can use the old rails to trails from nictaux Falls but it will take many hours to get to alpena.  Or you can take the old Crisp Rd.  The road is suitable for hiking and mtn biking.  It traverses a mixed forest and loses some elevation when you get close to the Nictaux River.  Once you hit the intersection with the rail to trail head towards the river....there is no official path here but you can here the rapids.  There is an old wall by the rapids...maybe an old mill?  also numerous signs that people camp by the rapids.",
    "directions": "Highway 10.  Park on the corner of highway 10 and alpena Rd and follow the old road in the woods towards the Nictaux River",
