    "description": "Bullhead Mountain trail is located near the W.A.C. Bennett dam, and is very short, taking about one hour to get to the top. The trail is quite steep, however, with the average grade being close to 25 degrees. The trail also appears to be the bed of a dry creek, so hiking after the rain or when the ground is muddy might be complicated. Also, while there is a good parking spot near the trailhead, the ground at the entrance to that parking spot is uneven, and low clearance vehicles might not make it without bottoming out and, at least, getting some scratches.\n\nSource: http://www.ihikebc.com/trips/2016/trip108BullheadMountainTrailHike.htm",
    "directions": "To get to the Bullhead Mountain Trailhead, drive to the town of Hudson's Hope located on Highway 29 in Northeastern British Columbia, between Chetwynd and Fort St. John, and then follow directions to W.A.C. Bennett dam. You would take Canyon Drive for about 15 kilometers, until Twelve Mile Road would appear on the right side. Canyon Drive would then continue on the left for 4.3 km to the dam, while you would turn to the right onto Twelve Mile Road. Then, five hundred meters later, the trailhead would be on the right side (a green-and-white stand in the photo below), while parking is available at the square yellow sign seen ahead.\n\nSource: http://www.ihikebc.com/trips/2016/trip108BullheadMountainTrailHike.htm",
