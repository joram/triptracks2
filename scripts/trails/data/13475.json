    "description": "Again, I'm stuck exploring in my community so I decided to get on a stretch of river that always piqued my interest on sat imagery.  Cow Bay River drains Lake Morris and is about 4 km long to the ocean.  Part of the river...ok not really a river more of a brook, are fully engulfed in shrubs but the middle part is quite different being open and wide!\n\nThere is a public access point at the end of a road and people have beaten a path to the river so I know I'm not the only one that has paddles there.  I went off for a bit more than 1 km downstream and perhaps 300m upstream.  the downstream part could be longer if you are willing to bushwack about 200m to get to another open section of the river.  The bugs were bad the day I was there so I retreated before doing that part.",
