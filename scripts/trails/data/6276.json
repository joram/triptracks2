    "description": "Bathurst lakes in the Mount Carleton park are pristine and what I would call the hidden jem in NB. When arriving at the entry point to the Bathurst lake area, you will find a clean open area which will give you a view not only of the first lake you will encounter but a nice view of the highest point in Atlantic Canada Mt Carleton. I marked river but as we know these are lakes. You will see lots of moose/ wildlife in this area. Please respect the eco system and take out your trash.",
