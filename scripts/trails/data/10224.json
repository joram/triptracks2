    "description": "This is a great *ROAD RIDE* loop on the roads northwest of Cochrane. Grades are gentle, with only a few moderate hills. Scenery is rural acreages, farms, and ranchland, with views of the foothills and mountains. \nIt is pretty much all up on the way out and all down home on Grand Valley Road which is a nice, coasting, scenic road with some gentle swooshes (S turns) to add some interestingness to the funness.\nTotal distance is about 50 km, with the option to ride up the Cochrane hill east of the parking lot at the end of the ride.",
    "directions": "Park at Cochrane Ranche in Canmore.  \nDeparting from the Cochrane Ranche parking lot, ride west about 3 km on Highway 1A to Horse Creek Road. We then ride North on Horse Creek Road for about 20 km, west on an unnamed connector road (TWP 280) for 3 km, south on Grand Valley Road about 15 km, and finally east on Highway 1A again about 8 km back to Cochrane.",
