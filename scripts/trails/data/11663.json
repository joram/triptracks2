    "description": "Another short hike to a waterfall.  I chose to explore this waterfall as I was already in the area looking for the mysterious Mulgrave Lake Knoll and Cliffs (see another post on this one).  This is a pretty straightforward bushwhack to two distinct waterfalls.  these falls are of no great height but that comes with the territory when seeking falls on the eastern shore.  The forest on the eastern side of the brook is pleasant enough to walk through and is mainly conifers with a few deadfall to make you work for it.",
