    "description": "Back during ww2 a plane crashed on the mountain and you can now visit the memorial site left over.  It's a 3 minute hike off a logging road if you have a 4x drive or about 30-45 minutes up if you are 2x drive.  You can also busheack a little further up from the crash to find the 2 plane wings which have broken off but they are hard to find.",
    "directions": "The forest service road (Mount Bolduc FSR) is accessed off Gordon Mainline about 15 km from Lake Cowichan (where the road turns to dirt just past Gordon Bay Campsite), there's a road heading over to Harris Main (Pacific Marine Highway) and the turn off for the FSR is about 2 km along that road. You head up the FSR (ignoring the sign saying not to) and go up about 5-6 km and the trail will be marked with a ribbon near the very end of the loggind road.  If you are in a 2 wheel drive with low clerance, you can make it up pretty far but will nave to get out and hike for a few kilometers at one point.  There should be a spot on the cliffside just barely big enough to turn your car around and leave it parked on the slope as you ascend the rest of the way on foot.",
