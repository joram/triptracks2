    "description": "A spectacular peak with views north and west, Mt Erskine is part of a larger protected area of almost 240 hectares with a variety of trails, including a steep public access trail from Collins Road. Dogs are permitted as long as they are on a leash.  Unfortunately, loose dogs disturb ground nesting birds and other critters who consider this their home.",
    "directions": "It is recommended hikers access Mount Erskine Provincial Park via the Mount Erskine Upper Access Park Reserve owned by the Capital Regional District (CRD). This access is located in the Rainbow Grove Subdivision at the end of Trustees Trail. From this point Dodds Trail enters the park and provides linkage to the rest of the Mount Erskine trail system.",
