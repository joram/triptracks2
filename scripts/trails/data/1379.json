    "description": "The Lake Laurentian Conservation area consists of 950 hectares (2400 acres) of protected green space just minutes from downtown Sudbury.  The lake itself is a nice place to paddle around and relax without the noise and waves of motorboats and PWC that are usually found on Lake Ramsey.  The lake isn't huge, so the water is typically calm.  It's fairly shallow in a few spots so on good days you can see some bottom structure and there's some small islands to explore.  Watch out for Canada geese that nest by the hundreds in the fens at the eastern end of the lake!\n   For more info check out http://www.nickeldistrict.ca/ndca/.",
    "directions": "Turn onto Ramsey Lake road at Science north and travel for 2km to the turnoff for South Bay road.  Follow South Bay road for 2km until you see the sign for the Laurentian Conservation are on the right.  The area is open from 8am till 4pm spring till fall.",
