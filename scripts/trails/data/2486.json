    "description": "Crinkum Crankum starts with a series of tight technical switch backs, then descends a number of steep and often slippery ramps to drop onto a T intersection that has double black left variant, and single black right, but joins  again a short while later.  If you go right, there's a sneaky left you have to take a short way along avoid being taken back to the road.\nOnce the trail joins the Cedar Trail, continue on right to complete your ride with upper and lower Griffen, or Roadside Attraction.\nThis trail is normally done as a continuation of Leopard and Kirkford, though it's start can be accessed from a short joiner trail that comes off Mountain Hwy at the third main switchback corner from the turnaround gate.\nMore Mt Fromme mountain biking trails can be found here.",
    "directions": "At the top of Mountain Hwy in North Vancouver, park south of the orange locals only parking signs. Ride up to the end of the road and enter the park throught the first gate.\nLocal Conditions:\n                  \t\nfootage of last couple of ramps\n\nmore mountain biking videos can be found here",
