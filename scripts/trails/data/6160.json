    "description": "There are many trails to choose from.  All start at the same place.  The Blue, orange and English River trails are east of the staging area and follow the Winnipeg River.  The Red trail is West of the Staging and follows the Pinawa Channel's North Side.  The Trans Canada Tail can also be accessed from here.  The trails are great in the winter when the bogs are frozen, but the blue and English river trails require some swamp slogging.  There are huts on a few of the trails.  Expect bugs, rocks and wet trails, typical of this Canadian shield setting.",
    "directions": "Highway 211 off highway 11.  The road is about 10km and dead ends at Pinawa.  The town is pretty cool and situated along the Winnipeg River.  The highway ends at a gravel turn around by a diversion dam.  Park your car and head across the dam to the map and trail head.",
