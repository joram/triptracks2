    "description": "The highest fall near Wentworth valley is Annandale Falls and is just a quick 10 minute return trip to see from the highway.  The terrain to get down to the base of the falls is very steep and there are some ropes to help you on the way down.\r\rYou enter the forest and follow the dirt road on the right for not even a minute and you will hear the falls.  At that moment you are almost on top of them.  You can make your way to the stream with the dirt road and then walk downstream to the top of the fall\r\rTo make your way down to its base, you need to follow the faint trails that cut into the wood downstream of the brook and on the same side of the brook as your car.  The forest is composed of tall evergreen mature trees and is quite shaded in the summer.  You come down the slope with the trail and there are some roped sections to help you.  At last you are at the stream?s edge follow it upstream to the massive waterfall.  It must be at least 60 feet.  It runs on the rock face but looks steep enough for ice climbs.\r",
    "directions": "Take highway 246 at Wentworth station and drive for about 5.75km (45\u00b0 37.516'N, 63\u00b0 29.845'W).  There is a dirt road on the right.  Take it to past the blueberry field on your left and park at the Y intersection.  The falls are up ahead and to your right.",
