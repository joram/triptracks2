    "description": "NTS Map: 082J15Prairie Mountain is a popular hike that many use to start off their season in the spring.  Aside from a cornice that will stay for most of the spring, the mountain is usually bare.  It's a grueling hike about 3km in length to the top of the mountain.  For it's length, the elevation gain is high and fast.The trail starts right off with steep switchbacks and levels off at the top of a forested ridge. At the top of the ridge a few clearings will give you a nice view of the valley.  After the relatively low slope of the ridge, be prepared for more switchbacks until you clear the treeline.Once you clear the treeline its a gradual slope with a cliff on the east side up to the summit which is marked by a cairn with a large stick.  There are some small trees near the summit for a windbreak as you have lunch or a snack and enjoy the 360 degree panorama view.  Looking North you'll see Moose Mountain Fire lookout.  To the east you'll see Calgary on a sunny day, and to the south the MacLean Creek area with it's multitude of OHV trails.It's a great hike I've done three times now, but it is a leg burner.  Bring poles if you have any knee problems as it is steep.  Kids would have no problems with this hike and there is very little exposure with the only hazard being the cliffs at the summit.",
    "directions": "22 km west of Bragg Creek, you can turn off highway 66 at the Elbow Falls Parking lot.  Park on the North side of the road on the shoulder at the winter closure gates.  The trail is well-defined and heads straight up (North) from the highway.",
