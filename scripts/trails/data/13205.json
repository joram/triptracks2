    "description": "Not the biggest fall you will see  in Cape Breton but quite unexpected.  An old map from 1880's showed a 35ft fall.  The brook you follow from the road is quite small so UI had my doubts. However, the valley eventually narrows and a 25ft fall appears.  Don't go in the summer unless it rained the day before.",
    "directions": "Highway 105. In Kingsville,  turn right on Riverside Rd and then turn left on Cenotaph Rd.  Continue on Cenotaph (don't go straight on Big Brook Rd).  Brook crosses road at N45.72972\u00b0 W61.23630\u00b0.  Follow brook upstream for 1km to fall.",
