    "description": "A short hike on the side of the highway perfect to stretch your legs and see some magnificent sites in the backwoods of Nova Scotia.Setting off from the highway you might think this hike has nothing to offer.  However only after a few minutes and setting off in a due east direction you will enter a mature pine grove.  What a site.  The moss carpet is deep and luxurious and really cushions your steps.  Try to find the Tupper brook which comes tumbling down from the hill behind.  As the terrain gets steeper, the brook will have numerous cascades and falls.  All of the falls are basically just past a well maintained wood road.  There are numerous large boulders in the area as well.  The falls are small but the scenery of them in the pine grove makes this a worthwhile trip.",
