    "description": "The Apex Trail starts at the top of Knox Mountain in down town Kelowna.  It makes its way down Knox Mountain through the open forest on a gravel trail.  It can be hiked in either direction, but I sure don't recommend biking up it.  Its got some small berms in the switchback sections so you can get some good speed, but be careful, its also a popular trail with hikers.  There are good views of Okanagan Lake and Kelowna from the top and the viewpoints on the way down.",
    "directions": "The trail head is at the top of the Apex Lookout on Knox Mountain.  You can also start at the parking area at the bottom of the mountain and hike up.  To get to the park, take Ellis Street north from Bernard Ave or Harvey Ave (Hwy 97).  Ellis Street renames itself to Knox Mountain Drive as it enters Knox Mountain Park.  Follow Knox Mountain Drive to the top.  This road is closed in the winter.",
