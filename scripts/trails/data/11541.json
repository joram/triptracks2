    "description": "This is a short hike on the Bay of fundy to a pretty waterfall tumbling into water at high tide and dropping about 15ft to the seafloor at low tide.  I had been here previously but the tide was up so I couldn't get to the base of the fall.  Start from the wharf and walk on the cobble beach due east.  You should be able to see the waterfall about 700m away.  close to the waterfall are two small cavities which looked like they were mined for minerals.  Around the corner from the fall, the cliffs continue and access becomes non existant.  my next adventure would take me from there all the way to the outlet of Bishop Brook!",
    "directions": "Make you way to Margaretsville on the Bay of fundy.  Park near the lighthouse or the wharf and walk due east to the fall.",
