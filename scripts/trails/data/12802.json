    "description": "Great hike to a beautiful sub-alpine lake on a good trail. This trail is not very busy, and probably doesn't see too many hikers in any given summer, but it is well maintained by the Kootenay Backcountry Horsemen. The trail starts off steep, and levels off as you approach the first notch at N49.02291 W114.93732. From there, you descend into a beautiful open meadow with the steep slopes of a high ridge to your left. Easy walking takes you to the second notch at N49.03400 W114.95624. The trail veers sharp left here, a short descent after the notch - watch for flagging tape. You meander through the forest, heading generally northwest until you reach the final short, steep ascent to the lake at N49.03893 W114.96695.",
    "directions": "Note that directions in the guidebook are a bit off - the trailhead is closer to 12 km along Phillips Creek FSR, not far after the 43 km sign. If you come to the 44 km sign or hit Galton Pass, you've gone to far. The trailhead at N49.01543 W114.92560 is not signed.",
