    "description": "A great set of trails, with some great technical features and easy to get to.  WAY better than I expected, I rode about 20 km and could have kept going back for more but it was supper time.  Even better it was at night, 8 PM in warm, dry October, I could hear all kinds of critters scampering along in the crunchy leaves though I only saw one, a bunny hopping along in front of me.There was a nice range of trails from flat wheat fields to some seriously steep gnar, and even a set of 5-6 quite tight switchbacks to navigate down.  Steep also well describes many of the climbs, though they are thankfully relatively short.  There is about 65-70 meters of absolute altitude difference between the downtown / parking area and the riverside, so going up and down a few times will easily get you anaerobic if that's your goal.  My tracklog added up to 512 m of climbing (and 510 m of descending, so I trust it).I think I even saw some lights in the trees and an old pulley system - they *may* use the lights for cross-country skiing? Or was it for an old DH skiing area?",
    "directions": "The North side of downtown, the road into Devon Voyageur Park, the Lions  Campground and Michigan Street all give you access to this network of  trails.  Then run on the South bank of the North Saskatchewan River East of Hiway 60.",
