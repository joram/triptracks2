    "description": "The trail is 1.5 km each way with 250 m of vertical to a natural arch measuring 44 meters wide, 4 meters thick and 20 meters off the ground. Most of the trail has a moderate grade with switch backs but some sections can be steep. There are many steep ledges and some sections of loose  material. A small steep creek crossing can be swift in spring and might be difficult for dogs to cross.",
    "directions": "The trail head is in a bay opposite (southwest) of Deer Park on Lower Arrow Lake. The trail head sign is small but can be found north west of some  cabins and docks.Access to the trail head is via water. There are many places to launch a canoe or kayak from Deer Park. Launching a boat in Deer Park might be difficult as the launch would be from a natural beach. The crossing is about 2.1 km. The closest concrete boat launch is at Syringa Creek Provincial Park  day use area about 15.5 km southeast on Lower Arrow Lake.",
