    "description": "The first half to Rawson lake is an easy, although steady incline hike on a well established trail that is quite popular on the weekends.  The second half of the hike up to Sarrail Ridge is a steep 45 minute climb, not quite a scramble but the use of poles is recommended.  The climb is worth it though as it gives an awesome view of Upper Kananaskis lake to the North and Rawson lake to the South East.Travel west from Calgary on the Trans Canada, then take highway 40 south into Kananaskis and go for about 50 kilometers, then turn right onto the Kananaskis Lakes Trail.  Proceed about 12 kilometers and turn left to the Upper Lake Day Use Area.  The trailhead is at the south end of the parking lot.",
