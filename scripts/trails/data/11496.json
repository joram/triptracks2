Beginners will enjoy the view, various pitstop lookouts, and there are many info signs that kids enjoy reading that give great detail on the surrounding area. Experienced hikers will enjoy the heart pounding uphill adventure, with many side trails to discover. Count the many Teapots placed along the trail.  Park in the Teapot Hill lot.  Hike back along the highway to the Clear Creek campsite.  Take the Seven Sisters Trail,  turn right on the International Ridge Trail to the Horse Loop trail.  Continue along the Horse Loop Trail.  Bare right at the Watt Creek Intersection.  Take the next right to the steep climb to the top of Teapot Hill.  Follow the Teapot hill trail back to the parking lot.",
