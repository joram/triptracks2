    "description": "Trip from Jordan Main logging road to Tower Cabin.  This trail arrives at a set of cabins, which, is operated by the KOC.  (Editor's note:\": There is considerable controversy over the use of these cabins, in terms of public/private land, club membership, access, use, and other trails, points, beaches reachable from these cabins.). We take it this submitter is posting GPS tracks to the tower to clear up confusion on the route into this area.  As to who can access and how, that information was not provided by the submitter of this information).\n( Another user writes:   \nA fantastic ramble through subalpine meadows. Take the logging road opposite the road to the Parkinson Creek access to the Juan de Fuca trail. Follow this uphill to the end. Rock cairns and a flag in a tree mark the west end of the trail. )",
    "directions": "Continue Hwy 14 beyond Sooke to Port Renfrew. Just past Joran River and just before China Beach campground, follow Joran Main logging road from N side of hwy.",
