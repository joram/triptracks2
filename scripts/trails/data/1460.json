    "description": "NTS Map: 082G01Elevation gain - 275 m (900 ft).Summit Lake is the first destination point on the 20km  Alderson-Carthew Trail in Waterton Lakes National Park, or simply a nice, moderately easy dstination in itself. The lake sits high on a plateau above Cameron Lake. Starting at Cameron Lake, follow the trail to the left crossing the bridge over Cameron Creek and follow this trail around the lake. Soon the trail veers left up a series of moderate switchbacks through spruce forest, with nice views down to Cameron Lake, eventually levelling off about 1km from Summit Lake.From this point you can turn left and proceed to the Alderson-Carthew trail (ends at Waterton townsite), or the Boundary trail, which dips into Glacier National Park (USA), then follows the Waterton Lake shoreline to the townsite.The photo above left is Cameron Lake, above right is Summit Lake. Distance and time are one way.\r\nIn winter please check the Avaluator\r\n(Online Trip Planner) rating is: \r\n Challenging.  \r\nSee more trip planner route details here.\r\n\r\nCurrent conditions:\r\n\r\n\r",
