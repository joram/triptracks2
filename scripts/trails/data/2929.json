    "description": "La Montagne Coupee is a popular cross-country ski center 1 hour north of Montreal.\r\rIt offers 10 or so trails totaling 65km of groomed cross-country ski trails. 55 of those km are groomed for both classic and skate; there is an advanced 10km loop that is only for classic.\r\rOn this day, I did the 9km loop that takes you down to the Assomption river. It's a very fun 130m descent down to the river for the first 2.8km. Of course, what goes down must come up, but I found the up very fair. It's over 3.6km, and the views along the way are gorgeous.\r",
    "directions": "From Montreal, se rendre a Joliette via the 31 which becomes the 131. Follow the 131 to the center. It is located on the left just before you arrive to St-Jean-De-Matha.",
