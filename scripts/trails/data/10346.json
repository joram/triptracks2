    "description": "The trail is part of collection of trails around the Calabogie Ski area.  The Manitou Mountain trail itself is linear however there exists several loops on other trails that allow a looped path return.  There are 3 lookouts on the trail, Red Arrow, Manitou, and Eagle's Nest.   Part of the trail is along an old logging road with very easy terrain.  The eastern end of the trail has several up and down sections.  The following link contains a map of the trail and surronding area.http://www.calabogie.com/images/pdf/manitou-trails-map_web.pdf",
