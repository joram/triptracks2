    "description": "This trail starts on an old logging road but you have to turn quickly into the wood and down the ravine.  At the bottom of the ravine is the tributary to the east branch of the Folly River.  Where the tributary meets the East Branch is a very nice waterfall of about 50 feet with a smaller one upstream.  I went all the way upstream of the tributary but did not find any more big waterfalls so stick to the downstream part of the tributary.",
    "directions": "Take highway 4 towards Wentworth valley.  At the top of the pass, take a right on Stevens Rd extension.  Cross the Folly river and take first right (300m from highway 4).   Continue on this dirt road to the power lines.  At the T intersectuion under the power line take a left.  Follow this road to about ( 45.515107\u00b0, -63.514865\u00b0)",
