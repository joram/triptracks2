    "description": "Park at Gowland-Tod Park parking lot, and take one of two routes down to the water at Mackenzie Bight.  Return on the other path.  The southern trail leads fairly level through forest for about 2 km, then descends 180 metres over 1 km, alongside a waterfall.  This is a relatively easy hike down, but would be considerably more difficult up.  Picnic by the sea at Mackenzie Bight, or throw the ball with the dog, and explore.  The northern trail back up to the parking lot is an easier climb than the southern route, and climbs fairly steadily the 180 metres back up over the course of 1.5 km.  This is a wider path, used also by horses and riders.",
    "directions": "Take Pat Bay highway north from Victoria, exit on Royal Oak Drive, go west, and turn right onto West Saanich Rd at the 3rd lights.  Veer left onto Wallace Rd after the Red Barn Market (about 2.5 km), then left after 1 km onto Willis Pt Rd.  \nDrive for 3 km and turn left to enter Gowland-Todd Park - the parking lot is right there, and the trail entry on the north side of the road.  There are maps mounted and the trail easy to pick up.",
