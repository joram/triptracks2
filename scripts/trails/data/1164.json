    "description": "This trail is easily accessible from the cruise ship docks and the ferry terminal.  The trail starts with a steep hike up the hill on the east side of town.  After about eight or nine switchbacks you will reach Lower Dewey Lake.  You will hike along the lake for a ways and then continue along the bench loosing elevation slowly.  We hiked through one boggy area that required nimble feet.  When you get to a fork in the trail you will want to head right.  Shortly after the fork you will come to a rocky slope that pitches steeply down to the creek on your left.  Take care not to trip or slip.  You follow the creek down to a picnic area by the Lynn Canal.  A great place to watch the boats go by.",
    "directions": "Take Second Street east until you cross the creek.  Follow the railroad tracks about 250m.  Here you will see a jeep trail heading up the mountain to the east.  Follow this road.  About 200m look for a wooden stairway heading down the hill to the right.  The trail passes under two pipes here then heads on up the hill on the other side.  Even if you can't make it out to the landing the first km of the trail gives you two or three overlooks of town.",
