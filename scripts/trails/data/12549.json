    "description": "This trail allows for a beautiful walk though the low lands of the Quinsam River through a gigantic Douglas fir forest interspersed with cedar trees, some of which are almost a thousand years old. The trail is flat and forested and follows the Quinsam River upstream to the Quinsam Salmon Hatchery.",
    "directions": "Access can be gained from Elk Falls Provincial Park camp ground, just follow the camp ground  road paralleling the river to the end. Park by the gate and look for the trail that follows the river for a short time then veer right.",
