    "description": "Boom Lake trail is located on Highway 93, about 10 km west of Highway 1.  The trailhead has a nice parking lot and washrooms.  The trail begins with a small bridge crossing and then climbs sharply for a short distance before turning into an easy to modest climb for the rest of the trip.  Some nice views of storm mountain and the Kootenay Valley peak through the trees, otherwise it is mostly very nice and serene forest.  Suddenly the trail opens up to reveal Boom lake, which is certainly one of the most beautiful locations in the Rockies.  The lake is surrounded by dramatic mountains, and a trail follows around the northeast shore.  Prepare to take lots of pics and spend some time at the lake.",
    "directions": "Take Highway 1 north of Banff and continue to Castle Junction.  Turn onto Highway 93 toward Radium.  The trailhead parking is just a km past Storm Mountain Lodge, on the right.",
