    "description": "Edwards Rating: I (II) M SGreat easy hike with rewarding view of Spray Lakes on a side and then, Old Goat Glacier on the way to trail's end. It starts with 2-3 km of easy walk through the forest and in a dried out bed creek (in July it is!). Can be a little bit confusing there, but it's a short part of the hike. You'll see a nice fall once you get out that creek. Then, it gets steeper for about 1km, but not exposure really and still, very easy if you are an intermediate or expert hiker-scrambler, even for beginners who hiked a couple of times. We did it in 3h30min. total up to the end of that little ridge going up to the Glacier. Around 10.5 km total with 717 m elevation gain at 2426 m, nice little hike I would say! Could be done in 4 hours or so if you don't hike that often and under 3 hours otherwise. We had to take our time as my partner had a sprained ankle lately.",
    "directions": "From Canmore downtown, it takes around 25-30 minutes. Take Rd 742 (Spray lakes Rd) up to Spray Lakes reservoir, then turn right at the Campground site of Spray Lakes. Once your on the other side of the Lake and on your left, you need to go for 1.5-2 km on Campground's road and you'll see an improvised parking lot on your right with a red water pump, this is the trail head!",
