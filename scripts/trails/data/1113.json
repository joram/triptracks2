    "description": "NTS Map:92B6.  The Swan Lake/Christmas Hill trail system is a 2.5 km loop and .5 km trail that covers the urban wetland of Swan Lake.  Maintained by the Capital Regional District, Swan Lake is home to numerous birds and small mammals, even beside the busy highway.  It also features a great nature house with educational displays for younger audiences.  Christmas Hill is accessible via a somewhat hidden path across Mackenzie  Ave., which winds its way beside a private school until it reaches the Hill itself.  Excellent maps mark the way on the hill, which is approx 120 metres high.  A great relaxing walk.  This trail is also accessible from the Galloping Goose regional trail.",
    "directions": "Coming into Victoria on Highway 17, take the Mackenzie Ave. exit and head east (towards UVic).  Take the next possible right, and head to the end of that road, then turn left.  Signs then appear to guide you to the Nature House.",
