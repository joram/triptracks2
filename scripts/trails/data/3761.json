    "description": "A series of switchbacks lead to the summit ridge of Sulphur Mountain and the upper terminal of the Sulphur Mountain Gondola (5.4km).  From the upper terminal a boardwalk leads along the ridge to the Cosmic Ray Station, the true summit of Sullphur Mountain (additional 0.6km).  In winter the gondola ride down the mountain is free.  Elevation is 1561m at the parking lot, 2265m at the upper gondola terminal, and 2300m at Cosmic Ray Station.",
    "directions": "Short directions for those familiar with Banff: The trail begins from the Upper Hot Springs parking lot (not the Gondola parking lot).Long directions for those not familiar with Banff:  Follow Banff Avenue through town and across the Bow River Bridge.  At the 'T' intersection after the bridge, turn left.  After a few hundred metres around a bend is a fork in the road to the right.  Bear right onto Mountain Avenue.  After about 5 minutes you?ll see the Rimrock Hotel on your left.  Keep going for about one hundred metres bearing right until you come to a small traffic circle which is in front of the parking lot of the Banff Upper Hot Springs.  The trail begins from the Upper Hot Springs parking lot (not the Gondola parking lot).",
