    "description": "This short 20 min hike to the top of Little Saanich Mountain will have an elevation gain of ~100m. The trail is very clear and in great condition. My track terminates at a Garry Oak restoration program sign but you can easily follow the road or pathways up to the observatory and museum which will be easily in view.",
    "directions": "Go along West Saanich Road and turn onto Observatory Road. You will see 150m warning signs coming in both directions. Park in the parking lot by the chain link gate. On the north side of the road, you will see the trailhead beside the end of a chain link fence. The trail is very clear from there. Track recorded from a Garmin eTrex Venture HC.",
