    "description": "NTS Map: 082O04Summit: 2540mElevation Gain: 993 m (3,255 ft) to cliff band on first peak. 1579 m ( 5,170 ft) to summit.Although this is classified as an easy, non-technical climb or scramble it is a steep and strenuous hike to the 8495 foot summit of Mt. Rundle.  Over a distance of 6.5 km you will gain almost 900 m in elevation. Be prepared for cold, windy conditions as you climb higher.  Be prepared to stop and descend immediately if there is any sign of severe weather.  We have experienced lightning, hail, and heavy rain in summer thunder cells that had started mudslides on the switchbacks.   Parks Canada provides a detailed route description in Climber's Guide to Mount Rundle.  Pick one up at the Banff information center and review the tips, recommendations and gear lists.  You can also refer to Alan Kane's ?Scrambles in the Canadian Rockies?The GPS file has the waypoints for the Rundle trailhead junction on the Spray River trail and the summit, and the track is a two way track between the two points.",
    "directions": "Parking for the Spray River trailhead is located near the Spray River bridge on the road to the Banff Springs Golf Course.  Cross the bridge and follow the paved road just past the first fairway to the start of the trail.  Follow a fire road for about 300m to the Mt Rundle Trail junction.",
