    "description": "Upper Ellison Park is so full of trails you can spend half a day hiking them. This route takes you up the South of center then to the North, across the top and down the South outside. The first 700 meters is a climb but, once at the upper plateau it becomes an easy rolling trail. The trail on the outside is a rapid decent back to the parking area. There are some open areas but, most of the trail is in the trees which cuts any winds you may experience in the lower area.",
    "directions": "Driving south on OK Landing Road, continue out to just before the entrance to Ellison Park's campground. About 200 meters before the campground entrance, there is a gravel parking area on the left. There is a yellow barricade which is just about always left open. Park and on the right you will see a trail. \r\rFollow that for about 25 meters and on your right you will see a trail. Take that trail and follow it for about 200 meters and then follow the trail on the left. The trail to the right is the one you will return on. This trail has a steady climb for about 700 meters then levels out. Cross the old skid and continue on. The trail ends up back on an old skid road for about 30 meters then branches to the right. This is the upper trail. There are a few branches off of this and it is hard to give directions at each but, if you have a GPS to down load the file to, it is pretty clear. If you don't it is hard to get lost in the park, just continue in a downward direction. The pictures show each branch in the trail.\r\rWarning: There is an older gentleman that hikes this area nude. Loves hiking, hates clothes but is safe and friendly.",
