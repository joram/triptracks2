    "description": "This is a super easy hike/walk in an area just outside of Elphinstone Provincial Park. A conservation group has built this trail to promote their efforts to get the park expanded to include this area of the forest. (http://www.loggingfocus.org)The trail is well marked and signed and goes perpendicular to the incline of the land. This trail is strictly for hiking, but there are many downhill mountain biking trails and single track and jumps that cross it, so keep an eye out for bikers and don't stand under jumps!",
    "directions": "From the highway, head up Largo Road. It turns into gravel after about a km. At 2.7 km you will find a pull-out. Park and head up the rocky de-commissioned logging road across from you. The trailhead is well marked on your left hand side.",
