    "description": "This is a short hike to see a waterfall on a brook you wouldn?t consider looking at twice since from the road there it?s is nothing special to look at.  The fall is about 20 feet and flows though a narrow canyon.\r\rHead into the woods to the right of the stream (facing downstream).  The forest by the side of the road is composed of alders then becomes more dominated by evergreen near the fall.  Get to the top of the bank of the river because you need to get around the falls themselves.  Once you have gone around the falls, you will be at the top of a very steep bank that you navigate down to be at the base of the fall.\r\rThe trip time to see this fall is about 10 minutes (return) and is a good place to visit when you are in the area looking at other trails (Rogart Mtn loop) or other falls (Fourmile Bk, Drysdale Falls, McKay Mills Falls etc).\r",
    "directions": "Highway 246 towards West New Annan.  Turn right on Warwick Mtn Rd and drive past the Old Debert Rd.  Park by the bridge over the stream past the Old Debert Rd and walk downstream.",
