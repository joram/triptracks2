    "description": "There are two routes to follow in this area, the shorter one is about 1.5k, starting at the bridge at the top of the falls on the Onaping River.  The welcome centre is closed in the winter although there is some parking at the gate and you can walk in and follow the trail upstream to the bridge. The trail is also accessible from the top of the toboggan hill just north of the centre.  The highway shoulder is extra wide to accomodate parking.  The falls are mostly frozen over in the winter, with some fast moving open spots.  Even a few holes where the water occasionally sprays up out of the ice.  Neat to watch but it takes quick reflexes to catch it on film.\r\n   The short loop follows the red and white markings through the mixed forest and loops back down to the falls.  The longer trail isn't as well marked and is easier to follow in the summer when the path is visible on the ground.",
    "directions": "Take hwy. 144 north out of Sudbury.  The welcome centre is about 2 min. past the town of Dowling.",
