    "description": "From the start of the trail, it is a pretty steady firm up hill push.At about half way there is a choice of going up some pretty steep rock along a ridge, or go around the side (to the right). I ended up going around, which had some scree, but it seemed to be less exposed. Shortly after where the paths unite, there is a bench. After the bench, there is some exposed scrambling, which is followed by a fairly steep grade to the top. Once atop it was following the ridge for a minute or two.When I did this in May, there was some snow at the bottom with about 20 inches at the top. On the upper portions some of the rocks were ice covered which was covered by snow.NOTE: This trail was formerly rated as moderate, we've changed it to difficult based on user reviews / questions, and, route finding.",
    "directions": "From highway #1, 13 km south on highway 40. there is a small stream with some space along the roadside for a few cars. The trail head is immediately visible from the parking location.",
