    "description": "There has been some extensive trail building going on here at Klondike since last I was here (2 years back).  No longer just Klondike Bluffs and Baby Steps, there is now a loop named for Baby Steps including Baby Steps North and options Mega Steps and Little Salty.  Also EKG and Dino-Flow.  THANK YOU to all those hard working trail builders (I've done it up here & it's a ton 'o work.)\nI found Dino-Flow to be not that Flowey, it had a ton 'o sand and was tough sledding.  I wish I had tried EKG on the way back.  Little Salty and Baby Steps Loop had some pretty cool technical riding.  The scenery throughout as usual is nearly out-of-this-worldly.\nThese new trails open up a buncha new options and were some good ridin'.  Just watch for the cows on the NorthEast side of Baby Steps Loop.\nSomething you don't see that often are mine shafts disappearing down into the earth.  There is also some other old relics from the mining past.  And a view of Cnayonlands Field Arport.\nGPS data includes a few more of the trails and some crossings of the new trails I didn't get to ride this time.",
    "directions": "Same as usual, about 20km North of Moab, then 4km East on the very rough road.  Good parking and signed trailhead.",
