    "description": "This is a short boardwalk along the shore of Vaseux Lake.  It takes less than an hour.  The trail finishes at a wildlife viewing platform.  There is tons of poison ivy on this trail, so be careful.  A great spot for picnic and stretching too.",
    "directions": "The trail head is on highway 97 between Oliver and Okanagan Falls.  There is a campground between the highway and the lake.  The hiking trailhead and parking is just north of the campground.",
