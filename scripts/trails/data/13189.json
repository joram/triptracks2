    "description": "I left my car where the Sheddley Rd became more of an ATV trail.  I followed it for a while until my GPS pointed me to a fall on Horse Brook (N45.25277\u00b0 W64.42343\u00b0).  The bushwack is easy with well spaced trees.  Funny sidebar is that I made it to within 200m of this fall but turned around about ten years ago.  I was snowshoeing for about 8km to get to this point and decided that whatever falls could be on this brook were the tiny ones I had seen already.  Big mistake, the biggest fall was just ahead!  That?s a general lesson in waterfall hunting.  You just never know if a bigger fall is just ahead!Came back to Sheddley Rd ATV track and followed it towards Sheddley Cove.  At one point, I could hear the humming of a fall and turned to the left and cut across about 200ft of forest.  There at the bottom of a small ravine was a two tier fall of about 25ft in total at; N45.25430 W64.43366.  I hiked out the rest of the brook to the cove and returned to my car via the ATV track.",
    "directions": "Highway 358 towards Scots Bay.  Turn left on Sheddley Rd and go past the house and farm.  The road is public (I asked a local) although it doesn?t appear to be.  Drive as much as you want or as much as your car can take.",
