    "description": "The first part of this trail is on a logging road which at the time I was there had a locked gate at the starting point.  After a while (about 1.2mile) you turn onto some ATV trails (good for MTB) and head towards the falls on the Sackville river.  \nThe falls are located upstream of a point where the river flows underneath power lines.  I usually wouldn't bother with some of these small waterfalls, but these are fairly close to the city and easy to reach with children.  The falls are in a shaded area composed of deciduous trees but all around the brook are areas that have been logged.  The stream downstream of the falls looks wide and deep enough for a canoe and this might be another way to access this area.  There are a lot of ATV trails in this area that might be good for MTN biking but I did not have the chance to explore yet.",
    "directions": "Highway 101 to exit (Beaverbank connector Rd, Highway 354).  Continue on 354 until Middle Beaverbank and turn left on Chesapeake Rd.  Park at end of the road by the gate",
