    "description": "Nescafe is an old trail, built by Burke's foremost trail builder, an old guy named Vic.  The trail flows well, and has a few steep parts, but overall it is not very difficult.  Leave the big rig at home, you can tackle this one on your hardtail.  This trail is rarely ridden, so don't get lost.",
    "directions": "This trail starts on an old logging road that can be accessed by one of two routes:  Start up the main logging road on Burke.  Take the first left.  After a few minutes, this road forks again, and this time you go right.  You will come out at some powerlines, where the road forks again.  Don't go up or down, but rather straight ahead back into the forest.  Keep climbing another 20 minutes until you see the trail on your left (not the first trail, as this is Vic's).\r\n\r\nRoute 2:  Follow the directions to get to another trail called Bean.  Bean is above Nescafe, and flows into it.",
