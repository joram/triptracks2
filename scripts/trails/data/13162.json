    "description": "This is a cool new addition for falls on the eastern shore.  It's location was shared to me by Christopher Sinclair; Thanks!   A short bushwack of about 300m leads you to the hidden brook and fall.  If you aim just right you should come right to the 30ft fall.  The rocks are really square looking on one side of the stream and it has a gorge like feeling at the base of the fall.",
