    "description": "This is a loop that goes along QuidiVidi Lake, all the way down to the micro-brewery. From here, it heads to Signal Hill, following the top of the rocky coast. That's by far the best spot to watch the city of St-John's, if you are not distracted by the icebergs or whales around June-July.  I rated this trail as 'easy' because it is mainly a urban trail despite the Cuckold Cove part (half of the loop). Don't expect to be completely cut off from civilisation.\nPoints of interest:\n- QuidiVidi Harbour and its brewery. A seal was playing in the tiny harbour when I did that trail,- The view from Cuckold Head (add 1 km if you decide to go there),- Signal Hill and Cabot Tower. Great view of the city on one side, of Cape Spear (the most Eastern point of North-America) on the other side,- Whale watching from end of June to August,- Iceberg watching in June.\n There is GPS data attached to this trail (see \"download GPS\"), which if loaded into your GPS can help you find route points.",
    "directions": "I recommend that you start at the lake's end close to the Old Stadium.\nTo find the trail, just locate the lake. Parking is not a problem along the lake (or on Signal Hill if you decide to start here).\nThis trail can easily be combined with the 'Battery - Signal Hill' Trail.",
