    "description": "This hike goes up the backside of Mt. Finlayson, as opposed to the \"front side\" at Goldstream Park. It is longer, so less steep. The trail is a switch back through the forest, so there are still steep sections but it is not as sketchy as the rock scramble on the frontside, so fine to do in the rain. It's also probably a bit less busy, as not as many people know about it.",
    "directions": "From the #1 Hwy, head North on Millstream Road. Turn left onto Finlayson Arm Road. The Trailhead is about 100 feet AFTER Rowntree Road, on the left. There is a sign but it's hard to see. Park on the side of the road, there isn't much of a pullout.",
