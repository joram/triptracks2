    "description": "A beautiful paddle down a pristine estuary.  Lots of wildlife, lots of shoreline.  This body of water is drastically affected by the tide.  There is literally not enough water in some places at low tide, you can be left high and dry.  However, be careful not to run against the tide for the duration of your paddle unless you want a solid work out.  There is an easy access boat launch at the Northern end of the navigable part of the river.  You can paddle all the way down to the Rhode Island Sound or up into the East Branch.  Round trip to the sound and back is 8 miles and there is plenty to see down at the mouth so plan on doing a little exploring down there.  Only experience and equipped sea kayakers should venture beyond the inlet as it is completely open water beyond the point.",
    "directions": "The launch is right on the Rhode Island - Massachusettes border.  Westport Harbor Road is a Southerly turn off Main St. in Adamsville.  The launch is less than 1/2 mile down this road.",
