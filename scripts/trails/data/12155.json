    "description": "Deep in the woods lies a mostly unknown occurrence for SW nova Scotia; some waterfalls!   There are some falls on either side of the logging road.  The upstream falls can be reached by following an ATV trail for about 1km.   The fall itself is not very spectacular.  I was a bit discouraged but decided to walk downstream from the road....and sure enough there was some bigger falls there.  the walk was not on a path but easy nonetheless as the tall evergreens overshadow most of the forest floor preventing the secondary growth of brush.",
