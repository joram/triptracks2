    "description": "Seven km hike from highway 16 uphill to the first camp site.  A further seven km to the top camp site.  Several day trips can be done from the top.  The trail follows the pipeline right of way for the first half mile and then the trail head appears on your left with a sign up sheet.  \nThe first 10 km of trail are well defined, but the trail becomes less defined when you start hiking on loose rocks and large boulders.  There are signs every 500m or so from here on in.\nThe lower camp sites have several pads with a bear pole and composting toilet.  The upper camp site lacks in amenities.",
    "directions": "Trail head is off highway 16 between Jasper, Alberta and Tete Jaune Cache, BC.  Park in the Yellowhead Lake parking lot, near the Alberta border.  Cross the highway and follow the pipeline right of way to the west about 700m to the trail head.",
