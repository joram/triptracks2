    "description": "This is an easy trail to hike but it is rated average because of the length. For the most part it follows along the lakeshore with a few minor diversions through the bush. Nice views of the lake and Kananaskis Falls and Sarrail Falls. While you're there take some time and feed the whiskeyjacks.NTS Map: 082J11Elevation Gain: 60 m (197 ft).",
    "directions": "Park at the interlakes parking area in Peter Lougheed Provincial Park and follow the trail in either direction. Other trails branch out from this one, just stay near the lakeshore.",
