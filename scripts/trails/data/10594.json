    "description": "Trail is relatively flat. A few small climbs and fun little up and downs but overall little elevation change. Trail is very well marked and broken in from high mountainbiking trafic. The trail is often busy with hikers and bikers during peak times, especially weekend. The full Desert Classic trail is approximately 9 miles out and 9 miles back and can be a good cardio workout. The trail included in the GPS is only a portion of the full trail which makes for an hour ride, and they are building additional trails west so you could make this easily into a 30 mile out and back.Best nearby bike Shop, Curbside Cyclery on S Warner Elliott not too far away (from the 10).  Mike is a great mechanic.",
    "directions": "Take Elliott off the 10 and go north on 48th until it bears right toward baseline. Go left at this point then take another quick left (thnik its Pima Canyon Road) toward a small gaurd tower (don't need to stop) and park anywhere on the side or at the end is a small parking lot. Desert Classic trail is to the left of the parking/picnic area.",
