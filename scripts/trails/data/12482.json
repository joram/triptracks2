    "description": "Hike to the Olive Hut atop the Catamount Glacier at 9000'. Travel up a creek bed, through a marsh and up the marked trail. There is a difficult scramble over some large boulders before the glacier. The route onto the glacier will change as years pass. Bring a guide with glacier experience and appropriate gear. Phenomenal views throughout the entire trip and lots of territory to explore once arriving at the hut.",
    "directions": "From Radium, head west on the Horsethief Forestry road for 13.6 km. Turn right on Forster Service road and drive to the trailhead at the end at 42km. The road conditions vary and AWD is recommended (and sometimes essential). Cross the bridge over the river, through the valley until you come to the rocky spines on your left where the trail will start. 4-6 hours from bridge to hut.",
