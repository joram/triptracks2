    "description": "McGillivray Ridge is a nice, short hike to a ridge with great views of Crowsnest Mountain and the surrounding peaks of the Crowsnest Pass and into B.C. Follow the trail a short distance to a cut line and turn right. At the top of the hill turn left and head uphill. The trail gets quite steep at this point, but only for about 400m. Near the top of this steep part, watch for a switchback on your left. Take this and then swing back around (right) to meet the trail. Follow the trail straight ahead to the TransAlta service road and follow the road up to the Transmitter station.Enjoy the views for a while, then head up to the ridge proper. Follow the ridge as far as you like, then return the way you came.NTS Map: 082G10Elevation gain -590 m (1,935 ft).",
    "directions": "Take the Kananaskis Road north from Coleman in the Crowsnest Pass. There are KM markers visible on the side of the road. The trailhead is a little inconspcuous, but it is at exactly 6.4km, heading north, on the west side of the road. Park on the road, it's wide enough.",
