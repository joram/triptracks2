    "description": "Located a few minutes drive north of Sechelt on Redrooffs Road, the 57-hectare Sargeant Bay Provincial Park provides a  network of hiking and mountain biking trails through forested uplands and along rocky headlands.  The Triangle Lake Hiking Trail originates in the park's parking area and winds for 3.5 km along Colvin Creek, through an alder grove and up to Triangle Lake.  The mountain biking trails cover more than 15 km and provide unexpected single-track enjoyment in this little known park.\r\r",
    "directions": "Sargeant Bay Provincial Park is located near Sechelt on British Columbia's Sunshine Coast, and is accessed on Redrooffs road off Highway 101, between Sechelt and Halfmoon Bay.  Easy parking.",
