    "description": "Completed August 15, 2017Despite smoky conditions, this circuit provided amazing views of Mount Temple and surrounding peaks. We chose the approach from the Temple Lake side which is steeper than the Lake Annette side. There was still a lot of avalanche debris near Temple Lake, but also plenty of wildflowers. The trail down to Lake Annette is not very clear, but is exactly between the trees and the talus slope off Mount Temple.",
    "directions": "Trailhead is in the Paradise Creek parking lot, 3 km up the Moraine Lake access road.",
