    "description": "When the winds are too strong to paddle, or you just want to stretch your legs, this is a great way to take a peek up Salmon Inlet. This trail starts as a 100m grind up an old skidder road. Continue the same direction when entering the clear patch. It then connects with an old logging road that is growing over and head left (north). Watch for bears along the route, as you will see lots of scat along the way. Bring water as this route does not cross any significant water sources. The trail ends at a log booming area at Nine Mile Point and the mouth of Salmon Inlet.",
    "directions": "At the back of Nine Mile Point Camp, head up the hill on the left side of the river.",
