    "description": "The gate was closed when we arrived, just before dusk.  So we walked the short distance into the parking area provided.  You can hear the roar of the falls on your way in. Keep dogs leashed when you get to the parking area as these falls are steep.  Beautiful spot!",
    "directions": "from Highway 103 take exit 11, then turn right onto route 324 towards Newburne. You will drive past @ churches and a community hall.  On the left there will be a sign indicating the falls.  Drive down this road until you come to a three way intersection, take the left unless the gate is closed.  then park on the right and walk in on the left.",
