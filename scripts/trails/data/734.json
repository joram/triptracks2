    "description": "A bit concealed, the top of Mount Vicars offers nice views over the Thompson Valley, including Mt. Peter and Mt. Paul and Scuitto Lake. If you come in late spring or early summer, a myriad of wildflowers will await you: lupines, penstemons, balsam root, and lady slippers are some of the examples. The hike is a gradual ascent of about 1 hour to the top of Mount Vicars. From the parking area, go north for about 300 meters and pick up the trail on the left of the road as it curves. After \u00bd hour of hiking, the trail turns west, going parallel to the hill. Leave the trail at this point and go on through several small clearings for about another \u00bd hour. To reach the top, go over some boulders and rock outcroppings. For the return, retrace your ascent route.",
    "directions": "From Kamloops, drive east on Hwy. #1 (Trans Canada Hwy.). Turn south (right) onto the Barnhart Vale Road. Pass through the community of Barnhartvale and then turn right (south) onto Robbins Range Road. This road will lose its surface soon (after about 0.5 km). Follow this road to where it forks, where you take the right. Continue uphill to the Squitto Lake Forest Road. Turn right, and continue for another 9.5 km. At the fork near the lake, take the left fork and follow it for about 1 km. Park your car at the open field. Note, that there?s a dirt road leading down to the lake. Access to the lakeshore is provided by private landholders, so ask for permission beforehand.",
