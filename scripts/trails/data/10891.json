    "directions": "This is the GPS data to get you from branch 200 on upper Squamish valley road.Google yourself to 70002 Squamish Valley Rd  Brackendale, BC V0N 1H0 ( and have breakfast if it's an early morning start). Turning left at the Cheekeye river bridge follow the road up the Squamish valley for 17 kilometers until you reach the gravel.  Follow the GPS track (downloadable) to branch 200 and drive as high as you can. We do this trip a dozen times a year in the winter and is fairly easy going. I hear it is quite bushy in the summer !",
