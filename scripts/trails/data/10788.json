    "description": "A short hiking trail is tucked away in the far corner of Smiley?s provincial Park.  With the closing of the provincial park gate in autumn, the hike is extended by 2km since you now have to cross the camping section to access the trail.The trail itself is mostly hard packed gravel and has slight elevation changes as it meanders through an evergreen forest.  To get to the start of the trail, you will walk through a towering  tunnel of maple trees (near the children?s play park)  as well as by a good example of a gypsum outcrop with a gnarly pine growing right over it.",
    "directions": "Highway 14, turn right on Ashdale Rd and then immediate right on Clayton McKay Rd. Then right at the entrance to the provincial park",
