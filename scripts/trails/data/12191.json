    "description": "The South March Highlands are a network of trails maintained by the Ottawa Mountain Biking Association, but frequently used for hiking, walking, fatbiking, mountain biking and snowshoeing.  OMBA has done a great job maintaining the bike trails, but in doing so, they have made the trails much more technical than the average rider might expect.",
    "directions": "There are several trailheads along Second Line Road at the intersections of Klondike, Brady and others.",
