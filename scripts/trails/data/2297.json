    "description": "This little ditty was found after a lack-luster ice climb visit over in Halifax.This was a small little training-worthy bit of waterfall ice that exists right off the old highway near Wentworth. Call it Higgen's falls?Probably around 25-30 feet high, the two tier waterfall had formed enough ice to give it a go, when everywhere else had no ice to offer.The wonderful thing about this little gem is that at the top exists a deep straight tunnel which has the water source flowing through it. It tunnels beneath the railway line.Also at the top lies very secure anchor points in the form of healthy trees. I rate this ice climb a WI 2- probably. When it fattens up, it may have more to offer in terms of lines and ranges of difficulty. All in all, a great visit!",
    "directions": "On the old TCH, now route 13 from Truro, through Wentworth Valley (where the ski hill is)Find the Wentworth Valley Hotel, and work back a couple hundred meters and look for a wide logging path on the same side of the road. Probably marked with a post.",
