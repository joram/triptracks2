    "description": "This \"trail\" is the Cheakamus Lake access-road that is normally closed during the winter and early spring due to snow. This closure makes the road good for some x-c skiing and snowshoeing. When I was there, we (me and my parents)hardly saw anyone recreating on the \"trail.\" For someone who likes off-the-beaten-path trails, the Cheakamus Lake access road during the winter and early-spring months is a good choice!\r\n\r\nThis trail is generally flat puncuated by some hills. We ended our hike in a wide spot in the road (possibly a parking lot) with three blue directional signs placed around it.",
    "directions": "From Whislter Village, travel south on the Sea to Sky Highway--looking of signs indicating where the Cheakamus Lake turnoff is-- until you reach Function Junction. From there, its self explanitory.",
