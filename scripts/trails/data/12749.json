    "description": "According to the Maxwell Provincial Park's signposts, this trail is called the \"Girlfriend Route.\" It begins in Burgoyne Bay and winds through some hillside meadows and cuts beneath the Baynes Cliffs before circling onto the summit. The final viewpoints offer fantastic views of the Southern Gulf islands, the Sansum narrows, Bruce Peak, and Fulford Valley.",
    "directions": "The trail head is adjacent to the Burgoyne Bay upper parking lot. You'll find a signpost-map near a yellow utility gate which marks the route's beginning.  *This hike is near Ganges, Saltspring Island. Unfortunately, TP does not list this community. (editors'note: we will add as soon as we can, thanks for adding).",
