    "description": "Nice trail in the shade of the woods. Lots of spiderwebs, some of them with spiders. Trail ends in a rocky noll. After that, there is the Williams Peak, very beautiful, but non convenient go up there without climbing gear and climbing experience.",
    "directions": "After Chilliwack, go to Chilliwack Lake Road. The entrance to the path is on the left (N49 06.133 W121 32.887). Cross the woods up to the service road for logging, go left on it and after 20 meters go right to find the path to go up to the ridge, very steep from the beginning.",
