    "description": "A last in a series of hikes in the branches of North River.  From the satellite imagery a particular spot on the river looked good as a potential waterfall site.  We set off from the car and soon hit a tributary.  I thought this tributary had some potential for waterfalls too but it was a dud.  We followed it downstream to the Middle Branch.  Then a quick upstream hike led us by some smaller cascade type falls surrounded by large boulders.  We ended the hike at the largest of these falls.   If you bypass the tributary its a short hike to some very seldom visited falls.   This is a side excursion if you have already seen the West Branch north river falls and the tributary to middle Branch North river falls.",
