    "description": "This trail was build by Paul Jenkins, the land owner, on land owned by the family. One loop is well developed, while the other is more of a concept trail that needs traffic to break it in.  *this happened during a recent October DownEaster mtn bike race)\nThe single track offers few views (red loop has old abandoned cars), but is a nice option for this area of the province. In the fall, the color contrast between the trail and the greenery was breathtaking.\nI marked this moderate, but because of the lack of trail development, it is a hard slog in traveling through the moss. Blue and red ribbons define the routes. The Red route is easier and flowy, while the blue trail with its bridges and wheel traps is the more difficult.\nhttp://becktrail.com\nShannon Burt\nEast Coast editor",
