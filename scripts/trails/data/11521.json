    "description": "Although there is two trails in the area to the Lakes, I will only talk about the Vermillion Lakes trail. This is a very easy trail super close to Banff.   So easy, I saw a couple with a baby stroller.  It would be a nice one to bring granny on.  Wonderful scenery and wildlife.  I saw tons of waterbirds, deer, and a rabbit.  There are tons of photo opportunities here.  We took a picnic lunch and ate by the 2nd lake.",
    "directions": "From downtown in Banff take Mount Norquay Rd north towards Hwy 1.  The trailhead for the Fenland Trail is at a parking area to the left on Mt. Norquay Rd just prior to Hwy 1.  Also there is the Vermillion Lakes trail: to get to the trail head, continue past the Fenland Trail parking area a short distance and turn left on Vermillion Lakes Dr.  there is a parking area here.",
