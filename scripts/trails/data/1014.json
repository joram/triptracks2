    "description": "Easy access to get you into the San Juan Islands.  Great views of the islands, Cascade Mountain Peaks and Olympic Mountains.  Relative easy two day trip or long one day.  Three opportunities for overnight camping approximately equally spaced around the island makes it easy to coordinate the trip with the currents.  Camping at tiny Strawberry Island on the west side of Cypress is my favorite.  Pelican Beach on the North and Cypress Head on the Southeast side are also good stops and would be great for overnight.  The rip currents off Cypress head are impressive to watch from the overview at the campground.  The rips are easy to avoid when paddling.  Best place to launch is the Guemes Ferry landing in Anacortes.  Alternate launch is Washington Park near the San Juan Island Ferry terminal.",
    "directions": "Guemes Ferry Landing is on the north side of Anacortes Washington at the intersection of I St. and 6th St. on the Guemes channel directly across from Guemes Island.  The San Juan Ferry Terminal is about 3 miles west of town and all the highway signs lead to it. Washington Park is just west of the San Juan Ferry terminal and well signed.",
