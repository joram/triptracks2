    "description": "This is a difficult trail but well worth the reward.  This hike is basically an add-on to the Rainbow Lake Trail. It is rather difficult and goes outside of the park area of Rainbow Lake. When you reach the peak, you look right down on the lake, and you can see down the valley between Sproat and Rainbow.  And you can see the Mountains around the Callaghan Valley as well. I hiked it two summers ago and there were patches of snow.\nRound trip from Whistler Valley is about 25km and 1700m elevation gain.",
    "directions": "First get to whistler, and then go up the Rainbow Lake Trail. When you reach the lake, follow the trail that goes around to the other side of the lake and down into Hanging Lake.  However, don?t go down into Hanging Lake. Before the trail turns left, look closely for a narrow trail that goes to the right. Eventually this trail will dissipate into the surrounding vegetation and you are on your own.  The peak will now be to your right. Just keep on going up. The views at the top are unbelievable.",
