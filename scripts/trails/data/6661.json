    "description": "This hike will take you along the Bay of Fundy coastline in an area that is lined by 100-200 foot cliffs and two waterfalls. Go down the dirt road by foot as it follows the brook on your left hand side. The path is wide and probably used by ATVs from time to time. At the end of the road you come out to the Bay of Fundy in an area that looks like it is used for camping/bonfires. The area is quite flat to set up a tent and you have a small 6 foot waterfall flowing into the ocean just beside you. Turn to the right and follow the high cliffs for about 800m to a 25-30 foot high waterfall. The cliffs are huge above your head and in one spot there has been a massive rock slide in the past which has left at least one good size boulder. The cliffs are a kind of orange/pink in color?quite scenic. Across the water you will notice, Cape Chignecto off in the distance as well as Cape D?Or and Ile Haute.",
    "directions": "Take highway 101 to Exit 15 and turn right on highway 360\u00a0towards Harbourville. Continue on this road as it climbs the north Mountains. Turn right on Russia Rd and drive about 700m. You should see a dirt road on your right just pass a brook. Park here and take the dirt road down to the beach?",
