    "description": "A great trail to just get out and ride. A simple loop that provides a good workout \rbut doesn't tire you for the rest of the day. Watch out for boggy areas and thick \rdeep mud in a couple of spots. There a few fences/gates along the way. Some \ryou can get around or just take the time to unhook and ride thru. I rode this \rclockwise and my max speed was about 46 km/hr on the downhills. Easy \rdownhills with loose rocks in one or two sections. No photo op's on this one. \rJust a fun trail to ride with friends.",
    "directions": "Highway 22 west from Calgary, turn right on 22 towards Bragg Creek. Hwy 22 \rbecomes Hwy 66 if you don't turn. At the 4 way stop continue straight thru \rBragg Crk. The mall should be on your left. Cross the bridge and turn left on \rWest Bragg Creek Rd. This road will take you right into the parking lot. You may \rbe able to ride up the road from the parking lot and avoid the boggy section at \rthe beginning. You just need to watch for the trail on your right.",
