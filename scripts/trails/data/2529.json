    "description": "Time and distance are return, elevation gain is 1,200'.The trail to the Snowshoe cabin, an abandoned ranger station, follows the abandoned fire road to that station. This is a very easy trail that anyone can do, the elevation gain is not even noticeable. The fact that it is double-track for most of the way makes it ideal for larger groups, allowing for side by side hiking. This is also one of only three official biking trails in the park.The trail starts at the Red Rock Canyon parking area, at the end of the Red Rock Parkway. Cross the bridge near the washrooms and head west. The trail follows the Bauerman Creek Valley and accesses the more remote areas of Waterton National Park. At 4.6km you will come to the junction of the Goat Lake Trail.  Another 3.9km of gentle uphill brings you to theSnowshoe cabin/campground. Although this is a rather unexciting destination in itself, this is a major trail junction, intersecting with trails to Lost Lake, Castle River Divide, Twin Lakes (c/g), Blue Grouse Basin and Avion Ridge.",
