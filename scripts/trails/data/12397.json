    "description": "Not much of a hike since a logging road was built right to it but its a nice place for a mountain bike ride on the way to the abandoned settlement of New France aka Electric city.The logging road comes to approx 100m from the balancing rock which could with a good cleaning be used for some awesome bouldering.",
    "directions": "Highway 340.  Turn on Langford Road and stay on it to a secondary road on your left N44.31859 W65.82767.  the rock is approx at N44.33283 W65.78749.  Look for some flagging tape and a path on your right.",
