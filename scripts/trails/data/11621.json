    "description": "This is a cool hidden gem.  Near highway 4 you leave your car at a guard rail and enter the leafy forest.  Follow the brook upstream and soon you will notice giant blocks of rocks and after a bend or two you will face a large man made tunnel.  A railroad passes overhead and from looking at the tunnel from both sides, it appears they filled in the natural channel and punched through the rocky mountain.  The upstream side is worth a look as well as you can see the remnant of the river which carved out a mini cave-like opening.  The upstream side is also carved out without a ceiling so be careful near the opening as it is a sharp 15ft drop to a shallow stream.  I ended up soaking my boots but was able to travel the whole lenght of the tunnel.  The whole thing might take less than an hour to visit and is good for any age (as long as it hasn't rained lately).",
    "directions": "Highway 4.  turn on Base Line Rd and park at the bridge over Tunnel Brook...walk upstream!",
