    "description": "When i hiked Mt Sproatt was in April 2016. The trail shares with Rainbow lake trail half way, and after pit toilet, we turned left and started bushwacking for 40-60 mins. After that, we were above tree line and the view started to be gorgeous.  Another hour of snow hike with shoe shoes on, we were on top of Mt Sproatt.  Beautiful panoramic view to Whistler and Blackcomb to the left, cat skiing meadow on right and Rainbow Mt behind.gps recommended.",
    "directions": "The trailhead is the same as Rainbow Lake trail.",
