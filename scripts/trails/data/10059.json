    "description": "A relatively easy hike with a pack with beautiful lake scenery with mountains as a backdrop. You will travel 2-2.5 km, where you reach the Mt. Indefatigable rock slide and the trail cuts northward up and over the the slide. This is followed by a nice easy hike into the Point Campground at 3.5 km. Site 19 is secluded on the other end and overlooks the lake.",
    "directions": "Park at the interlakes parking area in Peter Lougheed Provincial Park and follow the trail across the dam to the north (right) below Mt. Indefatigable. Other trails branch out from this one, just stay near the lakeshore.",
