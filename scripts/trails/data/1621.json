    "description": "NTS Map: 082H04Note - time and distance are one way. Moderately difficult. elevation gain - 460 m (1,500 ft). This is a continuation of the  Bertha Falls Trail. After crossing the bridge at Bertha Falls, the trail steepens immediately, following a series of switchbacks as it climbs up the avalanche slopes of Mt. Richards. On the way you are graced with a nice view of Upper Bertha Falls, a bridal veil type of braided waterfall. Especially impressive early in the season.The lake sits in a high alpine cirque surrounded by Mt. Richards (left), Mt. Alderson (ahead) and Bertha Peak (right). There is a picnic area and a trail which runs around the entire lake shore.Return the way you came. In winter please check local avalanche conditions.",
    "directions": "Trailhead is well marked, on Evergreen St. in Waterton townsite, about 500m past Cameron Falls, across from serviced camping area.",
