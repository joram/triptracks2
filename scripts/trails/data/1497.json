    "description": "Originally created as a 4x4 trail, it has fallen into disuse and is open for anybody to enjoy.  Starts east of Flanders Lake, and ends at Marijane Lake (with a nice campsite at Whitlock Lake at the halfway point for overnighters).  The trail is a bit hard to follow, since it was confined to the rocks as much as possible, but you should be able to follow the tire tracks and cairns.",
    "directions": "Get into Nopiming Provincial Park, and take highway 315 past Bird Lake.  Turn south (right) towards Flanders Lake a few klicks after the Tulabi Falls campsite.  At the end of the road is where the trail starts.",
