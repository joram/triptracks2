    "description": "NTS Map: 092G07Deep Cove is only minutes from Vancouver, yet after paddling a short distance you will feel isolated from civilization. From Deep Cove you can paddle all the way to the end of Indiam arm, a 3-4 hour paddle (the route up Indiam arm is shown above along with a mountain-bike ride that some people take all the way to Squamish).  Most people just explore the immediate area around Deep Cove, including some nearby Islands. The area is sheltered and usually calm and it's a perfect beginners paddle. You can extend the paddle all the way up Indian arm, camp, visit falls, and explore.  The longer versions are generally covered elswhere on trailpeak (use search - for Deep Cove as nearest). There's great mountain scenery, waterfalls and islands.(and unfortunately signs of logging and the Buntzen Lake power plant).  Launch from Deep Cove, on the North shore, (take the Second Narrows Bridge from Vancouver then follow the signs) or from Belcarra, 28 km east of Van.  Take Hastings Street and the Barneet Highway to Port Moody, the follow the signs to Ioco and Belcarra.Hazards:  lots of small boat traffic.  Be conspicuous, and stick to the shoreline.",
