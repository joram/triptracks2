    "description": "Crowsnest-Antler-Smallwood-Bigwood loop:Peddle from lot up Smallwood Creek FSR. Just past 3 km road marker, take a left up an old road bed. The first trail you will see on your left is a connector to Bigwood. Continue on the road bed until you reach Crowsnest trail. Take a left and begin a 2.5 km climb. Crowsnest will top out on the Garritty Connector FSR. Take a left and peddle up to the start of Antler. This will lead directly to the Smallwood trail. Take Smallwood to the lookout and then continue down taking the left onto Bigwood which will take you back to Smallwood Creek FSR just above the lot.Awesome singletrack climbing on Crowsnest. Antler is beautiful crosscountry with occasional moderate techincal sections. Smallwood trail has a decent climb again to the lookout, then Bigwood is a nice flowy descent.",
