    "description": "This is a hike through the woods to a cascading waterfall located on the East Branch of the Brierly Brook.  \r\rI had some directions to get to the fall but I either did not have enough coffee that morning or the directions weren?t cleared but it took me three different starts to reach them.  I hope my indications are clearer.  \r\rThe coordinates below should be precisely where the western branch of Brierly Brook flows underneath the road.  Make your way downstream form this point to a location where the eastern branch of the Brierly Brook meets the stream you are following.  The fall is located just upstream of this junction point.\r\rHiking to this fall is fairly easy with only a few locations where you will need to duck under or over some deadfall.  The forest is dominated by mature hardwoods which makes this a very nice place to travel through.  The brook is about 6-8 ft wide and there are lots of stone to step on when you need to cross it. \r",
    "directions": "In Antigonish, take highway 245 towards Malignant Cove.  Turn left on Clysedale Rd and then take another left Browns Mountain Rd.  Make your way all the way up the mountain.
