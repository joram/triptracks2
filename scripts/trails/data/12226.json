    "description": "A gradual climb makes this ideal for snowshoeing or backcountry skiing/split-boarding.  After a couple of kms, there is a creek crossing.  a km or so past the creek, there is the option to head to Zupjok, Llama and Alpaca Peaks to to the right, Iago directly ahead, or Ottomite to the left.  Ottomite is a short jaunt to the left.  This peak is not bare, but still offers some nice views of the surrounding mountains.  Iago is a few kms further and offers nicer views of Needle, Flatiron, Markhor and of course Nak Peak.  We took our snowboards up while on snowshoes and found some nice fluffy powder to ride back down.  Skiing would have been betters, since the terrain is more rolling hills than simple up and down.",
    "directions": "Drive East on Hwy 1 past Hope and then take Hwy 5 (the Coquihalla).  Take exit 217 to the Zopkios Rest Area (Take the tunnel under the highway).  Park near the washrooms.  The trail begins along the road just behind the washrooms and soon heads into the trees.",
