    "description": "A well marked trail up to the observatory, a good cardio of 150 m gain at the beginning. If you go beyond the smaller observatory in the back you will come across another trailhead that will loop back. There will be some nice pamaramic views onto Prospect Lake, Mt. Work, Finlayson and many others.Note: This is a duplicate listing to a trail on trailpeak with description / images / GPS -- however this GPS route has an extended loop and trails.",
    "directions": "Head up West Saanich road, turn right onto Observatory road and parking is on the right before the gate. The trailhead is to the left of the road and fence.",
