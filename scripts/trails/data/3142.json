    "description": "North Secret is the original northern section of the trail now know in full as  \"Comfortably Numb\", one of the Whistler epic single track mountain bike rides.  North Secret cuts out off Comfortably Numb just before Wedge Creek, where you take a downhill single track called \"Young Lust\" which meets up with some double track that will take you back to the trailhead.\nTechnical and flowy it has some fun tight sections, climbs up a nice set of switch-backs and over bridges to an impressive view over the valley.",
    "directions": "Ride North of Whistler to the Wedgemount turn-off (on Hwy 99). Bike up the logging road to your left, when it forks take a steep right - look for the trail head 200m up - on the right (trail head is labelled 'Comfortably Numb', North Secret is the first section of this trail before the bridge crosses over the river).",
