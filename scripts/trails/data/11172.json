    "description": "Fairly easy hike from Lac du Bois Quarry to the aircraft Beacon Hill above the city. Rolling hills with the exception of the hike up a steep road to the Beacon Hill.",
    "directions": "Take Bachelor Hills Road. Drive over the cattle guard and when the pavement ends and gravel begins, look for a road on the left. Park just in the fence. Walk up the road a bit then take the road to the right. Cross the cattle guard and continue on the road until you see another road coming down from the right. Stay to the left and then onto the trail on the left. The trail crosses the road several times and goes to the same place, but the trail is more interesting.Continue on the trail until it ends at a road. Go left on the road and at the next intersection, right and continue on up the hill to the Beacon Light. This is a steep climb, but the view is well worth it. Once you are done, backtrack to where the trail joined the road, but continue up the road.After a short hill, go right at the next intersection. Follow this road until you come to the cattle guard and then right on the trail without crossing the cattle guard. Follow this trail which will return you to the parking area.",
