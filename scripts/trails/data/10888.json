    "description": "Gin Peak is the summit immediately south of Rainbow Lake. It makes a nice day trip when approached from Whistler Olympic Park in the Callaghan Valley. There is a ski run north off the summit to Rainbow Lake. North and Northwest facing slopes going down to Hanging Lake are also excellent ski runs.",
    "directions": "Access is from Whistler Olympic Park, the cross-country skiing, biathlon and ski jumping facility in the Callaghan Valley. Whistler Olympic Park is at the far end of Callaghan Valley Road, which leaves highway 99 north of Brandywine Falls, about 20km south of Whistler. The backcountry access trails begin from the Biathlon Range Parking Lot, which is about 1km past the main Day Lodge on Callaghan Valley Road. Whistler Olympic Park normally closes in mid April, and the road is gated just after Alexander Falls. After the Olympic Park is closed, park at Alexander Falls and use the unmaintained cross-country trails to reach the backcountry access trailheads.",
