    "description": "Right on the shores along the main road is the Farrell's river. We lodged in a near by cottage rental, in preperation for Kenomee Canyon, a local back country hike.\nWith canoes on the banks, and cheap, off-season rates, we were welcome to what they had in watercraft, paddles and PFD's. We launched in a flimsy canoe that lacked a thwart, and managed none the less to paddle in the evening hours up river to explore the area.\nThe river is a calm piece that narrows as it goes upstream and under a road bridge. \nThe huge rains we were up against eventually canceled our hiking venture. I think it put a downer on the kite festival that takes place as well during the May long weekend. Kites and airfoils fill the skies in the Parsboro and Economy area, where people come as far as Maine to take part.\nIn all, it's a pretty area, and the canoe route is a pleasant aside to a neat place to stay. It's on the doorstep to some amazing hiking and kayaking in the region.\nShannon Burt\nEast Coast editor",
