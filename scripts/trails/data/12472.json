    "description": "The Cranberry Marsh or the Starratt Wildlife Management Area is a stunning nature haven ? birds, ducks, muskrats, beavers, dragonflies make their home here. There is great berry picking in late summer. You can ski or snowshoe the trail in winter. The beginning of this great trail (from the Best Western) is great for someone with limited mobility. The best part is the dyke which is located just 50 feet or so from the Best Western parking lot. From here, you can stroll along the dyke, climb the viewing tower and see the nesting islands from above, or do the entire loop which will take just under 2 hours at a moderate pace. A new boardwalk finished in December 2015 lets you get a closer look at the marsh on the eastern side.",
