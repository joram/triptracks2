    "description": "*Most Difficult* A mixture of long steep climbs, lose trail surfaces, numerous difficult obstacles to avoid or jump over, drop-offs and sharp corners. Some sections are definitely easier, but the trail is a steep climb. The summit is at 7700? and if you are height sensitive, you will have a problem with the last ascent to the summit. It is very steep and somewhat of a cliff climb.",
    "directions": "Travel east from Sicamous on Hwy 1. Watch for the rest stop on the right side of the highway. A few Km?s past that, you will see the road on the left for the Crazy Creek Forest Service Rd. Follow the road and take two right forks then a left to the trail head. From that left, you are 5km from the trail and there is a sign. Overall from the highway to the trail head is 16-17km. At the trail head there is just a wide road for parking, but an outhouse to use before heading up. 4wd or high clearance vehicle is recommended for the road off the highway as the road is rough. There is basically only one trail to the summit so it is hard to go wrong. There is a few areas you have to look ahead for a path, but there are rock markers to help.  There is a small creek about 2/3?s of the way with good cold water to refill at, on the way down if you run short. Also a good place to soak your feet if you are developing hot spots.On Sept 1, the deer and horse flies were particularly bad and no amount of Deet helped to hold them at bay. I had shorts and T-shirt and was wishing I had brought something more full sleeve and leg, but the weather was very warm. Because of the altitude you are advised to be prepared for weather changes and wind. There is little protection in the last 1/3 of the hike as you are above the tree level and wide open to the wind. I counted over 30 people on the trail despite the distance from large cities & towns.",
