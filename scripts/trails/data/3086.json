    "description": "Elevator is a short, steep trail that starts from the powerlines that intersect Triple Crown, and comes out back on the main logging road.  From the end of triple crown, cross the logging road and look for another trail that continues downward from here.  At the end of this second trail, turn right on the logging road and ride up to the fork.  Look to your left and you will find yet another trail.  This one will take you back down to your car.",
    "directions": "Route 1: Ride the first section of Triple Crown.  When you come out at the power lines, turn right on the road and begin looking for a trail on your left.\r\n\r\nRoute 2:  From the gate, ascend the main logging road, staying right at both forks.  After the second fork, the road becomes a bit crappier but is still rideable.  Continuing up, you will pass the exit of triple crown (ladder on your left), and the entrances to Divot and Galloway (on your right).  Eventually the logging road will bring you around the east side of Burke Mountain where you will get terrific views of Pitt River, Minnekhada and Pitt Meadows.  The road switchebacks up the powerlines and eventually you come to the intersection with Triple Crown (descending on your left and ascending on your right).  Soon after this, you will see the entrance to Elevator on your left.  If the road begins to descend, you have just gone too far.",
