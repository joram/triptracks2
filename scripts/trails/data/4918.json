    "description": "Heart mountain is an easy to moderate scramble located just east of Canmore, Alberta.  Its aspect makes it one of the first passable alpine trails that can be hiked in the summer. By mid June the approach to the first false peak is typically completely clear and dry. The final traverse across the top of the heart is likely to hide several knee deep snow drifts which can be refreshing on a warm day.  The east slope is more exposed to the elements than the west. Strong winds here are a force to be reckoned with.",
    "directions": "Take Highway 1 west from Calgary past Deadmans Flats to the Seebe / Exshaw exit just East of Lac Des Arcs. proceed over the overpass to the south side of the highway where you will find a parking area. From here follow the heart creek trail approximately 1km. A sign will point you towards the Heart Mountain scramble to the left of the trail.",
