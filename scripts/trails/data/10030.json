    "description": "One of the many routes to take on High Rim Trail. This is marked as being towards the end of the trail. There is many other trails that branch off of this route. The route is generally easy with a few sections that are steep.",
    "directions": "Take the road to the main gate & parking lot for the Kalamalka Lake Park. From the gate & parking lot, travel 2.9km on the gravel road to the start of the trail on the left. There are two ways to deal with this route. There is only room for one vehicle to park at this spot. You can park here or go to 3.4/3.5km marker which is the Crash of 08 trail, where you will come out at, which has room for at east 3 vehicles and walk down the road to the trail start. Unless you have someone to drop off & pick up, you will have to walk the road regardless and I suggest you park at the Crash of 08 site and walk down to the trail. You can also do the reverse of what I have shown and hike up Crash of 08 & Twisted Sister to get to the High Rim trail but, Twisted Sister is a steep & constant climb. Either way to hike it, be aware that at the upper level of the High Rim trail, it is very enclosed with trees and the temperature is considerably lower. It is advisable to dress in layers for each portion of the trail.\r\rWarning: There is an older gentleman that hikes this area nude. Loves hiking, hates clothes but is safe and friendly.",
