    "description": "The Loop Trail is part of the Dobson Trail. Once you hike about .25km in there will be a fork in the path, the left keeps you on the main path, the right takes you to the loop trail. It follows Mill Creek shore and connects to the main trail again in another 1km.",
    "directions": "From 114 in riverview take a right onto gunningville blvd and then a left onto pine glenn. There are two parking lots after the bridge. Either is fine.",
