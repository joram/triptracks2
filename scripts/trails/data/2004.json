    "description": "NTS Map:92B5.  A short (1.5 km) steep hike that works its way 240 meters up to Mount Wells summit. The trail has loose dirt in parts in dry weather, mud when raining. Lots of hiking over rock. Beautiful stands of Hairy Manzanita. Not busy park. View of sooke, Olympic mountains, langford and Victoria, mill hill, Mount Finlayson. All in all, a great cardio workout.",
    "directions": "From victoria to Goldstream turn left onto Sooke Lake Road, left onto humpback road. Follow until the park parking lot, about 1 km.\r\nThe park can also be accessed from Sooke Road (highway 14), North onto Humpback Road. It's about 2 km from Sooke Road. Be careful on Humpback road, it's single lane in some areas with many blind spots.",
