    "description": "A couple of small falls of about 10 and 15ft on this brook located very close to a logging rd.  This time you don?t have to bushwhack far for the reward.  The forest is dense but once you hit the river it\u00e8s easy to make your way to the falls.",
    "directions": "Highway 348 at lower Caledonia, turn on Side West River Rd.  Brook runs under bridge at N45 15.701 W62 15.755....follow upstream from this point",
