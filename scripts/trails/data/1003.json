    "description": "Outside of the city and away from the the traffic - on the trail I mean! This hike is great - the first hour is the real cardio-boost, followed by a mix of interesting clambering conditions (you've got roots, rocks, trees, lakes and more!). Fantastic viewpoints and flora and fauna all the way. On those hot summer days, you can even go for a dip in Buntzen lake at the bottom when finished!",
    "directions": "From Lougheed Highway in Coquitlam, go west (turn left) along Barnett highway into Port Moody. Turn right on Ioco Road, then follow the signs to Buntzen lake (about 6km). Stay in the topmost parking lot in the park, and walk back along the entrance road to the gate on your left - the trail head is marked the Halvor Lunden trail. About ten minutes in (along the rocks), the real fun begins at the trailhead on your right.",
