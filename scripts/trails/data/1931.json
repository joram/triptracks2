    "description": "NTS Map:92B5.  A relatively short dirt trail with a steady raise to the Summit (approx 1.5 km).  There are many trails leasding to the summit and they tend to cross the main trail in several places.  The trail also has several mountain bike ramps, jumps and ladders. Walkers should keep dogs leashed to prevent a run in with a bicycle.  Most of the trail is wooded but the summit is quite open and can get pretty warm.  (Bring water).  Remain on bearing WSW following well used trails.",
