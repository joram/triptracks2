    "description": "Racehorse Peak (Oct. 5th, '08). Racehorse Peak is the unofficial moniker for the un-named peak just to the north of Mount Ward in the Crowsnest Pass.\nWe biked up Racehorse Pass  as described here on trailpeak, and ditched our bike at the top of the Pass.\nIt was a wickedly windy, cold October day when we did this scramble. We did not get much of a view when we got higher up into the clouds... but we summited with the hopes that the weather would blow off while we were hiking (it never did!)\nElevation gain from the top of the pass was about 600 metres. The ridge continues north and I would like to return someday and follow the ridge to bag some of the other peaks to the north.",
