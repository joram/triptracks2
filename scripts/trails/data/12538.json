    "description": "This is a nice day trip around the largest island in Halifax Harbour.  Full circumnavigation is about 16 km. I put in at MacCormacks Beach in Eastern Passage and paddle across to Lawlor Island, along its coastline, and then across the channel to McNabs Island.  Once at McNabs, I'll usually paddle into the harbour and then out towards the seward side of the island. On windy days, the seaward side can be rough, so make note of the forecast.  There are several coves to pop in and explore and also many nice hiking trails on the island.  We're lucky to have such a nice day trip destination that relatively few locals bother to explore.",
    "directions": "Put in at McCormacks Beach. At low tide, be prepared to drag your boat across sand/rocks/shells. Wear old sneakers or water shoes with a good sole. 44.6081478,-63.4948387",
