    "description": "The divide lake trail starts at the south parking lot of okanagan mountain.  It's really a service road, so to make the hike a little more exciting, you can take the old cn trail, which links to this trail 4 km up from the parking lot.  Its a long exposed climb, bring suncreen.  camping and swimming are possible at divide lake.  the summit of okanagan mountain is 20 min further.  25 km is to the top and out, and could be done in a 7 or 8 hour day, depending on play time at the top.  i have seen people bike up this trail, but i wouldn't want to.",
    "directions": "follow pandosy and lakeshore in kelowna almost to the end.  technically out of kelowna city limits i think.  there is a parking lot on the right side, and the trail begins across the road and up.",
