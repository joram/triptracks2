    "description": "L'Acadian trail is a very nice loop route near Cheticamp, Cape Breton. It runs for 9 K and offers different things for different people. Myself, I am big on terrain and vistas. This route offers that, and also interesting discoveries for those interested in the flora and fauna too. To each his own. This trail showed much evidence of Fauna in the bear and moose scat. I think the billions of blueberries must be a drawing feature. \r\n\r\nAt the trail's end, my GPS read 1152 feet above sea level. My best memories of the trail were the hardwood groves of easily climbable trees on the return part of the loop. It was like an enchanted forest.\r\n\r\nTo quote my 2002 trail log...\r\n\"A shitty trail by all accounts\" Not so much the trail; the trail was great. We saw both fresh moose and bear scat. It's neat how different people get different things from the same trail experience. Rachael really likes the changing flora, and I'm really big on terrain and vantage points. Must stop to eat the blue barries!",
    "directions": "Entering the Cabot Trail from the Cheticamp side, look for trail # 1 on the right. This trail is well documented in the park's brochures and on their website.",
