    "description": "A moderate 600m vertical climb over about 4.5 kms takes you to the ridge/peak.  Very popular for backcountry skiing, split-boarding or snowshoeing.  Once at the top, you get views of Falls Lake and the surrounding peaks of the Coquihalla Recreation Area.",
    "directions": "Take the Falls Lake Exit on Highway 5, driving North from Hope.  Turn left under the highway through the underpass, and turn left once on the opposite side of the highway.  Turn right onto the first road and depending on how much snow is there, you may need to park here.  Trail starts wherever you can park, and then splits off later to either Falls Lake or Zoa Ridge.",
