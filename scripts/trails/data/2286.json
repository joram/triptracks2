    "description": "NTS Map: 082P04A good urban loop, mostly paved with 3km of some sweet single-track just to make it interesting (although the single-track can be bypassed in favour of more concrete).90% of the trail is all bike trails with no vehicle traffic.  The small amount of roadways required at the S end of the loop is quiet residential.A great after dinner ride, I've done it in literally all 12 months of the year.I can't give you a link to Calgary's Bike Trails maps as they change their URL freakin' daily and links immediately stop working, so click here and search bicycle route for a pop-up link to Calgary's GREAT map of Pathways and trails.",
    "directions": "Many parking areas along the route, anywhere near the Zoo, Max Bell Arena, Glenmore Inn, Bird Sanctuary, Sam Livingston Fish Hatchery and more.",
