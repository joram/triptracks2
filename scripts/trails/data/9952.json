    "description": "On the 1A hwy at Exshaw AB - trail head across the 1A from cement plant - excellent hike/scramble - often OK to do in winter because it's so 'front range'.  The rock/slab is very pitted so it holds you hiking boots well making it an easy scramble - very little use of hands - mostly a hike .",
    "directions": "On the 1A hwy at Exshaw AB - approx 1hr west of Calgary or 10min east of Canmore AB - park just on/off roadside across from the cement plant. Follow the visible ridge up.",
