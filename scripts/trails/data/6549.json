    "description": "This rugged foot path follows the south bank of Mary Vine Creek from the Galloping Goose to Peden Lake. Though this is the shortest route into Peden Lake, the terrain is a bit more difficult.\r\rAt the very end of the last parking lot for the Sooke Potholes there is an access point for the Galloping Goose. Directly across from this access point is the remains of an old road heading off into the woods. Follow this road, which becomes a foot path after a short distance, to the pipeline. Turn right along the pipeline for about 100 feet. Turn left and follow the well worn footpath. As you near the lake you will reach the junction of two old roads, follow the road which climbs up towards the lake.",
    "directions": "From Victoria follow the island highway west toward Sooke. The island highway becomes Sooke Road. Just before the bridge over Sooke River, turn Right onto Sooke River Road. Park in the last parking lot for the Sooke Potholes. A parking fee may be in effect in summer months.",
