    "description": "This is a lovely trail that winds its way around Killarney Lake on Bowen Island.",
    "directions": "Immediately after leaving the Ferry you will encounter the Public Library. Turn right at this intersection and follow it to the end of the road. On the left side is the entrance to the park and the beginning of the trails that make their way to Killarney Lake and Mount Gardner. This is an easy hike with little change in elevation. I've included the route to Mount Gardner which is a much steeper workout.",
