    "description": "The trail is relatively rough and can be quite muddy, even in summer. It also requires a long drive on rough logging roads and while I have seen cars make the trip I would recommend a 4x4. Be sure to air down the tires (I blew one of mine) you're a long way from town. O.K. back to the hike. As I've said, its ankle twisting territory so watch where you're going. \r\nAbout 10km of forested trail will bring you to the Dewar Creek Hotspring. This is Canada's hottest spring (I think) and while there are a few pools suitable for soaking, the water issues from the ground at about 85 degrees! \r\nFrom the spring continue another .5km up the trail to where it ends at the campsite in Bugle Basin, a beautiful meadow in the valley between Hall and Radiant Peak.",
    "directions": "From Kimberley head south to Marysville and take the St Mary Road turnoff to the West. Follow this road for about 64km to the Purcell Wilderness Consevation area. Topo map 82F is usefull for getting there.",
