    "description": "Lake Carnarvon is a moderately used hiking trail that ascends to a bowl between two peaks. This hike offers great views and is a popular fishing destination for anyone who wants to make the climb. The first 6 km are pretty easy, and can be completed using a mountain bike. After that, it is mostly a rocky ascension. Just hiking can take 8 hours there and back, though you would cut off some time if you chose to bike. We turned this in to an overnight stay, and was quite difficult with 40 pounds on your back. The climb is steep with a lot of scree and rocks, and chains that you need to pull yourself up to get to the top of the bowl. The views were well worth it!",
    "directions": "Follow Highway 40 (Kananaskis Trail) until you hit the Cat Creek hiking sign. There you can park and follow the logging road away from the Cat Creek start point.",
