    "description": "A short, easy trail located in Elk Island National park. Moose, Elk and Plains Bison can be frequently seen as well as the Beaver Lodge the trail is named for. In the winter the trail is not groomed so it would be best to give it a few days after a snowfall to let the skiiers pack it down a bit if you don't want to slog through the snow.",
    "directions": "Trail Head is approximately 16 km north of the park entrance off of the Yellowhead highway 44km East of Edmonton",
