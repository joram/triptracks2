    "description": "Superb hike, straight up in an avalanche gully loaded with flowers, dead trees and scree to get to the summit block. You can scramble or climb up the block but rocks are not solid. We did it, but we chose a path with great holds and pretty close to the col where the official trail is. Ridge walk is quite narrow sometimes, but it is a superb 700 metres walking with stunning views of quite a few glaciers and Castle Mountain at the end of highway 93. If you don't like the exposure on the ridge, you can try loosing some elevation on the right side of the ridge and get to the summit that way instead. But the ridge walk is very nice not really difficult except for some exposure.From the highway, you'll see a clear trail. Go up that trail for about 50 metres and take on your right for approx. 200 metres. A big arrow made of rocks is showing you the way up the gully from there.// Net elevation of 1249 m, TOT of 1277 m and max 2657 m.",
    "directions": "From Banff, get to Castle junction/Highway 93 South and drive for about 22 km. Watch for a quite obvious trail on your left, just after the highway take on a large turn left.",
