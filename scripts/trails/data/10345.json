    "description": "This Fish Creek submission includes the new and approved singletrack developed for you with the help of our hard working friends at CMBA (Calgary Mountain Bike Alliance).\r\rWest of Macleod Trail all the way to 37 St SW is a, frankly, buncha amazing singletrack that I didn't know existed.  The included GPS data is 90% singlerack with a bit of pathways where needed to tie it together.\r\rSome of it can be very rooty and technical (considering where  you are and how easy it is to get to).",
    "directions": "South side of Calgary roughly ~130 Ave S and Elbow, 14, 24th or more  streets East.  Bebo Grove, Votiers Flats or really any of the other Fish Creek access points.",
