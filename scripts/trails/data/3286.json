    "description": "This trail is part of The North Boundary Trail. I know the trail has been listed for Berg Lake but bikers can only go to the Kinney Lake camping area. This is an awesome ride - like riding in the rain forest. The views of Mount Robson and the surrounding mountains are spectacular.  The cedar trees are so huge and the smell of them is wonderful. There is little elevation gain on this trail but this trail I believe is for the sights not the ride itself.\nAllow more time if hiking. The 3 hour estimate was based on mountain biking.",
    "directions": "From the Mount Robson Recreation area on highway 16 go 2.5 km north to the parking lot.
