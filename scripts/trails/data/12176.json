    "description": "The Tamihi Creek hike follows the Tamihi Creek along an old Forest Service Road, which in not accessible to vehicles due to a washout.  It is a fairly easy hike, with gradual elevation and great views of local mountains and water falls.",
    "directions": "From the Trans Canada (Highway 1) drive south on Vedder Road in Chilliwack until you come to the Vedder River and turn onto Chilliwack Lake Road.  The road signs are very well marked.  Continue on Chilliwack Lake Road until you cross the Chilliwack River and turn right onto the gravel road at a forestry service campground.  Continue down the gravel road for approximately 1 km and turn left onto the Tamihi Creek Forest Service Road.  Follow the road up the hillside, keeping right at a fork until the road ends (approximately 2 kms).",
