    "description": "A short, interpretive hike through a unique inland ecosystem not found this far inland anywhere else on the continent. 800-2000 year old cedars and much more to see. Maps and signage throughout the park describe local vegetation and flora. Some steep climbs, but still suitable for all age groups. Lower section now has new boardwalk built for wheelchair accessibility. Upper trails lead to waterfalls and mountain viewpoints. More than one trail loop option - full trail takes about one hour.Although I believe the park is accessible year-round, weather may cause some portions of the trail to be unsafe or even closed. Please use caution.Excellent write up at http://wetbelt.unbc.ca/af-trail.htm",
    "directions": "From Prince George, drive east on Yellowhead highway. Trail system is on south side of highway approximately 113 km east of PG, 6.6 km west of the Slim Creek rest area. Signage marks 1 km from Ancient Forest parking lot (gravel lot, room for RVs & trailers provided)",
