    "description": "This fall location was shared by another waterfall enthusiast; Abvhiael Crowley.   This was a very different experience for me as I don?t get to visit many known waterfalls anymore as I have been exploring this province for a while.  The fall couldn?t be easier to explore.  It?s no more than 20m from a dirt road.  In spring or after rainfal, you must be able to hear ort see it through the trees.  The brook is of a small size so don?t be surprised if the fall is dry from time to time in the summer.I went on the left hand side of the brook (facing downstream) and had a good view of this 25ft slider type fall.  Be careful has the slope has lots of glass shards so maybe go the long way around instead of straight down to the base of the fall like I did.I also explored up both branches of this brook?upstream of the road and found on each branch two old water reservoirs.  The biggest one was approx. at;  N46.20063\u00b0 W61.35242\u00b0",
