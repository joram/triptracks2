    "description": "Again this is more of a place to visit when you might not have the time for a long hike or you want to break up a long drive. The short hike through the woods will lead you to a fairly big waterfall. From the road you wouldn?t expect anything of that size in those woods so it?s a good surprise that way. The forest around the stream is mostly conifers while the slopes around are dominated by beech trees. The walking is easy as you come down a fair size slope to the base of the fall. It doesn?t look like the base of the falls would have enough water for a swimming hole in the summer which is a pity because the forest is quite nice and you feel quite removed from the world when you are at the base of the falls.",
    "directions": "Take highway 101 to Exit 15 and turn right on highway 360\u00a0towards Harbourville. Continue on this road as it climbs the north Mountains. Turn left on Barley St. Drive about 600m to where Givans Bk flows underneath the road. Head downstream?",
