    "description": "Easy 16Km trail to Champlain Lookout. \r\nThe First 2Km are uphill with loose gravel turning into relatively flat terrain with some rolling hills. The view at the top is all worth it and what comes up must come down. The way home is a lot more fun. A good trail for beginner-intermidiate.",
    "directions": "Take Highway 105 to Old Chelsea. Make a left at the stop sign and continue down the hill. Once you past a small strip of restaurants, take your first left and then stay right. You should be on Ch. Kingsmere. Keep going until you get to parking No.7. Follow the trail straight ahead. You can`t miss it.",
