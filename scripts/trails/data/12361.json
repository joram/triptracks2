    "description": "A short hike after about 45mins of driving on logging roads. 4 wheel drive recommended.The first couple of kilometers is up a rough section of logging road. From where the trail begins it is about 15 or 20 min hike to the hut and another 10 mins up to the peak. Breathtaking views for such a short hike. This is part of the Sunshine Coast Trail. (SCT)",
