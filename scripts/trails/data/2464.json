    "description": "Trail follows along the lakeshore of Kootenay Lake. The trail features many quality viewpoints,as it meanders through a diverse landscape. Predominately Interior Cedar Hemlock bioclimatic zone, the flora is very diverse. Ponderosa pine grow on the rocky outcrops, with an unusual moss understory. Many flowers were in bloom, (lady slippers, twin berry, trillium etc.) were all observed on our May hike. The trail surface is well kept, and accesses some prime Marine Park camping areas.",
    "directions": "Trailhead originates in Pilot Bay Provincial Park, which is accessed from the Kootenay Bay Ferry terminal. A few km. from Crawford Bay, where any necessary provisions may be obtained, the paved road leads to the Park.\r\nThe closest major center is Nelson B.C. on the west side of Kootenay Lake, with access to Kootenay Bay being from the scenic free ferry crossing to the East Shore. If puzzled, just ask any local and they will happily offer a local perspective to your wayfinding.",
