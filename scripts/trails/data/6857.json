    "description": "Distance 12km round tripelevation gain 950mStart elevation 1135mfinish elevation 185mGreat little hidden jewel of Golden Ears Park just off the west canyon trail. This is a very steep trail and just goes up and up. With relief and reward at a view point along the way. Elevation grade drops for a short section before the really steep section to the peak. Which will require some hand holds to get past some of the rock sections. But you are  rewarded with great views",
    "directions": "Drive to Golden Ears Provincial park and follow signs to West Canyon trail parking lot. Take the West Canyon Trail then take a left up the View Point Trail. Continue past the overgrown lake viewpoint to the left and past a creek crossing with a waterfall. 40 passes from them 1.5km marker hang a right and head straight up into the forest and pick up some flagging tape. Past this point the trail is obvious and climbs steeply up to the peak.",
