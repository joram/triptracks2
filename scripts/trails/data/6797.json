    "description": "Starting from Garibaldi Park Rd at Cherry Dr in the Valleycliff area of Squamish to the peak of Mount Crumpit.\r\rThe GPS track may not be the easiest path to follow and the trail isn't always well marked but it isn't too difficult.\r\rThe way down I chose is tricky in a few spots but you do manage to get down in very little time.",
    "directions": "Park at the public parking area about 400m from the trailhead along Garibaldi Park Rd.  Walk along up along Garibaldi Park Rd you will see the trail in the corner on the left side of the road.",
