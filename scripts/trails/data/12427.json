    "description": "This trail seems to be the  most interesting after a good rain  the next day with clouds in the sky . Later in the year  it becomes a more arid trail  and dry typical Okanagan land scape.  So depending on what you like  it is still a great trail with views of the canyon below . The hiking trail is well used and seems to be cleared  once in a while . The trail is 5.42 km approx. one way",
