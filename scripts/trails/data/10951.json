    "description": "Second highest peak in the Baker area. On a clear day you get great views of Baker and the other peaks. With great snow an awesome ride down (about 1.5km fall line ski). Big hard climb for a day trip as you will likely have to pass over avy debree and possibly have a bit of booting to do as well on a few steeps pitches. The return, after you get down into the valley, can be a tough climb out as we found however if you don't mind a longer climb its worth trying to do longer switches back towards your starting tracks instead of a shorter but steeper return up. The tracks included do not include actual summit which we didn't do. We were about 250m vert shy of the top. You will need an ice axe for the final ascent. Not a bad idea to take a rope with you, we did pass a large crevice but it was easily avoided. Depending on when you go you might have more of them to deal with. We lucked out and had both a blue bird day and deep powder!",
    "directions": "Basically you need to go to the White Salmon Glacier ski area of Baker and take the access/ski run on the far left (fairly flat) for about 1km before heading over toward Shuksan.",
