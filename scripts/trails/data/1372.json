    "description": "This is a trail system developed by the equestrian society who have a show park near by. Parts of the trail have been maintained by a group of mtn bikers (twisted shifters, et al) and have thus named it, or parts of it \"the Goat Trail.\"\r\n\r\nOn this trail you will find one or two great potential spots for back country camping. Water is not readily in supply, so bring a supply.\r\n\r\nThe terrain consists of rolling hills and mixed forest. Near by, runs the West River. Because it's within a tidal zone, the water is brackish.\r\n\r\nThis is a year round trail. It's great for mountain biking and hiking when the snow is at bay, and is also great for snow shoeing during the winter months.\r\n\r\nThe trail connects to Strathgartney Provincial Park, and its trail which is also documented within trailpeak.\r\n\r\n-S.

    "directions": "Follow Route 1 (the Transcanada HWY)from Charlottetown for about 20 minutes. After going over the Bonshaw hills, look for a church at the bottom of the hill just before a bridge. Turn left into the church parking lot. Trailhead is through a wooden gate.",
