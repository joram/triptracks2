    "description": "This would be an easy trail if not for the elevation gain. Well marked, great views. Doable in winter due to limited snowfall in the area. If completing in the summer take lots of H2O as the area is very hot. Watch for Cactus (Likely) and Rattle snakes (unlikely)",
    "directions": "Park off road across from the CP Rail shed, looking uphill you will see a water tower for the Village of Ashcroft.",
