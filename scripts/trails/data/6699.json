    "description": "A 6 km ski/snowshoe ride with Martine, Sylvie and Michel from the  Lac Daigle to the Lac Tupper.  We (Bruno ,Sylvie) have our Yourte on the Lac Daigle; Michel and Martine have their cabin on the Lac Tupper. Both places are in Quebec, but we followed the border with Labrador for one third of the distance.  The snow covers all the lower vegetation making the ride easy in winter.  I could not help;  I have also included a picture a 24 inches super wide track snowmobile  in the snow shot at the base of the hill range.\rThe scenery on that day was fantastic: clear blue sky, shining snow and phantom like trees on the top (look at the pictures). \rThese trees are specially designed for northern Quebec weather: minimizing the exposed area to freezing snow and having a flexible trunk. \r\r",
