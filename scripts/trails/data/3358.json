    "description": "Originally constructed in 1997/98, this path takes you along the Boughton River eco system. This linear trail is approximately 4.5K each way, and is periodically flagged by yellow reflective tags.I first heard about the trail through word of mouth, and within a week, had to see it for myself. Just when I was starting to lament having hiked about everything worth doing on PEI, along comes a trail that?s experiencing its tenth year anniversary! It makes me wonder what else I don?t know about?I would have to say that this is quite a welcoming technical trail. It has quick ups, downs and twists among occasional roots and closely cropped tree trunks. Great river views, and mixed forest offer visual flair enhanced by autumn?s palette of color. There?s one viewing station that offers a great vantage point of the river, and according to their  website, another bigger tower exists somewhere else.This is new favorite trail I hope others seek to hike. I figure if others are like me, they?ll go hike it, and fix some little things here and there. The trail reflects the positive health of frequent use. I can?t wait to snowshoe and snow bike this trail come winter!Shannon BurtEast Coast editor",
