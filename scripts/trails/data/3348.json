    "description": "Easy little trail, a little twisty and tight.  Follows the Elbow River.  Starts in the Paddy's campground (or highway when gated for season) and comes out at the highway a couple/three km West.\r\n\r\nWorks well as a lead-in to Elbow Valley (and then on to Sulphur Springs, etc.)\r\nThie trail is right beside:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r",
    "directions": "South Calgary, go west on Hiway 22x, keep going west after Bragg Creek. Park at Beaver Lodge or Powderface lots, 17.2km W of the second Bragg Creek road. Start from the Paddy's Flats parking lot.\r\n\r\nLook for a trail along the river bank going West.\r",
