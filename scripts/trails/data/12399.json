    "description": "This is the first section of the epic seven summits trail, which can be rode as an out and back (often going as far as you can before hitting snow in the early season). 700 m of ascent (or less depending on when you hit snow). Probably the nicest section of the Seven Summits in terms of awesome flowy singletrack.",
