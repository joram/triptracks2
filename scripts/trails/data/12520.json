    "description": "Mount Work is one of the tallest mountains in the CRD. The trails are well marked and the terrain is not very technical. Great day hike, beautiful views near the top of the mountain and down by the water. The GPS route includes a loop down to Mckenzie Bight via the Mckenzie Bight trail and then back up via the Cascade trail, which is very steep but there are steps built into the terrain.",
