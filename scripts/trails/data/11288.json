    "description": "The Beverley Creek trail heads up the narrow Beverley Creek valley north of Whistler Olympic Park in the Callaghan Valley.  After a steeper climb at the start the trail levels out and offers some pleasant valley bottom skiing.  Puma Peak can be reached by branching off the trail at the half way point, or continue to the end and climb to Rainbow Mountain.",
    "directions": "Leave highway 99 at Callaghan Valley road and follow signs to Whistler Olympic Park at the end of the road.  Park at the Biathlon Range and follow the XC ski trail west (left when looking at the range) under a bridge.  The Beverley Creek trail begins at the low point of the dip beyond the bridge.  Follow the trail downhill to Madeley Loop XC ski trail and turn right, heading north to the \"Maple Leaf Bridge\" Over Beverley Creek.  The true trailhead is just west of the bridge.  The trail climbs up into the forest from here keeping on the west side of the creek.",
