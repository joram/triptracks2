    "description": "I do not get many tips on waterfalls after exploring for many years in NS.\u00a0 However Jonathan G gave me the tips on this one.\u00a0 Thanks, it's a beauty! Follow the brook from the road and see a first fall that may be dry within 200m from bushwacking from the road.\u00a0 after that follow the brook downstream bypassing countless cascades.\u00a0 At the fork, continue downtream for another 900m until the lower fall set amidst an evergreen stand.",
