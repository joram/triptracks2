    "description": "A very well marked and groomed trail in the Snoqualmie Pass area of Washington, USA.  The outer loop is 7.1 km and has some steeper slopes, but there are several smaller loops and shortcuts with gentler grades for the beginner.  A Sno-Pass is required (pick one up in North Bend on your way). There is GPS data attached to this trail (see \"download GPS\"), which if loaded into your GPS can help you find route points.",
    "directions": "From Seattle, drive East on I-90 to exit 63.  At the end of the exit ramp, turn right into the parking area.  This is a popular trail, so get there early!",
