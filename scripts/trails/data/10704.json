    "description": "Small spur trail on the right hand side of the ATV track leading up from the Spider Lake Estates.  Ride the main atv trail and weave in and around some large puddles for about 1km.  the trail starts and ends on this atv track.  The entrance or exit if you choose is about 1km from the power lines.\nThis small trail is fun and fast. It has minimal roots or rock and is pretty smooth.  There isn't much elevation gain or loss on this trail so you can ride it either way.  \nIt rides mostly in a forested area so you will be nicely shaded from the sun on most of the trail.",
    "directions": "Waverley Road.  Turn on Spider Lake Estates Rd.  Park at the end of this road by the power lines.  Ride under the power lines and up the main atv track in front of you.",
