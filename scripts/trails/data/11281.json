    "description": "This is another hike to a fall in the series; there is no way that there is a fall up that brook.  Leaving your car by the guardrail, you walk to the brook and follow it upstream through a mixed forest.   Walking is relatively easy and the prize after about 300m is this 30ft waterfall cascading on a rock wall.  Looking at where you started very few people would have guessed such a hidden jewel lied there so enjoy!",
    "directions": "Highway 202 to West Gore.  Turn on Mines Rd and park at guard rail/bridge over MacInnis Brook.  Bonus of this hike is another 5ft waterfall located downstream of the Mines Rd.",
