    "description": "This is an easy hike to a series of falls near East Ferry, Digby Neck.  If ever you have to wait for the ferry to Long Island, you can easily explore this stream to see a few falls.  The gps track follows the stream from a dirt road all the way to the sea shore but it is easier to use the cleared area located to the south of the stream to access the lower part of the stream.  all the falls are located within the last 100m of the brook as it falls into the ocean.",
    "directions": "Highway 217 from Digby to East Ferry.  in East Ferry turn on Beach Meadows Rd and park at the metal gate in front of a wooden bridge.  all the falls are located downstream on this brook.  although the the signs says the land is for sale it also welcomes hikers onto the property.",
