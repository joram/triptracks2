    "description": "This is a short hike to some less know waterfall (45.6218304299 Longitude : -62.9716239218).  These might even offer a nice swimming hole in the summer.  The walk in the woods is easy as there is not a lot of shrubery and the forest is mixed.  Near the top of the fall you need to go around the steep ravine and walk uptream to the fall.  There is another small fall on another tributary of the brook at 45.6319374125  -62.9549538251",
    "directions": "Highway 256 towards Scotsburn.  Turn on Loganville Rd and then on Macbeth Rd.  The mian waterfall is about 400m down the stream you go over at the 90 degree bend in the road.  GPS coordinates are above",
