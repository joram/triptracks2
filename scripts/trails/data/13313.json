    "description": "Not the tallest fall around but it is scenic nonetheless and somewhat easily accessible if you are willing to bushwhack about 200m.The trail leads to the old Centre Rawdon Gold mine adit which is fun to check out...although bring boots as it is a wet adit.   Once you are done with the adit, continue to follow the brook upstream to a nicely framed waterfall.",
    "directions": "Highway 14.  Turn on MacInnis Rd and park right after the guard rail on your right.   The trail follows the brook to the adit.  The fall is approximately at;  N45.05503\u00b0 W63.83713\u00b0",
