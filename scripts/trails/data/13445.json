    "description": "A nice and unexpected waterfall on Robinson Book.  What is so special about this one is that I only had to follow directions from somebody else for once.  Many thanks to Deryck S!  The hike is along a logging road and when it turns completely to the north, I just continued straight on a portion of a road that was less used some getting a bit overgrown but not too much.  This road also turns to the north and from here just plunge into the woods and find Robinson Brook located just 200 m further into the woods.  Once at the brook, follow it downstream to where a tributary from the east side flows into the brook.  there is a nice 30ft fall on that tributary.",
    "directions": "Parker Mountain Rd to the north.  Turn right on Pipers Lane.  Where ot does a 90 degree turn and becomes Tower Rd.  Park and continue on the logging road heading east (see the gpx track!)",
