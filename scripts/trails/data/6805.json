    "description": "The trail leads from the Parksville Industrial Park to the Englishman River Top Bridge area. A few ups and down but nothing difficult. It starts off in an open area and you gradually proceed into a wooded area and the trail will take you under the railway and highway bridges.",
    "directions": "If you're traveling Northward, drive along Industrial way until you pass Tuan Rd on your left and then you'll see a small gravel area on the left for parking. The trail entrance is clearly marked.",
