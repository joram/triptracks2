    "description": "NTS Map:92B5.  This is a well signed trail in East Sooke Park (see http://www.crd.bc.ca/parks/ for maps and park ammenities) The trail starts as a continuation of Pike Rd and is initially an easy stroll down an improved path.  Once you turn off of Pike Road onto the Anderson Cove/Mount Macguire Trail, its difficulty increases as you gain altitude.  Once you leave the combined trail and continue on the Mount Macguire Trail is becomes very steep but the view towards the Olympic Pennensula is worth the heart pounding effort.  The trail is very well signed from the Pike Road Trail Head and I am told that it is equally as well signed from the Anderson Cove Parking Lot.",
