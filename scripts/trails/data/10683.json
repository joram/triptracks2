    "description": "Boundary Lake, Jasper National ParkBoundary Lake is located near the Columbia Icefields 109Km South of the Jasper Town site and approximately 110K North of Lake Louise. This hike is considered easy with an elevation gain of under 200 Meters. Allow 1.5 hours for a return trip. The Boundary Lake trailhead is unmarked. It's located at the Banff Park Boundary Marker parking lot just East of the Wilcox Creek Campground. The trail leads down behind the parking lot, across the meadow, then East along an old gravel road. Look for a well worn trail leading up to your right approximately 400 Meters from where you started. This trail winds it way up through an old growth pine and spruce forest until you reach Boundary Lake. Boundary Lake is a beautiful turquoise blue color created from silt off the Boundary Glacier. Views from the lake shore towards the North East Face of Mount Athabasca and the Boundary Glacier are stunning. I'm not sure if the lake holds any large fish but a member in our party did see a minnow size fish when crossing the outflow stream. Once you cross the outflow stream near the trail on the East side of the lake you can continue on up to the Boundary Glacier and Mount Athabasca or the ridge above the parking lot. Climbers use this route when climbing the North East Face of Mount Athabasca. Views leading up to the Boundary Glacier and back towards Boundary Lake are unforgettable and well worth the effort. Do not climb up the glacier unless you have mountaineering experience and the proper mountaineering gear. Trail heads to Wilcox Pass, Parker Ridge, Hilda Ridge, Weeping Wall, Mount Athabasca North Glacier and the Saskatchewan Glacier are located near here. You are in Bear country.",
