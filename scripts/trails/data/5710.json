    "description": "I kayaked the N.Thompson in September this year for the first time.  The water was still high enough that there weren't any problems with the gravel bars.  In some sections you have to keep your eye out for logs just below the surface and there are two small sections of rapids near Heffley Creek and just before the Mclure ferry (Fishtrap Rapids).  Having paddled this type of river before but having no experience with fast water I didn't have a problem with these short stretches of rapids.\r\rThe trip took two days (~8hrs/day)(~100km) and there were an abundance of camping sites along the trip.  The best areas were before Barrier and past Mclure.  The water is quite slow moving so you pretty much have to paddle the entire time but the scenery is nice enough to keep you entertained.",
    "directions": "Put in at the Little Fort ferry.  There are signs to the ferry location as you enter Little Fort.  I exited the river at Riverside Park in downtown Kamloops.  Both locations are easy to find and access.",
