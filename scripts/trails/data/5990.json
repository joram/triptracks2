    "description": "Starts off on an easy trail, then a steep climb to the top of Heart Mountain - which is actually a false peak. Then you go along a ridge to the south, that curves north-east, then you descend on a ridge east of where you started. You come back on a flat path back to the parking lot.",
    "directions": "South side of Trans Canada Highway, at Lac des Arcs interchange, 75km west of Calgary, 36km east of Banff.",
