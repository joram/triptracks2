    "description": "Camp Morton Provincial Park is a relatively new area for cross-country skiing. This trail profile shows about 8 of the 12 km of trails available. Skiers will enjoy beautiful views of Lake Winnipeg, but over 95% of the trails pass through mature forests of oak, ash, and birch with the odd sprinkling of some magnificent white spruce. The trail is a well groomed single classic track (no skate skiing), fairly flat but with a few small ravine hills. A warm up shack is available. The trail is maintained by the Gimli Cross-country Ski Club.\r\rWe observed some wildlife (ruffed grouse) and tracks of deer, weasel, and squirrel. Keep an eye out for Barred Owls as we have a radio-marked male on territory just north of the trails. We welcome any reports of Barred Owls in this area!\r\rWe have also hiked some of these trails last spring - bring water proof footwear!",
    "directions": "Take highway 9 from Winnipeg to Gimli (lots of bakeries, restaurants, and accommodations), continue north for 5 km along provincial road #222. Watch for the easy to spot ski parking lot sign on the right (east) side of the road.",
