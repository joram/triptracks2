    "description": "\r\n\r\n\r\nNTS Map: 092G04Paddling in the northern Gulf Islands is a great way to spend a long weekend, and is easily accessible from Vancouver.  There are a number of Marine Parks to camp in, and generally sheltered waters make it a relatively easy trip.  Take the ferry from Vancouver to Nanaimo for direct access, or to Victoria if you'd like a nice drive up island.  From Nanaimo, take the Gabriola ferry (about a 5 minute drive south of the large ferry terminal) which runs about every 45 minutes.  There are several options for launching, including False Narrows, Degnen Bay or Silva Bay.  Paid camping is available in Pirate's Cove Marine Park, on the south end of De Courcy Island, Blackberry Point, on the west side of Valdes Island, and at the lovely Dionisio Point, on the north end of Galiano Island.  Hazards:  Currents run extremely fast through both Gabriola Passage and Porlier Pass - up to 9 knots! creating whirlpools, standing waves, rip curls etc.  Make sure you know how to use the current tables, and time your trip through these areas at slack.Other areas of fast current include False Narrows and Dodd Narrows, on either side of Mudge Island.Watch out for boat traffic in all areas, but especially in the passages.  Most of the Gulf Islands are inhabited, so make sure you're not camping in someone's front yard!",
