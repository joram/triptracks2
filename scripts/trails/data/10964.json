    "description": "Copper Mine Trail/Cape Blow Me Down Trail is part of the international Appalachian Trail and is located 30 mins from Corner Brook, close to a little town called Lark Harbor. At the base of the mountain is a beautiful waterfall located only 5 mins walk from the parking area and the blocked off opening to old Copper Mine shaft can be viewed at the base as well. Its a little bit of an intense hike to the summit but worth every bit of sweat and tears once you reach it. On the way up to the summit there are various look outs, where will will see the beautiful views of the Bay of Islands such as, Seal's Nest, Governor's Island, and more. There are trail markers on trees and big metal pole markers (once you reach the top of the trail) to show you the way. Benches are located at various points going up the mountain so you can rest or have a lunch :) I did this trail in March this year and I would suggest hiking poles for anyone who would be venturing up there that time of year.",
    "directions": "The trail is well marked and easy to follow at any time of year. At the base of the mountain there is a trail sign with trail lengths and difficulty ratings.",
