    "description": "Completed on July 25, 2020 in dry conditions with several helpful snow patches.\nEdwards Rating: II (III) M M\n5.5 to 8.5 hours\nElevation of 1017 m NET, 1204 m TOT & max 2957 m\n*** GPS Route incorrect on the way up, but interesting with great views and some moderate scrambling. Use our descent route only for an easier scramble.\nGear: Poles, GPS device, helmet recommended walking along cliff bands.\n\n*****\nI thought this would be obvious so I didn\u2019t bring a GPS track with me. It may be confusing as there are so many trails going up and no official trail even though one is excellent if you don\u2019t miss it. This is a moderate scramble the way we did it with some exposed scrambling up ledges. Even the easy way can be narrow and exposed at times and a fall there would be fatal. I do understand why people say it\u2019s an easy scramble but I don\u2019t agree. Views are absolutely stunning, which makes it one of our favorite scrambles ever!\n\nWe hiked up to Bow Falls and left the official trail to start hiking up a rubble slope, aiming for a treed ridge. We found a weakness in the first rock band to reach our first ledge. We walked along the second band and found quickly a narrow crack to climb to the second ledge. We then walked along the third band for about 200 m and found a weakness to scramble up again. We went straight up that fourth ledge and used a small waterfall to climb this time. We then turned right and reached a plateau with already exceptional views of Mount Thomson, Bow Glacier and so on. We realized quickly that we would not reach our objective up here so we went down a steep slope to the right and saw the actual trail. We followed cairns and footsteps using good snow patches to scramble up to the col. If you avoid the snow it will be frustrating as scree and rubble is unstable here. We should have followed the summit ridge closer to the col to save some time and energy as the summit is on your left after your turned right. Views of Peyto Glacier, surrounding tarns and lakes are magnificent here.\n\nOn the way down, we followed the trail all along and there are several cairns or flagged trees-rocks. This goes along to the right side of the valley and then follows one of the ledges we had climbed on our way up. Towards the end, we descended a gully, bushwhacked a bit and went down the rubble slope leading back to the official trail. We saw where we missed the trail coming up. When you pass the last trees on your right and close to the waterfall, you should see a bunch of cairns first and then a decent trail leading to that ledge. I wouldn\u2019t send someone with no scrambling experience there, but when you find that trail, it is quite straightforward.",
    "directions": "From Lake Louise, continue onto Trans-Canada Hwy for about 2.3 km and take the Alberta 93 exit toward Jasper. Continue for approx. 36 km and turn left just after Bow Lake. Park before Simpson's Num-Ti-Jah Lodge. The trailhead is passed the lodge.",
