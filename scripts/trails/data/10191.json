    "description": "A great but short ride, 12.1km with 525m of cumulative climbing.  But hey!  You can stand on the peak of an official mountain during the ride.  Then, 6km of downhilly goodness, some of it a little choppy, bring suspension.\r\rTypically done clockwise, but can be done either way.  It involves 3.0km of road to connect two ends of some great, technical singletrack / hiking trail.  There is a lot of rock, most of it is well anchored, but there are a few babyheads that might make you land on your head.\r\rYou can add in an optional ride / hike up to the peak of Jumpingpound Mountain, this will add another 30 or so m onto the elevation stats.\r\rIf you start from the S trailhead, the climbing is virtually all at once, gentler climb of 100m in 3km up the road, then 375m in 2.7km.  Surprsingly, it is virtually all rideable even though it is a 14% grade.\r\rYou can park at either end of the road, depends if you want to get the road over with first (makes a good warm up to the big climb), or after.",
    "directions": "Trailhead is about 1/2 way between Hiway 68 and Hiway 66, it is 19.5km S of 68, 15.0 N of 66.  Either way, the road is rough, gravelly and dusty, but a nice drive if you like backroads.  There is usually ample parking at a little 90 degree turn in the road.  And 50m N is more parking.",
