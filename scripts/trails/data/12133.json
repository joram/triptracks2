    "description": "More of a stop over than a trail, the Hopewell Falls are a nice hidden gem close to New Glasgow.  Depending on the water level, the river usually seperates into three distinct falls.  Looks like it would be deep enough to jump from some of the small cliffs into pools.",
    "directions": "Highway 347 south to Hopewell.  turn on Elgin Rd and park before or after bridge over the East River.  Walk downstream to the falls.",
