    "description": "nformation from an old map showed a 20ft fall somewhere in the upper reaches of this brook.  I had seen a dirt road leading upstream and towards the potential fall on the satellite imagery.  I turned on this road with my car but soon came to a locked gate.  I left my car there and continued as the road went uphill for a while.  I crested the hill and then came down a bit of elevation.  I turned into the woods in a place I thought there might be a waterfall.  A short 150m walk in the wood brought me to the brook.  No fall!  Should I go upstream or downstream.  I opted, correctly, to go downstream!  I was lucky as within 150m or so I came to the top of a gorgeous 20ft cascading type waterfall.  The way back wasn?t fun at all as I chose a line between the fall and the dirt road.  This are is chocked with small evergreens and is ultra hard to push though.  I should have detoured back upstream to an easier spot!",
