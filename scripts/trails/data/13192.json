    "description": "Archibald Brook is a decent size brook and it hides a nice two tier waterfall upstream of highway 7. To gain access, I knocked on the door of the house located next to the logging road to gain permission.  BTW if you are going for this fall, read the post on Cross Brook Fall which is located on the way to this one.The easiest way to Archibald Brook is to get to Cross Brook Fall and follow the brook downstream until it meets Archibald Brook.  Then head upstream for about 700m.  The bushwack is not easy but not hard either.  The fall is gorgeous.  The lower part is more of a slide type fall while the upper is a very wide plunge type.  After the fall, I made my way uphill and found some old logging road eventually leading me back to Cross Brook and the main logging road I needed to get out of there.",
