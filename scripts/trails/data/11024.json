    "description": "This is a trail that is on the west side of the ski hill in a provincial park.  The stands of hardwoods on the slope of the hill with the ferns and high canopy  is a  place to behold.  The view at the top of the hike is rewarding and overlooking a section of the Bras d'or Lake.  At the pinnacle of the trail you get the nice view and a large outcrop of rock to set your picnic.  It's short enough that you can do this after supper if you live in Sydney or as a small leg stretcher when you are travelling highway 4.",
    "directions": "Park entrance is due west of Ben Eion ski hill located on highway 4 between Sydney and St Peters, Cape Breton Island.",
