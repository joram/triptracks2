    "description": "A hike through the Skoki Valley to a curious rock formation with a waterfall through it. The valley itself is a beautiful alpine scenery with creeks, hedges, and wandering moose. It is well marked and there is no problem finding it. We went around the other (north) side of Skoki Mountain on the way back, which was well worth it. We did it on 1 July 2013.",
    "directions": "The assumption is that your base is in Skoki Lodge. See trails described on Trailpeaks.",
