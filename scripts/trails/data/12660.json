    "description": "Thetis Island was named after H.M.S. Thetis (in turn named after Thetis the Neriad, a sea nymph daughter of Zeus) , a British 36 gun frigate that was on the Pacific station from 1851 to 1853 and surveyed the area. Pioneers first preempted land on Thetis in 1873. In 1896 Lawrence Trail was built through the center of the Island to provide access form Preedy Harbour to the Lawrence homestead on Pilkey Point. The trail is nice and flat, and a great forest walk.Thetis Island and Kuper Island (to the south) were originally joined by mud flats, in 1905 a \"cut\" was dredged for the first time to allow boat traffic to pass. This channel is clearly visible on the satellite image (see our \"detail maps\" page). Thetis is located about three and a half miles from Vancouver Island, near Chemainus and about thirty five miles west of Vancouver, and, by road, about fifty miles north of the capital, Victoria, and twenty miles south of Nanaimo. Thetis is nestled within the Gulf islands, with Vancouver Island to the west, Saltspring Island to the south, Gabriola to the north and Valdes and Galiano to the east.",
