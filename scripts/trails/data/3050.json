    "description": "This is the most beautiful hike we have been on in a long time. Quite strenuous in the beginning you gain most of the elevation in a very short distance cutting back and forth through the lower forest region. \nAbout halfway up the mountain you break out of the forest and if you are as lucky enough as we were and take the hike in the late spring you emerge into mountain side fields of yellow wild flowers.\nWe hiked the rest of the way to the summit on the trail that went through these fields. At the top the panorama was fantastic! with unobstructed views of the Columbia Gorge, Mt. Hood and Mt. St. Helens.\nIf you are going to be hiking in the Columbia Gorge area this is one hike you can't miss!\nNote: poison oak and rattlesnakes can both be found in this area.",
    "directions": "Take State Hwy 14.  The trail head can be found nine miles east of Stevenson, just after mile post 53.\nAdditional information can be found here.",
