    "description": "This is a short hike suitable for practically anyone.  The end point of the hike is a secluded two tier waterfall which drops about 12 and 8 ft.  Most of the trail is an old track presently used by ATVs.  The trail has some large puddles to circumvent as you pass through a mixed forest.  There are multiple ATV tracks and intersections along the way so you may want to look closely at my gps track.  Towards the end of the hike the trail goes up a small hill and into a large cleared off area.  Signs of a small fire ring can be seen.  From this point drop off into the small valley in front of you.  There is a small easy to recognize trail leading you down a very steep slope.  The ground is soft and so be careful as you make your way down the small hill.  At the bottom you should hear the roar of the fall as it is partially hidden by a rock wall.  You can easily climb the first fall and then you have a little pond to soak in and admire the second fall.",
    "directions": "Highway 105 on the other side of the river from Woodstock.  Drive North towards McKenna and turn right on Jennings Rd.  follow this rd until it becomes too narrow for a car and start walking?.",
