    "description": "Well maintained trails that lead through Thetis Lake Park from the end of Stewart Mt Road.  Follow signs towards Westoby Road.  You will pass several trails on the left, all of which lead to Scafe Hill.  Just before Westoby take the trail to the left. This section can be a bit wet. Soon after you start to head uphill you will come to a fork.  Stay left at the fork. Soon you will pass a small trail on the left but this dead ends quickly. Take the next left. Today an arbutus tree had fallen right across the steepest section of the trail but you could still get around quite easily and then pick the trail back up.  Once at the top (go off the trail on to the rocks for a bit) you get a view of Mt Finlayson, Stewart Mt and Bear Mt resort.  As you head downhill from here (do not retrace steps) but head down on the other side of the viewpoint there are several intersecting trails. Take one that heads to the left and you will get to a viewpoint of what I think is Teanook Lake and Matson Lake. Two lakes that are on private property.  We did a small loop here and then headed back down (again no retracing steps) until the trail met up with the main trail that you came in on. Once back at this trail go right and you will be back at the car. Left will take you back to Westoby Road",
    "directions": "Drive up millstream road. Turn right on Stewart Mt Road.  It is the street past Finlayson Arm Road. Park at the end of the road. Pay attention to where on the road to park to avoid towing.",
