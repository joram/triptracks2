    "description": "Rawson Lake is a beautiful green lake sitting below the sheer cliffs of Mt. Sarrail in Kananaskis Country. The trail starts at the upper Kananaskis Lake parking area and leads off west along the lakeshore. At about 1km (past Sarrail Falls), turn left up the slope. The trail is fairly steep, but only for about 1.5km.Once at the lake you can fish, relax or explore. Some have gone up the grassy slope at the SW corner of the lake. Although very steep, it is short and affords great views back to the lake.Be aware that grizzlies have been spotted at the south end of the lake. Watch for pikas in the rocks as you walk around the lake.NTS Map: 082J11Elevation Gain: 305 m (1,000 ft).",
    "directions": "Park at the upper Kananaskis Lake parking area and take the trail to the west (left).",
