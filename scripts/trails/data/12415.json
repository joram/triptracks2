    "description": "This track allows you to turn the Popular South Buller Pass Trail into a loop by connecting to the little known North Pass.  To access the North Pass turn left immediately after the third bridge on the South Buller Trail. Follow this pass all the way to the end and climb up the steep ridge at the end. Once you drop down the backside of this ridge you'll be treated to some nice Grassy ridgewalking. You'll then want to reconnect with the trail going down South Buller pass and Climb up the backside of the pass until your back on the well marked South Buller Pass. This loop should end up being 15-17km and about 7-8 hours",
