    "description": "Paddling from Tillicum Bay to Nine Mile Point Camp is an easy day trip or overnight weekend get-a-way. It is also the start to a week long journey exploring Salmon and Narrows Inlet. You will pass a few houses to begin with, followed by oyster farms, then wide open nature. Sechelt Inlet is protected waters ocean paddling, so no open ocean swells. Take care to note the tides and winds. Paddle in the morning when winds are calmest. The winds come from the south and head north, also flow out of Salmon and Narrows Inlet. \r\rThere are few boats on this water, most of them working boats that supply the aquaculture industry. Plus there are not as many yahoos as on Indian Arm.",
    "directions": "From Hwy 101, head north towards Porpoise Bay PP, but continue north to Tillicum Bay. Lauch at Peddles and Paddles.",
