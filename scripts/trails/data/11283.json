    "description": "Each year I spend some time in Chipman due to work.  On a morning run I was pleasently surprised when I found a few trails set in woodland right next door to the Irving Lumber facility.  The trails are quite wide and lead you all the way to the back channel on the Salmon River.  There is lots of eveidence of beaver actoivity as you get close to the channel.   The forest is mostly these very old and tall pine trees.  I sptted some herons on the water's edge as well.",
    "directions": "Highway 10 to Chipman.  Just before the lumber facility and before the small bridge over the Henderson Brook.  there is a small sign with the park's name which unfortunately I have forgotten (help please!).  Drive down the small dirt road to a parking area.",
