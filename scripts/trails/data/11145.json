    "description": "Loop hike from Ruckle Provincial Park, on the southern end of Salt Spring Island in the Gulf Islands. Well marked trail leads from the campground through a farm and up over a high knoll. The trail continues through the forest to the ocean. The trail then follows the water, with several opportunities to visit beaches. Some sections are a tad rugged, but not difficult. Not for flip-flops, though! Lots of wildlife including mule deer, bald eagles, turkey vultures, otters and seagulls.",
    "directions": "Follow signs from Fulford or Ganges to Ruckle Provincial Park. The trailhead is located about 50 metres west of the farm entrance (and self-serve farm stand). Alternately, you can start at the campground and head west past Grandma Bay to the farm.",
