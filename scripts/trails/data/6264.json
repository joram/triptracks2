    "description": "This is one of the more famous trails in the Crawford Trail Network in Myra-Bellview Park.  Vapour is a natural downhill trail, with only a few climbs.  It's fast and flowy in the middle, with the upper and lower portions being a little more technical.  While there are no man-made stunts, there are some sweet rock drops and sandy and rocky chutes that make the trail challenging.  There are sign posts at most major intersections, allowing tons of other trails to be linked together.  Vapour is not for the novice riders, but advanced skills are not required either.  Pass through open meadow areas, forests and the remains of the Okanagan Mountain fire.",
    "directions": "There are ride up options, but with a DH bike, shuttling is the way to go.  Drive up Chute Lake Road (2wd able, but you may need good driving skills).  When you reach the Kettle Valley Railway at the top, hang a right for about 2 kms.  You will pass the trail head for Nemo (recognizable by the orange metal ladder over the barbwire fence and the map and signpost at the top).  Vapour is harder to miss because there is no obvious marked trail head, but its the next trail off to the right after Nemo.  You will (can) finish at the power station at the end of Stewart Rd. East.",
