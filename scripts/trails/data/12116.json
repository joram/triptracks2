    "description": "This is a hike to seldom seen falls in the middle nowhere in the egg mountains of Nova Scotia.  I had a hunch that some falls would be located on this brook as the topo maps showed a rapid plunging ravine to the main branch of the brook.Setting off from the logging road, the forest is simply amazing.  Mature beech, maple and birch created a high canopy and below only ferns impede your walk.   What a beautiful sight of an Acadian type forest.  soon, you descend into the ravine and the many many falls start.Unfortunately none of them are higher than 10ft but there are a lot of them making this trip worthwhile.",
    "directions": "Highway 245 north of Antigonish.  Turn on Clydesdale Rd and then on Peasant Valley Rd.  Turn left on Connors Mountain Rd and park near where the brook crosses the logging road at 45.718386, -62.137199",
