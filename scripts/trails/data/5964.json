    "description": "BC Ferries Swartz Bay Terminal to Victoria, BC, via Lochside Trail by bicycle. BC Ferries Swartz Bay Terminal is located 33km north of the City of  Victoria, BC, Canada. Much of this trail is actually just the Lochside Drive roadway, but most of the distance is dedicated, multi use, paved trail. \nSome sections are smoothly-packed gravel. The majority of the roadway  sections do not have cycling lanes. This report outlines the Lochside Trail route travelling southbound toward the city from the ferry and the GPS track only covers the first part to get one onto Lochside Drive. If one cannot follow the Lochside Trail into Victoria once established southbound upon Lochside Drive at Tulista Park in Sidney-by-the-Sea, may I suggest your next outing be no farther than the corner store.\nGPS Coordinates Kittiwake Plc. and Curteis Rd: 48\u00b040'56.06\"N  123\u00b024'41.83\"W",
    "directions": "After disembarking the BC Ferry at the Swartz Bay Terminal, follow the  cycling lanes to the Lands End Road overpass. The Lochside Trail is  located on the eastside of Hwy 17 -- that is, to one's lefthand side of the  highway. Follow the Lochside Trail signage to Sidney, BC and then  continue to Victoria, BC, on Lochside Drive (roadway).",
