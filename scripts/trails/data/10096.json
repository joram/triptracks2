    "description": "Starting with 432m of steady, unrelenting climbing in 6km and ending with some truly cool descents over rock slabs and vista filled faces, this 10.6km ride makes for a great afternoon.\r",
    "directions": "Anywhere from 0.5 to 1.4km East of the Lac Des Arcs overpass, park on the South side of the hiway #1.  Follow the GPS track attached, and most people do the trail counter-clockwise.\r\rNot sure about the legality of parking in the ditch??  But make sure it is a safe location.  You can also probably park in the Heart Creek trailhead and you'll be close too.",
