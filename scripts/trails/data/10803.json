    "description": "A short trail south of Digby takes you along the Acacia brook to a small waterfall.  The trail is mostly on the side of the brook and through a mixed forest.  Some benches are set near the stream for a rest.  The waterfall at the end of the trail is small but picturesque and a wide deck had been constructed at this point on the side of the brook.",
    "directions": "Digby.  Take the Acacia Valley Rd which becomes Ridge Road.  Turn left on Mill Rd.  Park at the end of the Mill Rd just after passing over a small bridge.  The trail follows the brook in a downstream direction.",
