    "description": "This biking trail takes you in and out of wooded trails and on and off power lines.  It goes through sand pits and bogs, although most can be by-passed.  There are several side trails that provide more choices.  The start of the trail is the Esso station in French Village.  From there you can access the power lines and then the other trails.",
    "directions": "Start at the Esso station in French Village just east of Saint John.  From the Esso station go east then north on side streets until you access the power lines.",
