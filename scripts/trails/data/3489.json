    "description": "The First Lake Trail is located in the Mount Seymour Provincial Park, immediately adjacent to the Mount Seymour Ski Resort.  While just a short little trip, the trail is nicely nestled into the mountainside, giving the hiker/snowshoer the illusion of being much farther away from the city than they actually are!\nGreat for first-time snowshoers, or people just looking for a quick break in the forest.",
    "directions": "Drive up the Mount Seymour access road, and park as close to the end of the parking lot as possible.  Hike past the Seymour Provincial Park info kiosk/pagoda, and head up the trail on the far left of the ski runs.  Look or the sign indicating the trailhead about 100m up this path.  Either start here or continue up the trail parallelling the ski run for another ~400m to the next junction, where the 1st Lake Trail joins yet again.",
