    "description": "A loop which follows in part the historic CPR trail from Cameron Lake.  Since the blowdown of 2019, the trail has been redirected in places and has become a prime example of the damage a windstorm can do...you are walking through an area that was inaccessible after the windstorm until the trail was restored.  Thanks to BR and TM for that!  A nice 4 season accessible loop with several viewpoints, and an option to continue to Mt. Cokely.  The loop is approx. 1000m elevation gain",
    "directions": "Across Highway 4 from the eastern picnic area at Cameron Lake.  There is a small green hiking trail sign.  Parking at picnic area",
