    "description": "NTS Map: 082O03\nThere are a number of different trail options but my favorite is the east to west ridge route.  From the kiosk in the parking lot walk for about ten minutes and take your first right. There are a few offshoots along the way but if you stick to the most well travelled path you will break through treeline and begin climbing the east ridge. From here the hike becomes an easy scramble involving some use of hands and a bolted on cable to traverse a short ledge. Choose the path of least resistence and watch for loose or falling rocks on your way to the summit.\nTake a minute to sign the summit log before heading down the west ridge and enjoying a great scree run. From here on I have no trail description because we were hit with a sudden hail storm and had to hurry below treeline. \nThe GPS coords should be accurate until the saddle on the west ridge. From there on there is no trail.",
