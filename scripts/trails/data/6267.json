    "description": "This trail starts up a tree cut line for about 4km.  Then a short switch back up thru the trees.  Once out of the trees its all up hill for what seems like for ever.  It's not technical but just a steep incline grassy slope.  Once up at the top there is a nice view down the valley overlooking Ekshaw.  It was pretty cloudy the day we did it, but you can probally see quite a ways east (Pigeon is right near the begining of the mountain range).I would advise against trying to run down hill on the way back.  One of the people in our group could barley stop once they got going (although it was pretty funny).",
    "directions": "Heading to canmore on the trans Canada and the Dead Mans Flats intersection head south 1 to 1.5km to the trail head.",
