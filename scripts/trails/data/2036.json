    "description": "This is a nice and easy trail, perfect for those who are out to catch some fresh air and relax, for joggers and bikers. Since the trail follows the Coquitlam River, a sound of the purling water accompanies you all the way to the Crystal Falls, even when you are deeper in the forest. \r\n\r\nIf you decide to take this trail in September, as we did, you will be rewarded with magical autumn colours, and joyful play of sunlight and shadows through the tree branches. There is no pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, but there are Crystal Falls at the end of the trail, with clear water sliding down the wet and shiny rocks. It is a perfect spot for a break, before you turn back, or continue to Burke mountains.\r\n\r",
    "directions": "Drive up the Shaughessey Street in Port Coquitlam until you get to its end at Karley Cres. The whole area is under development, but this is as far as you can go. The entrance to the trail, going down to the Coquitlam river bank, is not marked, except for the blue sign, which says \"\"MOTORIZED VEHICLES INCLUDING MOTORBIKES PROHIBITED\"\"",
