The trail difficulty has been rated as extreme because of an elevation gain of 1100m in the first 6 km.  You are rewarded with an excellent view at the top of the pass.  The descent into Landslide Lake is very steep.  The lake has rainbow trout so come prepared.  Like everywhere in the David Thompson area there are no defined campsites but please think of others.
