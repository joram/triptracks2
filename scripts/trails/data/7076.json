    "description": "Bat Lake Trail is a 5.7 km loop in Algonquin Provincial Park.  The information at the trailhead and the trail guide suggest that this trail takes 3.5 hours to complete.  I completed the trail with my two children in 2 hours (including 30 minutes of stopped time to enjoy the lookout and Bat Lake).  The trail slowly climbs from the trailhead past a river before it reaches a lookout.  It is not the most spectacular lookout in Algonquin, but nice all the same.  The trail then slowly descends and crosses a bog before reaching Bat Lake.  The lake has two small docks from which you can take in the view.  The trail then crosses the same bog as earlier before returning to the trailhead.",
    "directions": "The trailhead is located at kilometre 30 on Highway 60 which crosses the southern part of Algonquin Provincial Park",
