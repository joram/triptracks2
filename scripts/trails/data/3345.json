    "description": "A great place to get a warmup lap on the Fox Mtn trails.  It's less than an hour your first time down, and under 15 minutes on subsequent laps.  The original trail was \"decommissioned\" briefly a few years ago, and all the admittedly rickety stunts were pulled down.  Upon reflection, the community and various levels of govt. reopened the trail and have built all new Whistler standards stunts on the trail.  Nothing buge, but excellent fun.  Sort flat with some ramps and logs near the top, and a bermed gully with mid-sized jumps lower down.  Everything has a way around.",
    "directions": "Fox Mtn Rd joins with Hwy 97 just north of town.  This is the base of the trail.  There's a bit of a cul-de-sac, just don't block anyones driveway.To get to the top of the trail.1.  First left on Eider Rd.2. Right on Gannet Rd.3. Left on Murre Rd.  Trail is at the end of the road, and is clearly marked.Red Shred's Bike and Board at the end of 1st downtown has maps and is a good place to hook up locals for rides.",
