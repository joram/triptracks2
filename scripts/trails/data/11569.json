    "description": "Nice back country cruising along varied trails with some steep climbs on dirt and gravel trails, combined with a bit of beautifully smooth paved bike paths.  Not overly technical but has its moments scurrying through the loose terrain, and a great workout that can be nicely rewarded with a several options for a cold beer on a riverside patio at the end of the ride.Bring bug spray if you're doing this ride in July or earlier.  Mosquitoes can be brutal in the deep wooded sections, but as long as you keep moving, you'll be ok.",
    "directions": "This trail connects to the very well maintained and well mapped NCC bike bath network (http://www.ncc-ccn.gc.ca/places-to-visit/parks-paths/things-to-do/cycling-capital-pathways), so you can get to on awesome city bike paths from pretty much anywhere in Ottawa or Gatineau.  I started my GPS mapping on the path behind the Civilization Museum.  Alternatively, you can park at P3, off the Promenade de la Gatineau, at the  base of Gatineau Park, if you want to bypass the city altogether.",
