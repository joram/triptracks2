    "description": "A short hike to a fall close to the TCH on Boularderie Island.   This is a fall I last visited in 2006 or so.  There might be a trail to it by now.  If not just head into the woods off the road and go upstream on the brook.  The fall is a nice triangular shape and about 20ft.   It's easy to get to and not very far from the road.",
    "directions": "TCH  to Big Harbour Rd.  follow the road to approx  46\u00b013'36.55\"N,  60\u00b030'56.78\"W and head upstream",
