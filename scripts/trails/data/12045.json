    "description": "This trail goes off to the East of the lake and up the ridge. Beautiful views from the top, and fewer people than the main trail. There are a few rocky/steep sections which will be slippery in the rain.When walking up towards the lake from the parking lot, cross the road and go into the forest on the trail that goes off to your right. The trail continues, at times it is a bit faint and there are lots of smaller trails branching off. Continue over a rocky area, then to the left and over the bridge. From here you go right on the trail. It becomes steep as it goes along the hill and then turns and goes up and over onto the top. You will see the plaque with the trail name on a rock on your left. Beautiful views from the top. The trail continues and turns and goes left, taking you back down the hill to join the main trail along the lake.",
    "directions": "Thetis lake is at the North end of 6 mile road. Follow signs from the #1 Highway or from the Old Island Highway.",
