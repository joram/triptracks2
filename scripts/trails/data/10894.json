    "description": "Hiking to Three Brothers Lookout will make for a long but enjoyable day hiking in the Washington Teanaway Region.  You'll get views of the Stuart Range and plan for other hikes in the area like Navaho, Earl, Bean, and Miller.  Best in Summer, and you'll find adequate water you can treat.",
    "directions": "I-90 east to Cle Elum, Hwy 97 north to Teanaway Road then look for Beverly Creek Trailhead.",
