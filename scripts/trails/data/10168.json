    "description": "Downtown ride.  Credit for this ride goes to Sergio who was first to put me on to it.  Here are his original words:\r\rSome Tips: #1- Do it in counter clockwise course. The Stanley Park's seawall lane has one-way bike route (from Coal Harbour to English bay); #2- Never ride alone in Gastown area (especially at night) unless you?re looking for crack. The druggies and are mostly harmless but can they look intimidating to tourists; #3- Sometimes you need to ride on shared lane in the street. The drivers are very friendly there, but take care anyway. #4- Do not forget to have fun.",
