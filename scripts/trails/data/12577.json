    "description": "This trail is part of the Oregon Coast Trail and is signed as such. This trail is described from the North Trailhead, but can also be done from the South trailhead as a shorter trail or as a loop hike from one trailhead to the other and then linked up using the highway. The trail is very clear and easy to follow.",
    "directions": "Heading South on Highway 101 from Cannon Beach, enter Oswald West State Park and continue until you cross a small bridge over Necarney Creek. Less than 500 m after this bridge, there is a pullover on the West side of the highway where you can park and the North trailhead for the trail is just on the East side of the highway.",
