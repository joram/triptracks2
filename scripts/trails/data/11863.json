    "description": "Hiking to Beautifull Hanging Lake.While Hanging Lake may be a geologic wonder, its popularity with Colorado travelers has more to do with its awe-inspiring beauty. Suspended on the edge of Glenwood Canyon's cliffs, the clear turquoise lake and the waterfall that spills into it are a breathtaking sight after the uphill climb. The stocked lake is teeming with native trout, but don't think about bringing fishing gear or even your dog, both are strictly prohibited on this hike. Instead, bring your camera to capture memories of this photogenic site",
    "directions": "The Hanging Lake trail-head is located approximately 10 miles east of Glenwood Springs along Interstate-70 in Glenwood Canyon. The trail follows Dead Horse Creek, with foot bridges spanning the creek along the way. If the trail seems a little rigorous, hikers can take a break at one of many convenient rest spots. - See more at: http://www.visitglenwood.com/hanging-lake#sthash.lqd6XRa3.dpuf",
