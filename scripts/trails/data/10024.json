    "description": "This trail starts off as a trail following the rocky shores of Matheson Lake.  It then takes of on a secluded side trail to Roach Cove.  This trail follows a stream through a mature forest down to the coast similar to Goldstream park.  The canopy and deep valley makes for poor GPS reception as seen in the track.   The route goes back on the other side of the lake and ends in a sandy beach that would be nice to cool off and swim in in summer.",
