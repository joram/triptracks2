    "description": "The area known as the Cranberry Marsh is a part of a provincially significant wetland complex.  The Cranberry Trail is a linear and flat trail with no elevation gain traversing the cranberry marsh.  The surface is hard packed and is accessible for hikers and those confined to wheelchairs.  The end of the trail opens up to a vista of Lake Nipissing situated north of the peninsula and island chain that divides Callander Bay from the main body of the lake.  The trail is well marked and extremely well maintained.",
    "directions": "The Access Point is at the end of Cranberry Road, north of Callander.  It is 1.71 km west of the Pinewood Park Drive / Cranberry Road intersection.  I drove there today and there is a jog in the road, do not turn left at the end of Cranberry Road, instead go straight on to the trailhead.",
