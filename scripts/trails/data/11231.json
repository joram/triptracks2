    "description": "Short hike through a mixed forest on a dedicated path to a bouldering area.  The thing that caught my eye on this one was the mention of caves..it turned out that the caves are made up of large boulders on top of each other....fun nonetheless.  The bouldering area offers a lot of problems and two of the boulders are positively huge!  The hardest thing is to find the railhead but even if you miss it, you will encounter the path once you enter the forest.  As the name suggest some of the smaller caves do contain porcupines so watch out!",
    "directions": "St margarets Bay Rd.  Turn on highway 329 and drive all the way to the northwest cove Lake....the bouldering area is to the NE of the lake...see the gpx entry.",
