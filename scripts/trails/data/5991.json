    "description": "An all season walking/hiking and biking trail loop along both sides of the  north side of the North Saskatchewan River (NSR) from  the Groat Bridge  in the north to the foot bridge between Hawrelak and Sir Wilfred Laurier  Parks to the south.  Enter the loop at any of the three entry points and  complete the trail in either direction.  There are several places to stop and rest or picnic at view point benches, trail entry areas and throughout the route through Hawrelak Park.  There are also several benches and picnic tables that are scattered west of entry point 2 and at entry point 1 in Emily Murphy Park.  Overall the trail is moderately undulating and will \nrequire climbing out of the river valley once.",
    "directions": "From downtown Edmonton head west along Jasper Avenue to 116 street  and turn left.  Travel south to the Victoria Park Road and turn right and head down the hill to the west.  At the bottom of the hill track south (left) and continue across the Groat Bridge and follow the signs to the University of Alberta.  Then follow the signs to Emily Murphy Park.  If driving, park here, and walk either under the Groat Bridge to complete  the loop clockwise or head up a short set of stairs to cross the Groat  Bridge to complete the loop in the other direction.",
