    "description": "NTS Map: 082J14Troll Falls trail is part of a network of cross country ski trails which double as hiking trails in the summer. They are located in Kananaskis Country near the base of the Nakiska downhill ski hil which was built for the 1988 Olympic Winter Games. The Troll Falls trail is an easy trail to a nice waterfall. Enjoyable in any season, it follows the ski trails for most of the way, then branches off for the final kilometer. Elevation gain is minor. You can return the same way or keep left at the first fork (returning) and follow the trail along the Kananaskis River.",
    "directions": "The trailhead is located just off (right) of the Nakiska road about a half mile from highway 40 in Kananaskis. Look for 'Stoney Trailhead' sign.",
