    "description": "This is an easy hike with nothing technical and slow and steady elevation gain. It's an official Parks Canada Trail so it is well maintained and easy to keep on track and there are a lot of people. The only difficulty for some may be the distance, with close to 20 km round trip. It is a wonderful hike with rewarding views of the many lakes and peaks surrounding the pass: The Monarch, Pharaoh and Mount Ball to name the highest and most impressive peaks.From Sunshine's Village parking lot, take the trail in the back of the building for less than 1 km and you'll see a sign on your right for Healy Pass. From now on, it will be well indicated. My GPS track is accurate, but we went up the ridge on the left side of the pass to have a lunch and better views. It was about 500 metres and some 50 metres elevation on top of the actual trail. Elevation of 689 m NET, 701 m TOT and max 2361 m4 to 7 hours",
    "directions": "From Banff, drive west on Trans-Canada Highway and take the exit toward Sunshine Village. Drive up to the main parking lot and find the trail behind the gondola station.",
