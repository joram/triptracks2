    "description": "This is a short hike to a waterfall right in the middle of the city....kind of anyways.  the fall is located in the Blue Mountain wilderness Area just off the Kearney Lake Rd.  the trail is set in a mixed forest and climbs a small hill at first before levelling out for a while until you get to the Hobsons Lake.  Close to the lake, turn to the right side trail and follow it until you reach a small brook flowing out of the lake.  The falls are just downstream of this.  they are a series of drops and make sure you visit them after some rain as they may go dry in summer.I followed the brook down and then saw some wood structures.  I went to investigate and found at least 4-5 old tree houses and a whopping zip line across the valley.  not sure how long that zip line has been there but it is made from some pretty heavy duty cable.",
    "directions": "Kearney Lake Rd, turn on Belle St/Collins Rd and park at the end.  From here there are lots of trailheads.  Hobsons Lake trailhead is the one at the top of the small cliffs on your right",
