    "description": "Sleeping Giant offers fabulous views of the Kaua?i coast.  The trail is steep in some sections and quite exposed -- take lots of water; the heat is more challenging than the grades. There's a bit of a scramble at about a 1/2 mile in -- don't let it deter you as it's the only tough spot on the official trail. The only negatives are the trip hazards that have been created by small trees that have been cut 3 - 5\" above the surface; and the lack of trail markers.The best of the trail happens beyond the \"End Of Trail\" marker. There's an easy (narrow) trail with a bit of a climb up a rock face that takes you to the most rewarding views.",
