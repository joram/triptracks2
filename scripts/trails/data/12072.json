    "description": "Headwall Lakes starts from the Chester Lake Trailhead. Take the SE exit from the Trailhead and follow a well-marked trail crossing a creek where an old bridge is still visible under the flood debris. The trail then switches right and up the hill where at the top of the hill you'll see a cairn on the left, 3 KM out.Follow this trail through the trees where you?ll find new trail which detours around the flood damaged old trail.The new trail ends at rock scree, after which you continue on the original trail up over three moraines, before getting to the Upper Headwall Lake.The Lower Headwall Lake is above the second Moraine from where you can first see the Karst Falls coming out of the third moraine. The trail top the upper lake is to the right side of this falls.",
    "directions": "Take the Smith-Dorrien Highway, off of Highway 40 to the Chester Lake Trailhead. The Headwall Lakes trail starts in the SE corner of the parking lot.",
