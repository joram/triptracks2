    "description": "Easy loop trail in Derby Reach regional park. Unlike most other trails in Langley, the Houston Trail is completely forested for the entire route and is more of a rolling track than the typical perfectly flat Langley trail.",
    "directions": "From downtown Fort Langley, follow 96th Avenue west from Glover Road for 1.5km. At a curve in the road, turn right on to McKinnon Crescent. Continue straight for 1.2km, passing a 'no exit' sign before turning right into the gated trailhead parking area.\r\rAlternatively, 96th Avenue can be followed east from 200th Street on the north side of the freeway (Walnut Grove area) to McKinnon Crescent.",
