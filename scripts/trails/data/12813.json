    "description": "The trail starts with a steady climb to top of the ridge then levels off. Follow ATV tracks and walk toward the broad peak that has cliffs on one side, then climb to top where possible. Very scenic 360 degree views of surrounding ridges and can see as far as Monkman Peak. Can continue walking along the ridge or follow the ATV tracks to nearby alpine lakes (visible from the top). For more information, see Wolverine Nordic and Mountain Society pamphlet: cowmoose2017.pdf.",
    "directions": "From Tumbler Ridge, drive north on highway 29 for 25 km, turn left onto Bullmose Mine Road (paved), then follow blue hiking trail sign and turn right onto gravel road. Drive for 5 km, park before the bridge. Trailhead is on the left (blue sign).",
