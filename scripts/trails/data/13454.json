    "description": "*** Parks Canada pass required.\n\nThis is a very easy double trackset & skating trail with pretty much no elevation, perfect for beginners. The first part of the trail goes back and forth 4 times with nice views of Mount Bourgeau, Rundle, Cascade and Inglismaldie. Then it goes up to the right to Village I for a more interesting trail through the forest.",
    "directions": "From Calgary, follow Trans-Canada Highway/AB-1 W and take the exit toward Banff/Tunnel Mountain. Turn left onto Banff Avenue and drive for 1 km, then turn left on Tunnel Mountain Rd and continue for 4.5 km. Turn right to the Tunnel Mountain campground and the parking will be on your right just after the gate.\u2003",
