    "description": "This moderate hiking trail east of Duncan, BC, follows the ridge of Mt. Tzouhalem, providing 180 degree views of Cowichan Bay and Duncan. You'll be able to see Mt. Whymper, Mt. Prevost and the Malahat. The summit of the route has a big cross erected by the church below. It's a good place for a picnic.  Be aware that mountain bikes also share parts of this trail.\nNote: The GPS track was taken with +/-5m accuracy and should be easy to follow.",
