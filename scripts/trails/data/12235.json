    "description": "This is another spot that is largely unknown.  I also spotted some weird spots on GE and decided to check it out at the same time as the Brook Hill Fall nearby.The walk on an old logging rd was easy and then I found the stream in a small ravine.  I followed it to a 20ft fall.  However, the area downstream of the fall is again surrounded by these cliffs with some weird rock formations....very cool!.    The way back was basically following a contour line all the way to the road.  there is some flagging tape from some logging that you can also follow.",
