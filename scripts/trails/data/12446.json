    "description": "The trail starts just off the highway where you'll travel along a gravel road with a steady incline for about 1.5 Km.  After this, the trail to Flood mountain will veer off to the left turning into a maintained ATV road. This path continues for about 6.5 Km, a series of ups and downs through the trees. at around the 8 Km mark, you'll hit an intersection where the ATV path continues straight, another path opens up to going down to the left, and the Flood Mountain path breaks off to the right with a steep incline. this section of steep incline will continue for about 1 Km until you break out of the treeline. once out, you're not far from the summit, just follow the path for another few hundred meters. There are some decent views from the summit if there's fair weather.",
    "directions": "The directions to the trail head are from the Passport to the Peaks Guidebook.  \"From the tourism center, drive south on highway 40 for 10.1 Km. The Flood mountain trail head is on the north (left) side of the highway, just before the bridge over the train tracks. Park your vehicle and proceed up.\"There will be a yellow sign the says \"Flood Mountain 0\", this is where you park.",
