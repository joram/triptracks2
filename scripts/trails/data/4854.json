    "description": "There are a number of trails around Mount Desert and Acadia National Park. You must consider the tides on these runs.\nBartlett Island: The idea on this trip, was to go from Pretty Marsh put in follow the rising tide around the Hub then come down the windward side of Bartlett (NO wind that day). Then go onto Hardwood Island and  Moose Island. Taking out at Sealcove. Unfortunately no wind means fog, lots of it. Even with GPS on the boats we were not comfortable in crossing Bartlett to Hardwood, with an ebbing tide. So we came back to our put in.\nSomes Sound: Again a rising tide and it's turn. From the harbour of Manset, looking around the boats of Southwest Harbour and through the narrows of Somes Sound. Bald Eagles, fox relaxing on the rocks, fogs making everything surreal.\nClarck Cove: From Pretty Marsh follow the coast all the way to Clarck Cove. Tons of seals playing with us and a few dolphins for good luck. Many islands to have lunch but be careful some of them are private, ask permission like we did and the owners were very accommodating.\nThe Porcupines: The one everybody goes on, from the town of Bar Harbor along it's islands, this can get quite windy. I prefer it as a sunset run, then you can enjoy the many restaurants around the town.",
    "directions": "All puts ins are well indicated on pretty much all maps of the island.",
