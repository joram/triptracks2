    "description": "Follow a steep trail at the south end of the pullout (with the assistance of a usefully placed rope) and cross the outlet of a lake, before getting onto an easy trail on the right side of the creek. The trail climbs along cascading waterfalls for at least 4.5 km. Only the first kilometre is actually in Canada, but there is no sign indicating that you crossing the border, unless you look at your GPS! We continued beyond the well travelled trail until we could look down into the Chilkoot Trail valley, with impressive views of glaciers on the other side.",
    "directions": "Heading south of Carcross on the Klondike Highway, continue into British Columbia and 12 km past Canada Customs and park in the pullout on the right, just past a couple of outhouses on the left. If you cross the actual International Boundary you have gone a few hundred metres too far!",
