    "description": "An alternate route into the Sandy Cove - Salvage 'Old Trail' system.  This trail is fairly overgrown but you will find 3 old overgrown cemetaries and several other interesting relics of days gone by.  If you like rugged hiking, DO this trail and if you want a lot of rugged, do the 12km from Sandy Cove to Salvage (also on trailpeak).\nThere are a number of T intersections back in there, most of them well signed but you'll want to be a little brave to tackle these trails.  Be careful, you may trip over an old gravestone, please respect this area and tread carefully.",
    "directions": "Go to Salvage. East on hiway 310 from the #1 about 60km South of Gander, past the top edge of Terra Nova National Park.\nFollow the main road into town and look for the museum (white 2 story house) on the right near the edge of town (before you get into Metro Salvage ;)  Park there and start up past the house just behind and to the right of the museum.  Look for Red and white striped trail marker signs.",
