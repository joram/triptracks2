    "description": "The cross country ski and single track bike trails are located on a hill-like land form deposited by glacial activity more than 14,000 years ago. The moraine is also made up of granite boulders, brought there by the glacier.  Eight thousand (8,000) years ago this area was the shore of glacial Lake Agassiz and as a result is covered in sand.  Trails tend to be sand covered, and can be somewhat unstable when dry, but dry quickly after a rain. Cyclists will experience moderate elevation changes.   Some sections of the trails are covered with rocks (The Rock Gardens) and will be difficult for novice riders, but no problem walking through these sections.  There is lots of fast flowing single track, which is fun for riders of all levels. The trails are located within the Grand Beach Provincial Park, so a Manitoba Provincial Park pass is required.",
    "directions": "Leaving Winnipeg, take Provincial Trunk Highway (PTH) 59 north, 80 km/49.7 mi. to the Grand Beach turnoff. Follow PTH 12 west 6 km./3.7 mi. Enter the park on at the east entrance, follow the signs to the ski parking lot and trail head (about 2 km north of PTH#12.",
