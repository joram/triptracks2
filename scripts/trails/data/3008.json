    "description": "Eagle Hill - Hike number 337 in Gillaen Daeffern's Kananasksis Country trail guide volume 2.\r\n\r\nThere are multiple marked trails that can be used to access Eagle Hill trail. We started by doing the Deer Ridge trail to the junction of the cut line and Eagle hill Trail Junction, on the return we used the Sibbald flats trail to avoid low wet section of the marked Eagle hill trail.\r\n\r\nTrail goes up and down, it's only 250 meters up but you do it several times so total elevation gain for the day was 700 meters.\r\n\r\nTop of Eagle Hill has great mountain views to the west towards the trans Canada Highway.\r\nOn the way up there are views of Moose mountain and Cox hill.\r\n\r\nIt's not a difficult hike but snow also clears earlier than higher elevation trails\r\n\r\nGPS data is for access via Deer Ridge trail or Sibbald Flats",
