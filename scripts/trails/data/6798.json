    "description": "Snake Mountain, 1287 feet (392m), is located at the border of Addison and Weybridge town in Vermont State. This mountain is an isolated mountain and its name is derived from serpentine shape of its long ridge.\r\r When weather is nice, we can see beautiful and excellent view of Adirondacks, Champlain Valley and Lake Champlain from the top of the mountain. We're allowed to bring leashed dog.\r\r  There are mainly 2 trails at Snake Mountain which both starts from the same trailhead.",
    "directions": "The parking lot and trailhead are located at West side of Snake Mountain.\rFrom the junction of Vt 22A and Vt 17 at Addison Four Corners, follow Vt 17 east to a junction on the right with Mountain Rd.  Follow this road south past Whitford Road to a parking lot on the right, about 500 ft. north of the junction with Wilmarth Rd.",
