    "description": "This is a really short hike within the city that leads you to three different waterfalls.Alright waterfall might be a strong word here but these features are about 3ft in height and there are three of them.  I spotted those while I was browsing Google Earth...so there are big enough to create some white spots in the stream.  there is an unofficial trail on the western side of the brook all the way to the third set.  some deadfall to impede you and lots of mud and standing water on it in early March.  I am sure it will dry off by summertime but so will the falls.",
    "directions": "Make your way to eastern passage and then towards Cow Bay.  The brook flows underneath highway 322 (Dyke Rd) at;  44\u00b037'22.95\"N,  63\u00b027'1.09\"W",
