    "description": "This is a hike to an old gold mine adit on the Eastern Shore.   I had the coordinates for it and was driving towards it on the never ending and deeply rutted Lays Lake Rd.  At some point I crossed a small brook and immediately afterward I saw a small ATV path going in the direction I need to go.   I followed it down a significant slope to the shore of Lake Charlotte. All that time going down, I was thinking that the brook next to me must have some waterfalls!At the shore, I followed an ATV path along the lake to the north and got to a scree slope.  above there scree slope lies the entrance to the adit.  Because it is a bat hibernaculum, steel bars have been pit in place to prevent entrance.  On the way back to my car, I was pleasantly suprised by the number of small cascades on that brook.",
    "directions": "Lays Lake road for what feels forever.  the small atv path starts at N44.85022 W62.99598.   Nearby  are awesome adventures on trail peak too!  Look for Salmon river cliffs and fall and the Lake Charlotte fall (http://trailpeak.com/trail-Lake-Charlotte-Waterfall-near-Halifax-NS-11035)",
