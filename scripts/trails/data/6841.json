    "description": "From the parking lot in about 1km.  At this point there is a junction.  Take the left trail (Gorge Creek Trail).  Follow the trail that runs along the creek most of the way.  We had to cross it three times, so I recomend bringing some dry camp shoes and socks (we probally could have hiked around the first two crossings).  The hike is fairly nice gradual climb for the first 7km (110m - light up and down).  The next 3.5km is alot more uphill (about 250m gain).  The last 1.75km is a nice downhill to the campground.  Although there was alot of snow to trudge thu (not good with a heavy pack).  Our hike was in the beginning of June.  The campround is right next to the creek.  There is a bear/rodent hanging pole there aswell.  The out house was pretty tidy.  Not much for fire wood when we were there.  It was probally covered with snow.",
    "directions": "Leave Turner Valley and head weat on Hwy 546.  About 6km past Sandy Mcnabb Campground, turn right on Gorge creek trail.  Follow this road to the end (parking lot).  You can reach Three point campground two ways, this trail is from Gorge creek trail.",
