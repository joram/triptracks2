    "description": "This well marked trail will lead through heavy tree cover toward a tall tall cliff overlooking the Clearwater River. In the last hundred meters or so the trail splits off a few different ways for different views over the edge of the bluffs. The trail is appropriate for novice hikers provided they are in decently fit; nearly all 200meters of elevation change happen within approx. 1.5 kilometers, big workout! The trail was clear with the exception of a few fallen trees near the end. Be wary of bears (especially in July), and be prepared for bugs! The trail allows Mtn Bikes, but is primarily a hiking trail.",
    "directions": "Head North on Clearwater Valley Rd from highway 5, follow that toward the Green Mountain Viewing Tower. You will see a dirt road on the left with a sign for the Green Mountain Viewing Tower. Follow that approx. 2/3 of the way up where you will see a yellow gate with a sign for the Whitehorse Bluffs trail, park near the gate.",
