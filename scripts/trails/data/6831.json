    "description": "A very large network of trails with a great combination of technical singletrack through the sweet pine alpine forest.  You can probably make a 60+km ride out of this area without riding the same section twice.  Or you can do 10km if you want.  Overall a great location with a long season as it dries out early.\n\nFrom the parking lot you can go up either side of Cougar Creek.  To the East you can get to a quarry and above the ACC clubhouse along with a cool, technical steep creek crossing.  To the west you can cross across the top of Silver Tip golf course and get to the radio towers above Harvie Heights and some screaming downhill.\n\nIt is easy to get seperated from your friends as there are many junctions in this network, but the good news is, it is hard to get lost, just go downhill and you hit the highway.\n\nThere have been encounters with wildlife on these trails, some ending tragically, so be aware and always, riding with a couple friends is a good idea.",
    "directions": "West from Calgary about 100km to the Benchlands Trail / SilverTip exit in the middle of Canmore.  Follow the exit around to the right then the lights then go left (North) up Benchlands trail about 1.3km.  Take a right on Elk Run Boulevard then an immediate left into the parking lot.",
