    "description": "Diez Vistas Trail - Distance: 14 km.\r\rElevation gain: 440 m.\r\rHigh point: 560 m",
    "directions": "From Coquitlam/Port Moody, ascend Heritage Mountain and follow signs for Anmore. If you find Anmore, you're almost there and there will be signs for Buntzen Lake. Take note of the park hours when you enter Buntzen, as the gate closes for the night. Drive to the lake, and park in the first lot (not the overflow lot) close to the dog offleash area. Directly east of this parking lot is a gated gravel road. Your trail (Polytrichum/Halvor Lunden) starts on the other side of this road, not far from the gate. Two trails start here, make sure you take the one on the left.",
