    "description": "This is a pretty easy trail, with some nice Views of HRM at the end. The first part of the trail is a dirt road. Follow the dirt road to the T intersection and hang a right (the telephone poles will point you in the right direction. You'll understand when you get to them.) Continue down the dirt road. On your left around 350 m you'll see a path cutting off into the woods. Take that path. This trail is a good trail and well used. There are roots and rocks on the trail but nothing too difficult. When you get to the top of the hill you'll have some nice views to enjoy.\rHappy Hiking\r",
