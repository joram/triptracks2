    "description": "The Bass river of five Islands was one of the first brooks I explored for falls a while ago.  The main reason is that there are two falls on the 1:50 000 topo maps.  I visited those and put up a post on trailpeak. Fast forward a decade and now satellite imagery is getting very precise.  I noticed some white spots downstream of the falls I had already been to.  so of course I decided to check those out.  The descent into the ravine is moderate and you can follow a secondary stream which has a 15ft drop.  Once you reach the river, you can either follow it and sometimes get a bit wet or stay on the slope.    The first white spot was just large rapids but the next one at N45\u00b0 27' 24.1\" W64\u00b0 02' 45.7\" had a nice 1ft drop.  Further upstream was another white spot but again just rapids.  finally i reached the best part of the whole river ...a large fall located at; N45\u00b0 27' 41.9\" W64\u00b0 02' 46.0\".  Its the nicest and tallest of all the falls on this river and for a strange reason its not the ones mapped out on the topo maps!  I ended the hike by going back to one of the marked falls which I had been previously and then bushwacked my way to my car.",
