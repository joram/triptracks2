    "description": "I know  guys that session this trail 4 to 7 times in a day, shuttling up and \r\ndown Rosehill Road.  This trail was featured in Torque 3. Locate Rosehill road on a Kamloops map.  Leave a car at the bottom, shuttle to the top turnaround spot just after the water tower and down you go. Keep your eyes open on the way down for alternate routes.  No need to worry, everything ends \r\nup in the same area near the car.  Look for airs, steeps, flume rides down dried up creek beds with banked corners, a banked slalom style spot and a lot of high speed loving.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Attached map shows some other well known riding areas (and not so well known, i.e. a whole series of former dirt-biker gravity bowls that ride one to another, see \"dips\", on map), and Razorback, another trail in the area.  If you do visit, stay on the trails, close all gates, stay off private land.  All these trails are not on private land, but, some riders are \"curious\" and seek out spurs off trail.  Don't do it, or this area is toast.\r\n\nDirections\n\r\nAbove map should help you locate Rosehill Road (near trailerpark on South end of kamloops).  Pretty simple.",
