    "description": "430 hectares of gently rolling hills gives a nice place to ride if you aren't looking for any serious climbs, descents, or twisty singletrack.  Great for MTBeginners.  Some of the sandy areas do require some technical skilz.The sign says this is \"critical wildlife habitat for white-tailed deer\".  There doesn't seem to be a shortage of white-tails so do they need critical habitat?  No matter, there's lots of room for them (right beside the mashed potatoes).There are a good selection of maps throughout the area compliments of the XCSki contingent.Apparently the deer there aren't expecting MTBs with 25W of Halogen headlights to go bombing through there at dusk either, a white-tail & I (now a brown-tail) scared the heck out of each other.  (When I see critters in my periphery I always first think Bear - comes with riding 90% of the time in Kananaskis Co in the foothills).  There is also about 8 GeoCaches in the area as well.",
    "directions": "Go E of Regina on HiWay #1 about 14.2km from the Ring Road/Victoria.  Watch for a service road entrance on the N side of the highway with a sign indicating White Butte Trails and the graphic of an XC skier.  Go 1/2km back W on the service road and turn  for 2.3km until you see the parking area on the left (West).  There is a second parking lot one grid road to the West.",
