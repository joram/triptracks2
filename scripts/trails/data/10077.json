    "description": "A bit of a long hike to get to a simple mountain, but I went in winter and the \rForest Service Roads were snowed in.\r\rThe cool thing was that during winter with snowshoes I had to blaze my \rown trail. So the GPS track is not always on the existing trail.\r\rToilets. Need Northwest Forest Pass to park.",
    "directions": "Exit 47 on I90, go North, turn Left (West) on access road and park in large \r'Pratt Lake Trailhead' lot.",
