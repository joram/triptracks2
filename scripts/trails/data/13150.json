    "description": "Keith Brook has been on my list of places to check out for waterfalls.  an area just downstream of a pond bog looses a lot of elevation quickly according to the 1:10 000 topo maps.  We started on an old logging road and followed as it ent up a hill.  There were some paths to the left off of it and that might be the easier way to assess the falls.We instead just went more or less in a straight line until the top of the hill.  Traversed the hilltop towards the fall area.  The forest is mostly easy to travel through with some deadfalls but nothing crazy.   Once at the pond, we followed it where it empties.  At this point there are numerous cascades as Keith Brook looses about 30ft in a short distance.  On the wayback we followed an ATV trail for a while until we veered off into the woods to meet up with the logging road we started on.  Falls are approximately at; N44.89980\u00b0 W65.06827\u00b0",
    "directions": "Highway 1 from Nictaux towards Bridgetown.  Once you go ver Keith Brook at; N44.90593\u00b0 W65.08199\u00b0, there is a logging road about 100m due west of the bridge.",
