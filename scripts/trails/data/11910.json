    "description": "Fun, fast, and flowy! Great place for an evening ride, and you can do a few laps/loops to make it as long or short as you like. The climb is nice meandering switchbacks on a buffed out trail. The loop includes going up Mad Cow and Swine Flu, and returning on Farside. There is excellent signage with small maps posted at many junctions. There are also multiple options for climbing and descending. Total climb is approximately 300 m to the top and \"the sign you've been waiting for,\" which rewards you with a bench and great views of the town and surrounding valley.",
    "directions": "Head north on highway 3 from town, and just after cross the bridge there is a small gravel parking lot on the left side of the road.",
