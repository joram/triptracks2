    "description": "On the west side of Nova Scotia, waterfalls are few and where some falls used to occur, dams have been constructed.  On the Tusket River near Yarmouth is a place called Tusket falls which no longer has any falls.  However I noticed a place on the topo maps that was called the Gulch!We started on a dirt road off the highway and made our way to the river following it.   Then we followed the stream on a quasi established trail to a narrowing of the river.  There is rock faces on either side and the river does lose some elevation at this point.   The place is no really a fall but its scenic nonetheless and probably good for a tubing run in the summer.",
