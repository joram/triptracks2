    "description": "A beautiful summer hike along 3 alpine glacier feed lakes. Hike along lakes is moderate but hiking up to the glacier is more difficult involving cling on boulders and loose rocks. The upper lake is a 300m elevation gain from the trail head and then another 400m elevation gain to the glacier.",
    "directions": "Take the Sea to Sky highway (99) from Vancouver through Squamish and Whistler and onto Pemberton. Continue on Hwy 99 until the Joffre Lakes provincial park.",
