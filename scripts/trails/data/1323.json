    "description": "I had always wondered why there were so many cars parked along the  south side of the Trans Canada east of Canmore. It's the trailhead for the Heart Creek Trail (easy), for further hiking up the valley beyond the end of the trail (moderate), for a scamble up Heart Mountain (moderate scramble), and for oodles of rock climbing (photo 4). On this day we did the easy hike and watched the climbers, who were the majority of those along the trail. The creek trail is an easy 2-3km stroll with several easy crossings, seven in all, to a small waterfall at the end of the canyon.NTS Map: Elevation Gain: 100 m (328 ft).",
    "directions": "The trailhead is officially just off the Trans Canada highway just east of Lac Des Arcs (follow highway signs - Heart Creek/Lac des Arcs), which is about 14km east of Canmore. The unofficial trailhead is about 400m east where people just pull off the highway.",
