    "description": "At the trailhead sign turn right and follow Bohaker Trail along the coast and to the beautiful 43ft Bohaker Falls. There are paths down to the bottom of the falls. Nice look out spot also at the end of this 2.2 km trail.  There is also another trail, Charlies Trail, which was closed when we were there in early spring. Have to go back another time. Outhouse, guest book and good signage.",
    "directions": "From Hwy 1 to Annapolis Royal turn right to Parkers Cove then left to Delaps Cove. Follow signs to Delaps Cove Wilderness Trail.   There is a parking lot with a sign (picture of Bohaker Falls).  In  winter park here or drive a few kilometers to the trailhead with  another parking lot.",
