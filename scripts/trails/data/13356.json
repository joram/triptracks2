    "description": "*** Annual road closure (highway 532) between December 1 & April 30. \n\nEdwards Rating: II (II) M S \n3.5 to 5.5 hours \nElevation of 719 m NET, 803 m TOT & max 2416 m \nCompleted on June 6, 2020 in dry conditions (a few avoidable snow patches)\nGear: Hiking poles, lots of warm clothes, winds were strong & cold!  \n\n***** \nThis is an easy scramble but route-finding skills may be at use as there are no obvious route all the way up to the summit and multiple good animal trails which can be confusing. That being said, if you have some experience and/or a GPS, there\u2019s nothing to worry about here. We didn\u2019t want to have trouble with our SUV and preferred to park at the beginning of the road leading to the trailhead (GR836545).  \n\nWe walked about 1.7 km on that road and turned left to cross a creek and continued along Mount Livingstone, aiming for the last rocky ridge in sight as it seemed to be a better option than what we\u2019ve read on other trip reports. We went from rock bands-ribs or slabs to another to avoid scree-rubble as much as possible and it made the ascent enjoyable and easier to gain elevation quickly while doing some easy scrambling. We stayed on the ridgeline all along. We then found a few weaknesses to the right side of the first rock band below the false summit. We stayed on the highest point of the ridge as it is almost always the best and safest way to go. The summit block looks impressive but there are multiple ways to scramble up each band. We mostly took it right in the middle where we could find good holds and easy way up. We continued to this huge Cairn which was useful to block extreme cold winds for a snack break. \n\nGoing down, I messed up as I was aiming for the scree slope just before the false summit but we went down west too early and ended up on the right side of that scree gully with no good scree to enjoy an easy descent. We found a weakness in the cliff and rock bands a few metres below and reached the gully to go back to the creek. I strongly recommend that you rather keep going down to the false summit and use the brownish scree for a descent on the left side, below our ascent route.",
    "directions": "From Calgary, take AB-2 South and turn right onto AB-540 West. Drive for 32 km and turn left on AB-22 South. Continue for 14.3 km and turn right on AB-532 West. Drive for 33.7 km and turn left onto Forest Trunk Rd/AB-40 South. Drive 7.9 km and look for the logging road on your left.",
