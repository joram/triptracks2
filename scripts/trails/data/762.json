    "description": "NTS Map:92B5.  Sandstone formations along the river are riddled with potholes, and rapids and waterfalls feed clear pools that are popular swimming areas. \r\n\r\nHiking trails in the 7.28 hectare park are not well marked, but can provide hours of hiking along the river or up hill to the east on one of many small bush trails to intersect with the Galloping Goose Trail and Todd Creek. Heading upstream to the north from the parking lot, the trails boarder on steep cliffs in some areas, requiring caution and good foot wear. Although the water in the pools is inviting, the water moves fairly swiftly and the level can fluctuate rapidly during rain.\r\n\r",
    "directions": "West Coast Highway 14 to Sooke River Road. The parking lot for Sooke Potholes Provincial Park is located at the end of the road.\r\n\r",
