    "description": "Deep in the Highlands of Cape Breton and if you like to do some extreme hiking, you can access a beautiful 80ft plus waterfall.  \r\rSetting off from the logging road, the first few hundred feet are not enjoyable.  The forest is composed of small trees that have grown quite close to each other.  But after only a few minutes, you emerge on the side of an extremely steep sided ravine.  The waterfall is located at the bottom of the ravine.\r\rThe forest on the slope of the ravine is very nice.  It?s a mixture of mature beech and birch trees.  The ground is covered by a deep layer of moss.  Be careful as you go down the ravine?s slope.  The ground underneath the moss is usually some large individual boulders.  As such, numerous holes are hidden from your view and you can easily turn your ankle in those spots.  After making it all the way down, you are rewarded by this beautiful waterfall that cascades down on the pink colored rock wall.\r",
    "directions": "\rIn the Margaree Valley, turn on Fielding Rd and drive up to the top of the Highlands.  Turn left at 5138000.08 m N, 662634.85 m E and continue straight until you park at 5138983.66 m N, 662799.74 m E.  Turn left on the logging road at this point?\r",
