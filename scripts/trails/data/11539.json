    "description": "This trail connects Octopus Islands Marine Provincial Park, Small Inlet Marine Provincial Park, and Granite Bay Main Rd. Lovely hike through the forest to Newton Lake, which has several great swimming rocks and backcountry campsites.",
    "directions": "From Land: Drive to almost the end of Granite Bay Main Rd on Quadra Island. After this I don't know, I think there is a parking lot and a trail head? Please add the info if you know (use the wiki edit below).From Water: Beach at either Wiatt Bay or Small Inlet. Small Inlet Portage Trail  connects the two together (0.5km?) and then connects to the main trail.",
