    "description": "Beautiful hike, up the red rocks. Bring lots of water. It is not difficult (I did it in running shoes). Lots of tourists on the path. At the top you get to a narrow bridge that you can go on (just don't look down-hehe).",
    "directions": "-6 miles from the Dry Creek Vista parking area-The main parking area is located on FR 152. FR 152 is a very rough dirt road so a high clearance vehicle is recommended. You can also take the Chuck Wagon Trail to reach Devil's Bridge by parking at the Dry Creek Vista parking area or by parking on Long Canyon Road",
