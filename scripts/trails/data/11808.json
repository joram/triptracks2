    "description": "Turtlehead Peak in Red Rock Canyon National Park provides breathtaking views of the canyon and Las Vegas skyline. Overall it is a relatively easy hike with some opportunities for scrambling. There is very little shade and high exposure to the heat and sun so plenty of water and sunscreen is required. There are many small variations from the trail but all seem to lead back to where you want to be in the end. Trail was 7.5 km round trip with between 600 to 700 m elevation gain/loss.From start to finish, the trail took us just under 4 hours including approximately 45 minutes at the top. Go early to avoid the heat and crowds. There are countless stop areas and other hikes, long and short, to be enjoyed along the scenic drive. Easily enough to make a full day of it. There is a small fee at the entry gate ($7 USD per car for the day in March 2015) and worth every penny. We didn't see any wildlife but the information board warning of rattlesnakes, scorpions and venomous spiders had us being extra careful of where we stepped.",
    "directions": "Located along the \"Scenic Drive\" of Red Rock Canyon National Park, approximately 25 miles west of Las Vegas. Trailhead is at the Sandstone Quarry pull off, just proceed past the information board and follow the signs.",
