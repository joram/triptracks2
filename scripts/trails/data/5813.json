    "description": "Description: The trail climbs from the parking lot to a meadow on Johnston Creek some 200 m higher in elevation. It follows old roads for most of the way to the summit then narrows for the descent to the meadow.Trail I is generally uphill with a few flat and downhill sections. It ends where the fire road joins it. Return to the parking lot by the same route.Trail 2 starts where Trail I ends, and continues more steeply and relentlessly than Trail 1. Once over the hump, where the trail narrows, you still have some bad comers to negotiate before you reachthe Ink Pots. Coming into the meadows after the long uphill climb through dense forest is like breaking into another world. The Ink Pots, just ahead where the trail ends, are clear greenish pools formed by artesian springs whose water temperature remains at a constant I *C. They make a lovely spot to have lunch before you head back down the trail to the parking lot. The mountains to your right are all part of the Sawback Range; the smooth-faced triangular peak is Mount Ishbel.Johnston Canyon is by-passed completely by this trail although there is a view into it from one point high above it on Trail 2. Despite its difficulty, the trail is well used. Skiers heading uphill should watch out for those coming down. Skiers on their way out should make the descent carefully and under control.",
