    "description": "The trail starts at the end of a logging road part way up HopeMountain.  From here you hike through blueberries, a steep forested area and then finally a bit of a rocky scramble on the back side of the mountain to the peak.  At the peak you will find a few tiny lakes along the way.  Great views of the town of Hope and into the Skagit Valley overlooking Silver Lake.",
    "directions": "Turn right off of HWY 3, across from the old Nicolum provincial campsite, onto the Hope Mountain FSR.  You will need a 4x4 to drive this road, there are lots of deep cross ditches.  Around 8 kms there is a sign at an intersection for the Hope Mountain Hike.  Keep right here, the road is quite bushy but this is the way in, and in about 1/2 a km you will reach a parking lot.  The trailhead is marked by lots of flagging tape just over the bank to the right side of the parking lot.  It is not the logging road that heads to the left, or towards Wells Peak.",
