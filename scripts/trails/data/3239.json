    "description": "From the parking lot in Cat Creek Recreation Area this easy family hiking trail starts at the north end of the turning loop. It soon crosses Hiway 40 (hold onto the kids hands) and gently climbs to a park bench from which affords a great view of the Highwood Valley and the peaks of the Great Divide. The trail wanders along over a low ridge the switchbacks down towards the creek. After crossing the old hiway by an old mine camp ( rest bench here too) you will cross the creek twice on two wooden bridges. Soon the trail ends in front of a beautiful little waterfall gushing through a gap into a high walled rock basin. Sit and enjoy your surroundings, it is very tranquil here. Combine this short walk and a picnic in one of Kananaskis Country's picturesque day use areas and come away relaxed and renewed.",
    "directions": "From Highwood Junction, the corner of Hiways 40, 940 and 541, go west on Hiway 40 ~6 km and turn south into Cat Creek Recreation Area. Remember this stretch of Hiway 40 is closed from Dec. 01 to Jun. 15 every year.",
