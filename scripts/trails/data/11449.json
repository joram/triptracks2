    "description": "This is an exploration more than a trail.  Setting off from the highway you wouldn't imagine a little pice of Eden about 800m from the road.  At first you are on an old logging road and once the road starts to go up the hill, cut across the old logged area and towards the brook which flows just east of the logging road.As you approach the brook you will see some remains of the majestic hemlock which used to cover the hill.  At the brook, walk upstream until the hills on both sides close up and the stream is more or less flowing into a wide ravine.  The ravine is well shaded due to the old hemlocks growing on it's sides.  The forest floor is covered by a thick layer of moss.  there area few smallish falls along the way but nothing major.  The valley itself is the destination rather than the falls.",
