    "description": "This is it, the whole enchilada.  An overview of the complete Baden-Powell trail, as it extends from Deep Cove to Horeshoe Bay. \nSections of it are commonly hiked for pleasure - including \"BP to Mosquitoe Creek\" and \"BP - St. Georges\", as well as the return portion of \"Brothers Creek\", and, further up on Cypress and Black Mountain.  All of which you will find on trailpeak.  However, very few people will attempt to do the complete Baden-Powell trail, except those foolish enough to enter the knee-knacker race, which is completed by the winner in the range of 6 hours.  \nWe're putting this out there because not many people have a sense for the complete trail however the GPS data is approximate and not for use in the field.  As of Aug 2010, we have also been emailed by a trailpeak user indicating that from Horshoe Bay up to Eagle Bluffs there are two major rock slide areas to traverse that are VERY dangerous.  User advises that this section should be avoided.\nUser comments below provide more detail.",
