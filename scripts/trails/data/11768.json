    "description": "We hiked 7 km up the road to 930 m. There road winds its way up the steep hills and twists through the valley, past multiple forks, eventually leading to the point were we entered the bush. Walter's route indicates that he followed the road to its terminus, ascended through a clear-cut and eventually traversed by the sub-peak before achieving the main summit. His return was more direct to the road. From the saddle between the two peaks, he hiked straight down the hill to the road.  If given the chance to hike through forest, rather than logging road, I will almost always chose the forest. We decided to go up the way Walter descended, up up and away!Read the full report on my blog:http://nolofacereinsipida.blogspot.ca/2015/02/MtButtle.html",
