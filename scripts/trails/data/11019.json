    "description": "This hike begins at the lighthouse opposite the Fortress.  Immediately you will notice the height of the headlands you will travel on as you gaze northwards.  Alternatively, you can begin the hike on the Big Loraine side.  Either way it's a great hike.  On a blustery day, the waves are crashing and spraying in multiple areas.  The trail is set on top of the bluffs and through the densely packed black spruce forest.   The barrens in the fall turn to bright colours.  There are a couple of beaches to traverse but none of them are very sandy yet....just wait a few thousand years for the cobbles to disintegrate.",
    "directions": "Louisbourg highway to Louisbourg.  follow signs to the lighthouse which is located north of the harbour.",
