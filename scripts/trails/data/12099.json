    "description": "Edwards Rating: I (I) M S ?Hike, not a scramble Elevation of 528 m NET, 720 m TOT & max 2439 m3 to 5 hoursThis is a long but easy and obvious hike with slow and steady elevation gain with a steeper slope on the last portion to the summit. Views are rewarding and I suggest you get there sooner in the day as it gets extremely busy. We were there just after sunrise and saw only one other group on the way up.The trail is obvious as you just go up the fire road and then you?ll have the possibility of going straight up to the summit or take long switchbacks for progressive elevation gain. We went straight on the way up and ran down the switchbacks. We also took a less popular trail on our right for the last 2 km approximately to get back to the parking lot. It was a nice and narrower trail and we avoided the crowd that way.",
    "directions": "From Calgary, follow Trans-Canada Highway/AB-1 W and take exit for AB-22 S to Bragg Creek. Just past Bragg Creek, turn right on AB-66 W for 13.9 km. Look for Moose Mountain Rd on your right and follow it for 7.2 km. The parking lot will be on your right.",
