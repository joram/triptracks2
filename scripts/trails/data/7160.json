    "description": "Trail Extends beyond Lake Moraine Trail following the river feeding into Lake Moraine. The trail provides an easy hike following along the river and climbs to a rock fall at 2.4 km providing a view back overlooking Moraine Lake.\r\rAt this point the trail disappears and becomes difficult as you scramble over the massive rock fall to see closer views of the glacial till at the foot of Mt. Tuzo and the Wenkchemna Glacier.",
    "directions": "Trail starts at the designated Lake Moraine Trail. Follow the trail to its end where the river flows in and then just continue past the end of the designated trail following the river.",
