    "description": "This is an easy hike to go see one of the few falls that lie right in the heart of HRM.  sometimes you donate have enough time to get out of the city to find a nice waterfall.  Well this is it...its only a few minutes from the city and its a pretty impressive fall when there is lots of water.  The only drawback is the wood mill next door.  Bu if you go in the summer you won't even see it for all the trees growing by the side of the river.  It,s an unofficial trail so there is minimal bushwhack at first and then some sort of established path to the falls.",
    "directions": "Saville Drive.  Turn on Lucasville Rd and park on the far side of the bridge over the Sackville River just passed the Heftier wood products.",
