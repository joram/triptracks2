    "description": "Grand WabushLabrador West: so many lakes, so many kayak opportunities. We've already done a few: De Mile lake, The Grande Hermine, Duley Lake.This year we chose the Grand Wabush Lake, just on the opposite side of the IOC tailing pond as the starting point. The Grand Wabush connects to the Julienne Lake, the Shabogamo Lake the Shabogamo Rriver; a 90 km ride opportunity at the exact same elevation up to the Marhshall fall near the Asuanipi River. This year we did exit at the Shabogamo Lake East Arm. See photos and GPS trail.",
    "directions": "On highway 500, about 10 km from Labrador City.",
