    "description": "The following information was copied from: Information Nanaimo:Ammonite Falls is named for the fossils that inhabit the stack of sedimentary layers of rock kept slick by the falls. A brief foray into the rock matrix in the Benson Creek Falls Regional Park reveals a vast number of concretions, ball'o'fossils that can be broken open to reveal ancient life. Most concretions contain merely a protean speck, while others house ammonites, snail-like creatures similar in shape and form to the modern Nautilus. These were very common in Paleozoic and Mesozoic oceans, 400 to 65 million years ago. Many large shells are embedded in the stone of the riverbed (one at least is the area of a Nanaimo bus schedule).",
    "directions": "Drive - From Jingle Pot Road, turn onto Kilpatrick Road. Take the first right onto Jameson Road. Follow Jameson to the end. There is a paved sideroad to the right called Creekside which goes into a new development. Continue straight on Jameson onto the gravel. Please be aware that NO PARKING ALLOWED on Jameson Rd!Jameson Rd is a popular access to Ammonite Falls and Benson Creek Falls Regional Park. Increased parking volumes along Jameson Rd and Creekside Place have caused traffic congestion and unsafe access to driveways. In the fall 2014 the Creekside Place Community Park parking lot was expanded and upgraded to fit 24 vehicles. Visitors are requested to drive 200m metres down the hill to the parking lot and then walk in.",
