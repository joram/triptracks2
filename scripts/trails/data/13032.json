    "description": "I was following an indication on an old map that pointed this general area as having a cascade and gorge!   I followed the main Brierly brook and entirely missed the tributary at first.  I back tracked and found it!  The ravine for the tributary is quite steep and full of deadfall at first.  But if you persevere you will see the mini gorge.  in there there are a few nice cascade on some really mossy rocks.  The hike could be done via the paved road next to the brook to circumvent the deadfall.",
