    "description": "NTS Map: 083C08This trail is a really short walk to hit if you have to wait for the hostel desk person to return.  It's about 25 minutes long, crosses 2 small log bridges, and takes you to a pretty big beaver dam.  It was my test trail for my first gps use ever.",
    "directions": "Park off highway 11 at the Shunda Creek Hostel.  The hostel road is 1 km south of the Nordegg turn off.  Just before the parking lot is a field, and the trail begins on the left side of the field.",
