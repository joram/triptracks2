    "description": "This is a good trail up to the Sierra de la Laguna (Baja Mexico) with some magnificent views of the peninsula from high up. Scenic mountains peaking at 7,096 ft (2,163 m) at Picacho La Laguna Peakfeet, (24\u00b000'N 109\u00b045'W), and covered with lush pine and oak forests. A GPS track file is attached (click on download GPS above), download it into your GPS using G7TOWIN, or OZI-explorer, and then find and follow the trail using your GPS.  The actual text file in OZI-explorer (you can cut and paste it) submitted by the author is provided below, if you prefer. \r\nMany people know about the popular Cabos San Lucas as the Southern Tropical tip of Baja, for its nearby surfing and empty beaches, and as a sailing port of call.   Perhaps you could make a base in 'Cabos' and take day trips or overnighters to hike, kayak, or surf!\r\n\r\nPhoto courtesy of Jim Rosinski.\r",
    "directions": "On the road, la Paz, Cabo San Lucas by way of Todo Santos passing Todosantos 4 or 5 km (Todos Santos  is an ?Artists Colony? just one hour north of Cabo San Lucas on the Pacific side). On the left take a dirt road to La Burrera, drive up to the gate, park and start hiking. You may wish to use your GPS to see that it matches the first few waypoints.\r",
