    "description": "A great trail up on Burke mtn. One of the highest trails up there. After the power lines make sure that you do the abyss it is awesome. Its got a bunch of drops, launches, logrides and ladders. If you go on the old triple crown to the red R it is old school. After you finish up you cross a ditch on a ladder and if you go up a couple hundred meters you will reach the \"flying divit\". It will take you to \"Galloway\". Or turn right and go back to the gate if you drove to there.",
    "directions": "Go up coast Meridian in Port Coquitlam and turn right on the gravel road (Harper) go up Harper untill you get to the gate. Go up this road and take the 2nd major left. Go up here past the power lines to a big clearing, there you can either go down to the left to \"vics\", take the middle trail to \"sawblade\" (don't try find it if you have never been there before) or take the main road up to triple crown. GO up this road and follow it up a winding hill untill it makes a sharp turn to the left. The trailhead is right in front of you. It starts out flat and then turns right and goes down the mountain.",
