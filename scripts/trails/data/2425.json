    "description": "NTS Map: 082O03The first part of this trail is an easy 2km walk along Heart Creek past popular climbing walls. At the trails end there is a bench for relaxing below a waterfall that can't really be seen due to the angle. For a view of the falls and a great place for a soak cross over the creek and start climbing the hill. The obvious path along the rock face is difficult but about ten meters to the left (downstream) there is a more gradual path leading up. When you reach the top of the hill continue down the other side until you reach a small backcountry campsite. Again, there is an easy way straight ahead and a hard way to the right. Directly behind the camp is a tiny waterfall and a great soaking pool on a hot day. From here if you continue downstream about ten minutes you will reach the top of the waterfall. Every time I've gone there I have had it all to myself. Please pack out your garbage and any you may find along the way. Enjoy.",
