    "description": "This is again an easy walk to some locally known falls.   As there are many version of this river's name throughout the province, this East River is located in HRM near Tantallon.The river is parallel to the old school Rd and there is a ewell worn path next to it.  I wouldn't make a detour for this fall but it's a a nice stop on the way to the Peggy's Cove barrens",
    "directions": "Peggys cove Rd (highway 213).  Turn on the old school rd and park by the river near where it flows under the Peggys cove Rd.",
