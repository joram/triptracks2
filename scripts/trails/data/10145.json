    "description": "The Trail of the Coeur d'Alenes is fantastic. As it is an old railbed, the climbing is minimal. However, you more then get a workout by cruising thetrail at a high rate of speed. The pavement is about as smooth as it comes\n... all 70+ miles of it.\nThe attached GPS data is only 25 miles (42km) from Cataldo - Harrison.",
