    "description": "The winter route to The Spout is much shorter than the summer East Coast Trail path.  It passes over wetlands than cannot be travelled unless they are completely frozen.  Parts of the trail can be done on foot and parts by snow shoe.  Cross country skies can be used for parts only and may hit a lot of rocks.",
    "directions": "Travel south from St. John's on highway 3 (Robert Howlett Memorial Drive) until it meets highway 10 (Main Street) in The Goulds.  From there, travel south 5.4km.  There are no signs for the trail head.  It appears as an ATV track through the woods.  There is no parking area.  One must park on the side of the highway.",
