    "description": "NTS Map: 092G07\nNOTE: this trail entry is deprecated, a more recent and much better map exists here.\nCOQUITLAM TRAILS MAP.\nEagle Ridge has a great trail network that gives the advanced rider a lot to work with.  It's lower trails are great to play on and buld skills, although not that easy. (UPDATE: EWOK city is no more, these were the lower trails with lots of ramps and ladders, a housing development is in). We've provided a few trails here, from Four Lost Souls, to Fat bastard, and, some unknown trail that we used to get back to the parking lot before dark.  Figure you should make friends with the locals to take you up where the newer trails are. A good meeting spot is the starbucks nearby in Port Moody, take the trans-Canada East from Vancouver, exit into Port Moody (exit ramp, then left), and follow into a mall area -- look for other riders at Starbucks, wish we had better instructions for you, I know we parked at a nearby school, comments welcome in the discussion forum.",
