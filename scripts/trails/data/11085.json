    "description": "The trail starts very steeply as it climbs up out of the Saskatchewan River valley.  At the top of the ridge their is junction, left will take you to Sunset Lookout, which provides an excellent view of the Saskatchewan River valley.  Take the branch to the right to continue on to Sunset Pass and Pinto Lake.  At approximately 4 km you will arrive at the Norman Campground (Parks Canada No 5).  As you cross the meadow watch for bears feeding on the berries that cover the entire floor of the valley.  The 5 km hike will slowly lift you up to the top of Sunset Pass where you can view Pinto Lake and start your decent to the Lake.  The trail to Pinto Lake circles the west side of the lake, terminating on the north side of the lake at the point where the Cline river exits the Lake.  A primitive, but pleasant campground welcomes you.",
    "directions": "The trail head is 16.5 km north of Saskatchewan Crossing on Highway 93 or 28.5 km south of the Banff-Jasper boundary at Sunwapta Pass.  There is a small parking area just off of the highway just west of where Highway 93 crosses Norman Creek.",
