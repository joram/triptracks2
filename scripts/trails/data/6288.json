    "description": "The first half of this trail, through an old growth forest is easy to follow. As the trail leaves the forest, the views open up as it enters a meadow and heads west. At the edge of the meadow, near Olivia Creek, there is a primitive campsite. Red triangles on the far side of the meadow mark where the well defined trail resumes. The rest of the trail is a very exposed. Hikers should be prepared for sudden weather changes, as shelter is very limited. From the meadow, the trail begins to climb steeply. Take care, as this steep section is slippery when wet. Until the Sulphur Creek basin is reached, the trail continues to be challenging and care must be taken, as falling rock, steep cliffs below the trail and a rocky face must be crossed. After this rugged section, the trail enters the meadow at the top of Sulphur Creek, where another primitive campsite can be found. In this area, the trail passes near an area of Karst topography with sink-holes, caves and huge limestone boulders that tumbled off the shoulder of the Three Sisters. From Sulphur Creek, it is an easy hike up a good trail to the ridge. Once on the ridge, there are fine views down into Fairy Creek and Fernie; across to Mt. Fernie; back to Mount Bisaro and Mount Klauer and up the west ridge of the Three Sisters. Lucky hikers may see mountain goats. Less lucky ones may encounter grizzly or black bears.",
    "directions": "Commencing at the bridge over the Elk River, on the north end of Fernie, proceed east along Hwy 3 for 5.2 km to Dicken Road. Turn left onto Dicken Road and proceed for 600 m. Turn right onto the Hartley Lake Road. Set your odometer to ?0?. Follow this rough, 2 wheel drive gravel road for 9 km, passing by Hartley Lake. At odometer 9 km, turn left onto a rough, 4 wheel drive track. Follow this track.",
