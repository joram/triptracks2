    "description": "This hike is at the Long Lake Provincial Park. There are trails every where?s cross crossing. There are many paths down to the water. You can also walk along the coast line; there are lots of rocks though so watch your ankles. The main trails are well maintained not too many downed trees in the way. Lots of great resting spots to catch some rays and have some lunch. I hope you enjoy this trail as much as my dogs and I did. \rHappy Hiking and always take out what you take in.\r",
    "directions": "There are two places you can park one big parking lot and a small one. They are pretty much side by side. The GPS cordinates are 44 37.939N 63 39.466W for the small parking lot. It's right on St. Margaret's Bay rd. before the exhibition park turn off.",
