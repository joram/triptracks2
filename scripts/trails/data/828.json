    "description": "NTS Map:92F1.  This is a nice walk on 5 kms of trail (about an 1 hour) that will take you out to a point with nice views.  The trails are well maintained.  Once you get past the lumberyard, it is amazing how quiet and forest-like it is.  Nice views of Nanaimo from here and the shore scenery is really neat.",
    "directions": "Take the Island Parkway to Nanaimo and get off at Highway 19 to Duke Point.  Then get off at Jackson Road and park at the parking lot.",
