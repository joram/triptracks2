    "description": "I was in the area of Fielding Road, overnighting at the awesome new chalets called Vally View and add about 2 hours before sunset. I decided to hike up Bens Brook next door. It has carved a deep valley but unfortunately no real fall. I popped out of the valley at the top of the mountain and onto Fielding Road. Luckily I had loaded my GPS with some waypoints on Nile brook running right next to the road. I had enough daylight and here is what I found...\nI used an\u00a0ATV track which went towards Nile Brook. After a few minutes, the ATV trail went right and I went left and descended a fairly steep slope all the way to Nile Brook...about 200m in total descent. Upon reaching Nile Brook, there were a few cascade types of falls of about 6-10 ft in height....walking downstream, another 300m I soon reached a small gorge like feature with a main two tier fall of about 20ft or so. If you look at sat imagery the fall cannot be seen but a long slide in the mountain next door can be readily seen. To get back to fielding road, I just climbed the hill next to the fall and followed a contour line back to the ATV trail. If you hurry like me because the sun is setting, it will take about 50 min in total.\u00a0 BTW I call it lower Nile Brook has I have already explored some fall in the upper part of the Brook",
