    "description": "The trail is located on the West Side of Whistler and is a combination of a short (20 min) uphill followed by a 25 minute technical single track descent",
    "directions": "Best way to access the trail is through the Stonebridge estates off of West Side Road. Head to the near top of the road elevation is 830 Meters. Duck off onto the private property driveway and you'll be right under the power line. Follow the trail up a very short dirt hill and then you're on the single track. At 50 07 18N 122 59 17W you'll intercept \"Whip Me Snip Me\" go across that trail and you're back on the single track.\nThe trail end on West Side Road (AKA Alta Lake Road) at 50 07 24N 122 59 09W. From there you've got lots of options: River Runs Through It, Emerald Forest, Bob's Rebob....\nAvoid this when it's wet - makes for some slippery side hill roots!",
