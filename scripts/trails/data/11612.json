    "description": "Begins as an uneventful stroll along a busy horse trail. Once you get off the main trail there is some fairly steep, unmaintained trail up to the top of the ridge. Lost the trail for a bit, had to bushwhack to the  ridge. Worth the effort for incredible views of the Rockies from the abandoned Rock Lake Lookout.",
    "directions": "Trail departs from Rock Lake Staging area along Mountain Trail. Follow Mountain Trail approximately 4.5 km from staging area until you reach Wildhay River Crossing. Don't cross Wildhay River, look for campsite near crossing and the Willmore Overlook Trail running up from it.",
