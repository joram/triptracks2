    "description": "The Prince Albert Ski Club (PASC) maintains a trail network at Little Red River Park, located on Highway #55, just minutes east of the Diefenbaker Bridge that crosses the North Saskatchewan River.\r\rPASC grooms and tracks over 35 km of classic and freestyle ski trails with the bulk of the trails designed for classic skiing. Our trails range from novice to expert in difficulty and run through predominantly jack pine and spruce forest. You can choose to ski our shortest trail, the Sports Council Loop (novice), at 1.3 km, or plan a route that contains several loops, such as the River-West-Tower-Kristi loop ( ~ 15 km, intermediate-expert) or the River-East Poplar (~ 10 km, novice-intermediate) loop. Both the River Trail (5 km) and Sports Council Loop are lit for night skiing.\r\rThe Cosmopolitan (Cosmo) Lodge, located in the core area of the Little Red River Park, is open seven days a week and provides skiers with a concession, washrooms, and warm-up area. PASC information, including trail maps, trail conditions, and membership information is available at the Lodge.",
