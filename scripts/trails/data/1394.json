    "description": "Elevation Gain: 678 m (2,225 ft).\r\n\r\nThis pleasant trail-hike in Glacier National Park (Montana) has many interesting viewpoints along the way, including 3 glacier fed ponds, cliffside waterfalls and a spectacular trail that clings to the mountainside. No scrambling is required, and the trail is quite moderate throughout.\r\n\r\nAt the top of the Pass you have a few choices: turn around, descend to the other side of the pass to \u00c2?the loop' via the chalet on the  Highline Trail\r\n, or continue upwards to the fire lookout which is about another hour's grunt uphill (see  Swiftcurrent Mountain\r\n). My group chose to climb to the top of the ridge to the south of the Pass, which gave us a closeup of Swiftcurrent glacier. In the distance we could also see Jackson Glacier. From the top of the pass it took us about 20 minutes to get up to the top of this ridge. On the return trip, we saw a moose with a gigantic set of antlers near Many Glacier.\r\n\r\nAnother way that others have done this hike is to start at \u00c2?the loop' and hike via the Granite Chalet and do a car-shuttle by parking a second vehicle at Many Glacier. That way one does less uphill and you still get to enjoy the rollercoaster ride down to Many Glacier. \r\n\r\nNote: If your aim is to get to the firelookout, you're better off starting at 'the loop', as it is a full day's hike just to get to the pass from Many Glacier.\r",
