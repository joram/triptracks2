    "description": "NTS Map: 082N08Lake O'Hara circuit is a 2.8 km loop that hugs the lake. You'll cross several foot bridges and a waterfall. Lake Oesa is a 6.4 return climb from Lake O'Hara. Lake O'Hara is a beautiful lake that you must view for yourself. The trail up to Lake Oesa is a work of art by Lawrence Grassi. Stepping stones galore, and scenery to die for. You'll pass several lakes and a rock slide before reaching Lake Oesa. Once at Lake Oesa, you have the option of returning the same way or taking the Yukness Ledge Alpine Route back to Lake O'Hara. The trailhead for Lake Oesa starts 0.8 km into the left side of the Lake O'Hara trail.  \r\n\r\nIn winter please check the Avaluator\r\n(Online Trip Planner) rating is: \r\n Simple.  \r\nSee more trip planner route details here.\r",
