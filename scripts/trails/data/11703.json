    "description": "A nice hike along the shore of the Bay of Fundy for about 1.5km will bring you to an unassuming brook which has 3 major falls and countless smaller falls and sliders.   The hike along the seashore is a bit difficult at first and its easier to follow an old tav trail.  After a while the seashore becomes this mass of rocks which is super easy to walk on and you can walk along the shore quite easily even at mid tide.  Once at the brook, there is a three footer and then immediately another fall of about 17ft which I call Kettle Fall because it has a huge boulder in the middle section creating a kettle or a cauldron over time.  The best fall is just a bit further and is a cascading type.   Onward you will see a bunch more of the 5-10ft height until you hit the dirt road at the top portion about 1.5km away from the seashore.  Then it?s easy to get back to the car just follow the dirt road until you come back to your car.",
