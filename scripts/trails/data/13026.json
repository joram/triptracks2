    "description": "There is no real trail, but it is great early season  hike into semi alpine terrain. Views are great. Cramp Ons are needed, if you attempt any earlier than July 7th take snowshoes. Ones you get up the ridge which can be icy and if earlier than July its pretty casual Stroll.",
    "directions": "From Sicamous BC  drive up the OwlHead FSR. WPT  50.837933\u00b0 -118.956693\u00b0 . It is about 25.7 km on high clearance SUV 4x4 better. The road up top is pretty good even better than the drive up the first 15 km.",
