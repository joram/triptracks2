    "description": "Great shortish (10k) loop that can be combined with many others in the area to make a day or weekend out of it.  Has a number of semi-technical areas and a few features, but safe enough for anyone.\r\rYou can do this at any pace you want, it is a great flowing, fun buncha singletrack.  Strongly recommended.",
    "directions": "Head a little South of town, turn right (West) on Mt. Fernie Provincial Park Road.  Park just outside the park gates (where it is free).  Ride through the park about 1km exactly, look for Gorby on left.  Ride up to the top of Gorby and down to the lef to find Haulback, MegaHurtz, Old Goat",
