    "description": "Abbey Pond Trail is located East from Middlebury, VT.   Trail goes along with river strem and/or cascades.  After hiking 2.3 miles, you'll reach to Abbey Pond. The first 0.2-0.3 miles, you climb moderately until you reach to the first bridge, but eventually trail ascends steadily. From 1.5-1.6 miles area, hiking becomes easier because terrain in gentler. however, in Spring time(April-May), the trail around here until you reach Abbey Pond is very muddy.  You'll see beatutiful view at Abbey Pond as the final destination.",
    "directions": "From North (Burlington area), take Rt 116 toward South.  After passing Bristol, you'll see the sign of \"Abbey Pond Trail\" sign at the left side.  Take turn left and proceed on gravel road until you reach to the Parking Lot.  Abbey Pond Trailhead starts from this Parking Lot.",
