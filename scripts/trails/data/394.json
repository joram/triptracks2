    "description": "NOTE:  As of June 2008, Myra Canyon is fully open for business.  There may be a little bit of finishing touches so a call might be in order, but you should be good to go!The old Kettle Valley Railway bed in Myra Canyon is a great ride for cyclists of all abilities. Remnant trestles and tunnels make the route especially appealing.  Marvel at turn-of-the-century construction feats used to surmount the many drainages that ring the valley headwall. Myra Canyon can be cycled as a loop via June Springs Road/ Little White FSR or as an out-and-back from Myra Station to Ruth Station.If you chose the less strenuous option, and drive up to Myra Station, you won't have to contend with the 500 vertical metre grind to the rail bed. In summer, this can be a hot, dusty grunt. Saving the loop until fall may be the ticket. Whatever you decide, standing on the high trestles at 1000 metres provides a welcome and cool sub-alpine breeze as it funnels down the canyon displacing hot air in the valley below.The riding is straight forward and enjoyable. Thanks to various local rotary clubs and donations from small businesses, the trestle ties have been boarded ensuring smooth safe travel. The bridges all have railings making it virtually impossible for a cyclist to catapult into the abyss. The railway bed is smooth and sandy with only a few washouts and rocks to detour around.  This high route is scenic, historic and recommended. Snow usually persists till mid-April so plan your adventure accordingly.Other Details:Distance 12km out and backElevation Gain\t\t150mTerrain\t- Double track   100%High Point\t\t1050mMap -82 E/14 & E/11",
