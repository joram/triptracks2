    "description": "The trail is mostly on an old logging road, with a number of possible scrambles up or down between switchbacks. About a kilometre in or so the Okanagan Valley starts to appear through the trees, the view getting better and better as you get higher. At the top you get a un obstructed view of Osoyoos and many beautiful orchards  There is GPS data attached to this trail (see \"download GPS\"), which if loaded into your GPS can help you find route points.\r\n\r",
    "directions": "To get to the base of this trail, drive west from Osoyoos on Hyw 3 following it to the top of the hill.  On the right you will pass a gravel pit, and just past this turn right up the back road.  You can follow this for quite some time if you have 4X4 but the further you drive, the shorter you stroll. A good place to park is about 1.5 km in, where there is a sign with a map of the area. It is 22 km from the highway to the summit, and depending on how far you drive in will determine how long it takes to complete the trail.\r",
