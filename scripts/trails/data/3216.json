    "description": "The first 4km. of this trail is on an old logging road and a little mundane. Ok, ok sure the mountains, as usual, are grand. At the \"T\" go left down hill towards Watridge Lake. The lake, looking at some of the catches, is a pretty fair cutthroat pond if not a much of a lake to look at. From the lake follow trail towards the spring in the direction of the roar.From Watridge to Karst Spring, about 1 km., is the best part of the trip. As the roar increases you come upon this raging creek; deadfall laying on moss covered islets and the volume of water is staggering. Soon you reach the source of the spring with a nice viewing platform and discription of a karst spring. Elevation gain/loss is slight so take the kids and camera. This trail is 9km., round trip, and well signed.",
    "directions": "From Canmore take Spray Trail south to Mt. Engadine Lodge road and follow, keeping right at all intersections, to Mt. Shark parking lot. Trailhead is behind information board near parking lot entrance.",
