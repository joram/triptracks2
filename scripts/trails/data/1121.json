    "description": "Snakes and Ladders is one of the older trails at the Woodlot.  In the past year a couple of builders have been revamping it.  They've redone all the bridges, added a nice gap jump about halfway down and a huge new log ride roller coaster section.  I'm told there is a ton more to come.  Two steep rock faces and a sketchy rooldown make this trail a must see.  Good times.",
    "directions": "Head to Maple Ridge and stop at either High Gear Bike or Maple Ridge Cycle and ask directions.  Once at the Woodlot, hook up with a local.  \nMore Mission Woodlot trails can be found here \n\nThe Woodlot - Maple Ridge, B.C., Canada \nSnakes and Ladders Helmet Cam\nmore mountain biking videos can be found here",
