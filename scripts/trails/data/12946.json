    "description": "A nice hike of less than 3 hours leads to some spectacular views. Care is required anywhere near the edge as the rock is slippery in both wet and dry conditions. This steep sided hunk of limestone rises above the countryside between Parksville and Errington. While the twisting road to the top is well known as an easy way to access spectacular views, comparatively few people are aware of the enjoyable walking trails braiding through second and third growth forests under its spectacular cliff faces.",
    "directions": "Take exit 51 off  highway 19. Go towards Coombs on Hwy 4, turn left  on Bellevue, take the first road on the left  which is Allsbrook Rd.  Drive for approximately 2.5 kms and watch for a yellow gate on the right.",
