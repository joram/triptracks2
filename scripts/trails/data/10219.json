    "description": "Big Hill Springs is located between parkland and foothills natural regions; the main attraction is a series of small waterfalls that flow year-round over rocky terraces covered with a lush growth of shrubs and grasses; the park is also the site of an historic fish hatchery and Alberta's first commercial creamery.The Tufa deposits make some rather interesting formations. It's an easy walk.",
    "directions": "The access road to Big Hill Springs Park is located 25 km west of Airdrie on Highway 567. Alternatively, from Calgary, take highway 766 north, and turn west on Highway 567. Watch for the sign pointing to Big Hill Springs Provincial Park. From there its 2 km south to the trail head.",
