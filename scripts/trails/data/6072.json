    "description": "A lovely, easy hike in North Vancouver, BC, approx 15 kms return, 460 total ascent. The trail follows Lynn creek, with at least 3 crossings avaialble, including the famous Lynn Canyon Suspension Bridge.\r\rWe started at Inter River Park, just north and west of Capilano University off Lillooet Road in North Van, went north along the Creek, crossed over at Twin Falls bridge, stopped at Lynn Canyon Park for coffee, then continued north on the west side of the creek (ie, we did NOT cross the Lynn Canyon Suspension Bridge, although you should venture onto it for the thrill), eventually along Varley Trail all the way to Lynn Headwaters Park. \r\rAt that point, we crossed the creek, and headed back south on the east side of the creek, back to the Lynn Canyon Suspension Bridge, and eventually back to the Inter River Park TH.\r\rThe trail goes along parts of the Baden Powell Trail and the Varley Trail.",
    "directions": "If coming on Hwy 1 (West), take Exit 22B after the Ironworkers Memorial Bridge. After the exit, move immediately into the centre lanes and continue straight (north) onto Lillooet Road. Go past the lights at Purcell (leads to Capilano University). Left onto Inter River Park Road (you'll see a horse stable). Turn right and drive to the very end of the parking lot.",
