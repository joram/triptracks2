    "description": "This is a waterfall that captured my attention a while ago.  I was looking at some old 1890's maps and they showed a \"fine fall\" on the lower reaches of this brook.  I explored the start of that narrow valley and went up about 1.5km but there was no falls to be found.   Fast forward to October 2015 and to the discovery of an unofficial path to the fall.  The trail is marked with orange, blue and pink tape.  It traverses a mostly maple beech mature forest that is covered by ferns on the ground.  The trail goes down slowly for the first part but then becomes very steep at the end.  Someone has put some ropes but be careful using those.  Once you reach the stream, the fall is just a bit upstream.",
    "directions": "On the Middle river West Rd, turn on Gairloch mountain and go uphill to some flagging tape on the left side of the road at approx N46 07.696 W60 58.636",
