    "description": "This is a hike that leads you to a few small waterfalls at first and then a massive one at the end.  I guarantee that you will get wet on this hike.  The path is to follow the river upstream.  At first you can enter the forest and follow it.  Then the stream narrows with rock walls on either side.  If the water is low you can still stay on one side or the other and stay dry.  The first fall is easily passable on its right hand side (facing upstream).  The rock wall surrounding it are very tall on one side.After that first wall, the ravine narrows even further and in some cases you have to use stemming or your rock climbing skills to keep dry.  However most of the water is probably only waist deep ....so there is another option!The final fall reveals itself and its a beauty.  There is the lower fall of about 15ft ....if you make it up that one then the larger one is just ahead and plunges into a deep pool.   This is overall an excellent adventure only a few minutes from Cheticamp but once you are in the ravine you feel completely remote.  BTW the next brook over (Aucoin Bk) also has a fall and it is less hard to get to that one",
    "directions": "Take The Cheticamp Back Rd and turn on Plantin Rd and follow it until it comes right by Fiset Brook.  Leave your car and walk upstream.",
