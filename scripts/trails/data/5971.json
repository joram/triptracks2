    "description": "An easy walk around Kekuli Bay provincial park.  The park is not too big, and the trail is entirely viable from the campground, which dominates the park.  There are some cool wildflowers, birds and large rodent type animals that all flourish within the park.   A good short walk in the summer.  Bring sunscreen!!",
    "directions": "The trail starts by the entrance to the campground in Kekuli Bay Provincial park, just south of Vernon.  During the winter, the trail may still exist, but access to the park does not.  You can park at the gate at the top of the park road and pick up the trail from there if you wish, or walk to the bottom and start at the usual trail head.",
