    "description": "A great recreational canoe route. canoe through a seriese of lakes connected by short portages and quiet rivers loaded with fish.  This trip can easily just be a day trip if you turn around at any of the rapids/portages you will encounter on your way to Elbow lake, or you can continue through Elbow to McGregor and into Snowshoe lake.  The trail is getting more and more popular, so signage and camp spots are increased, as well as more regular portage maintenance.",
    "directions": "Put in and take out at Tulabi lake in Nopiming park. The route is obvious and easy to follow.\r\n\r\nTo get to the trail head from Winnipeg, take highway 59 north to highway 44, then go east to 11, north to provincial road 313 and finally follow provincial road 315 and turn off left when you see the Tulabi campground sign.  There is a parking lot to leave you vehicle.",
