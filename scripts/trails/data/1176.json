    "description": "NTS Map: 92G6. A good workout for experienced confident day hikers alike.\r\nFollow \"Headwaters Trail\" to \"Coliseum Mountain Route\" (maps provided at the gate) about 5.5 km of fairly level well marked trail. Once you reach the \"Coliseum Mountain Route\" marker, which is just before Norvan Falls, it begins as a fairly steep ascent up the mountain. The route is pretty well marked (square yellow reflectors), although it gets more sporadic as you climb higher up, so be wary of where you are going.\r\nAfter climbing for about 1.5km you will start to see Norvan Creek to your left and will follow along side it for a little bit which can be quite muddy in parts so appropriate caution should be taken. Once past the creekside you now level off somewhat as you ascend for about 1km . For the last 2-2.5 km you go through a series of tight narrow passages, so be mindful of the trail and markers because there are some steep dropoffs if you venture too far from the marked path. Once you reach the peak there are clear views of Vancouver to the south, Crown Mtn. is to your west, Cathedral Mtn. is to your north and the famous \"Lions\" are to your west although they look somewhat unfamiliar from this angle.\r\nAltogether a very invigorating hike - proper footwear is highly recommended  as it is quite a long journey. Lots of fluids are \r\nnecessary to keep you hydrated as well.\r\n\r\nGPS Waypoints Reference:\r\n\r\nWPT001 Parking lot/Entrance\r\n\r\nWPT002 Coliseum Mountain Route\r\n\r\nWPT003 Cute Waterfall\r\n\r\nWPT004 Peak of Coliseum Mountain\r",
