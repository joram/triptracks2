    "description": "The network has a bunch of trails to different cabins and one 20km trail to Lac Philippe. There is equally as much downhill as uphill with long stretches of climbing and the same for descending. The trails have some fire road but do have some rocky and rooty technical areas. The trails don't really have names; however there are signs indicating where the trail will take you and how long the trail is. From the parking lot simply head up to the trail and turn around when you're done.",
    "directions": "From the MacDonald-Cartier bridge, take Hwy 5 north to Old Chelsea Rd. (exit 12) and follow into Gatineau Park. Park in the lot signed for O'Brien. You have to pay to park so ride your bike in to avoid the fee.",
