    "description": "This is one of those falls I visited quite a while ago but forgot to post via trailpeak. The north side of the Cobequid Hills have a different geology than the south side and because of that, falls aren't very plentiful on this side. Lawrence Brook does have some for those willing to travel a fairly long dirt road to them.",
    "directions": "Highway 2 to Southampton. Turn on Cannan Rd, cross the bridge and turn left on a dirt road at; 45.58474, -64.24858. Continue on it to a bridge over Lawrence Brook at; 45.53663, -64.20572. The falls are upstream approximately at; N45\u00b0 31' 35.5\" W64\u00b0 12' 27.8\".\u00a0 There are falls on both branches of this brook.",
