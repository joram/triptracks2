    "description": "East Sooke park from Aylard Farm Parking to Cabin Point via Coast Trail outbound and Interior Trail inbound. It's 2 hours plus going out but only 1 hour plus returning on the Interior Trail. \nIts most redeeming feature is the climb along the Coast Trail and the Trap Shack at trail's end.",
    "directions": "From Victoria, BC, follow Sooke Highway to Metchosin Rd. to Happy Valley Rd. to Rocky Point rd. to Becher Bay Rd. to Aylard Farm parking lot.",
