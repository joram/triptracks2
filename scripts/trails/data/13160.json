    "description": "An out and back hike up a canyon that starts out on an outwash plain and climbs through a narrow canyon. The trails ends with a moderate climb up and out of the canyon on to a ridge that overlooks the incredible Artist's Drive area.The trail is rated as moderate due to a couple of short dry falls you will have to climb over, as well as the last short steep climb out of the canyon. There are also a couple of very short side canyons that are fun to investigate but they don't connect to anywhere.There is another canyon located adjacent to the parking area so be careful to set out on the eastward trail around a low hump of rocks that soon drops into a wash, and not on the south leading trail.",
    "directions": "An unmarked gravel road located 6km south of CA-190 on Badwater Road.",
