    "description": "I was in Waverley and decided to check out the old gold mine workings located east of Powder Mill Lake.  The walk there was a bushwack but once I was on site there were numerous small foot paths and some atv trails which means I didn't go at it from the right direction!But that's ok, I walked in quite easily and went up some small hills.  found some old working well away from the main ones and some large boulders too.   At the main workings there were a lot of the danger signs up stating there were open holes.  At the present time, all have been infilled.  There were some signs that people have been digging in the old piles of stones maybe for some gold?  It's hard to imagine what this area would have looked like a 100 years ago.  The forest has reclaimed most of this area.",
