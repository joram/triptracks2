    "description": "Nice trail up to Heart Lake. The stone stairs section is a bit steep so go up this way as much harder coming down. Nice little waterfalls on the way down along the old logging road. Great view from the top just before Heart Lake, great place for a rest and a snack. Overall a nice hike, just over 2 hrs round trip if you go at a brisk pace.",
    "directions": "Drive to Ladysmith - entrances off Dogwood Dr., Sixth Ave., and Mackie Rd.",
