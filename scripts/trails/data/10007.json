    "description": "Laurier Woods Trails offers a surprisingly natural series of recreational trails given its proximity to the city.  The property is a mixture of upland bush and wetland cells.  The trails are well maintained with wooden bridges crossing the marshes.  \nThe trail itself is well marked, colour coded, and trail maps are mounted on signs throughout the trail.",
    "directions": "The trailhead is at the end of Brule St. in North Bay.  \nUTM Coordinates:    619841 mE     5129369 mN",
