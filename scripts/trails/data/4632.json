    "description": "Cartwright mountain is within Summerland and as such is acquiring development all the time. It also was the source for the irrigation flume in a bygone era. As such there exists a trail along some of the original flume right of way. There are also other trails around the mountain.From the top and along flume portion there are some great views of the Giants Head and Okanagan valley. In season flowers including cactus flowers abound. (May ).It gets hot up here in the summer season so be prepared, it's also rattlesnake country.Bike shop / rentals: Freedom Bike Shop Accomodations: Summerland Resort",
    "directions": "This is the difficult part, the trail head as found this time was in a state of destruction. Follow Jubilee Rd west to Cartwright turn right (north) on Cartwright to the sort of end. I'm not sure how the development will occur. The trail is up the hill on your left. There should be access through the development at where Cartwright proceeds up a steep hill on left.",
