    "description": "This is a nice little hike to a seldom seen fall near Parrsboro.  This fall is perfect to visit and possibly cool off whenever you are already hiking to Wasson's bluff or the Clark's Head Natural Arch.  There isn't much of a trail as you follow the stream from the road right to the coastline where the fall is located.  However on the western side of the brook I was lucky enough to discover (on my way back from the fall), an old woods road which makes it more easy to travel then through the thick alder batches near the stream.  I wished I had discovered it on the way to the fall instead!  The fall drops from a plateau for about 20 ft to the seafloor.",
    "directions": "Two islands Road from Parrsboro, the brook to follow crosses the road right after the Old Farm road turn off.",
