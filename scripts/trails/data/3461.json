    "description": "An easy and wide trail along the east shore of Lake Okanagan in Knox Mountain Park, in Kelowna. The trail begins at the 1st pavilion (road closed in winter though, so walk up) and heads along the shore. At the end is a beach and picnic area.  There is a submerged statue at the beach for divers to check out. Easy and fun walk.  The houses disappear about half way, and there are plenty of spots to stop and sit along the trail.",
    "directions": "Enter Knox Mountain Park and either \na) park at the bottom and walk to the 1st pavilion.  The trail begins there.\nb)drive up to the 1st pavilion, park, and begin your hike.",
