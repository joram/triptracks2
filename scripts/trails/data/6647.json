    "description": "Possibly one of the most beautiful snowshoe trips you will ever make, from Chateau Lake Louise to Plain of Six Glaciers Lookout, in fact overseeing Victoria Glacier, above Lake Louise.\nOn Feb 24, 2010, Lake Louise was frozen solid, so we were able to walk on the lake itself to the southwest end, before catching the trail to the Plain of Six Glaciers Teahouse (not open in the winter) and the glacier lookout.\nBEWARE: NEVER VENTURE OUT ON A LAKE, INCLUDING THIS ONE, UNLESS YOU ARE CERTAIN THE ICE IS THICK AND HARD ENOUGH TO CARRY YOUR WEIGHT.\nBecause of a late start, we didn't quite make it to the end (have been there in the summer). but enjoyed great weather and views (see photos).",
    "directions": "Off the TransCanada Hway at the Lake Louise exit, drive right up to the Lake Louise public parking lot. Don't forget to obtain your day pass as you drive into Banff National Park. At the lakehead, if you can walk on the lake, do so right to the sw end of the lake, and then get onto the land trail to the teahouse and lookout. If you cannot walk on the lake, take the trail on the north side (right hand side) and follow the lake the 2 km to the sw end of the lake and then continue on the land trail.",
