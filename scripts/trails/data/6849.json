    "description": "The John P. Saylor Trail is realatively flat with gradual climbs in elevation. In the spring the trail is very wet with many springs and streams leading to marshy areas. On parts of the trail there is well preserved evidence of the former railroad grades over the swamp areas. The trail then crosses Clear Shade Creek by a narrow suspension bridge into the Clear Shade wild area. It then passes through a former logging camp.",
    "directions": "The babcock picnic area and the shade creek natural area parking areas are both on Rt 56 W about 2 miles from each other.",
