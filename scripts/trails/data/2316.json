    "description": "A great trail system with something for most skill levels. Mostly singletrack with some very technical sections and man made stunts to keep things interesting. Surface is hard pack with some sandy sections and some parts can get muddy after a heavy rainfall. During the summer, the trailhead parking lot overflows with vehicles just to show how popular these trails are.\r\nThese trails are a must ride for any serious mtn biker.\r\nEnjoy",
    "directions": "From Toronto, 404 north to the end, turn right (east) on Greenlane to Woodbine. Turn left (north) on Woodbine. From Woodbine, turn right on Ravenshoe. From Ravenshoe, turn right (south) on McCowan. Parking lot is on the right approx. 1 km from Ravenshoe",
