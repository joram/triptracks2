    "description": "The Beaver Lake Trail is a 3.2 kilometre loop that is located on the property of the Bayview Wildwood Resort.  A sign at the trailhead indicates that the trail is for the use of resort guests only.  The trail is an easy trail with only a few small hills.  I did the trail in the winter on snowshoes.  The trail visits a couple of small lakes / wetlands before returning back to the trailhead.  There is a nice mix of woodland, open areas, and wetland/lake views.  The trail took me 1 hour to complete with no stops (except to take a view pictures).  It is an excellent trail for those who are new to snowshoeing and a nice short hike for the more experienced snowshoer.  For the majority of the trail the snow was packed by the resort (by snowmobile) to make it a little easier going.",
    "directions": "Go North on South Sparrow Lake Road from Highway 11 (north of Orillia and south of Gravenhurst). After about 10 km on S. Sparrow Lake Road you come to a crossing to Port Stanton Parkway and the Bayview Wildwood Resort - don't take it but enter Torpitt Road to the left. The resort has parking near the tracks across from the resort.  The trail begins just past the building located on your left and is marked with yellow blazes.",
