    "description": "Good loop trail in some of the lesser used areas of Thetis Lake Park. Two peaks, great views of dowtown Victoria, Mt Baker, Gulf Islands....Start at the  end of Stewart Mt Road. Make your way over towards Westoby Road and then up to Scafe Hill where you can look across to Stewart Mt.  Note that the last time I did this just before you get to the top a tree has come down across the trail. You can scramble over to the left of it to get back on to the trail. Go back down the way you came up Scafe and continue on to Stewart for a nice lunch stop. A short  hike back down the back side of Stewart and you are back at the car.",
    "directions": "Go Up Millstream Road and go one street past Finlayson Arm Road. Turn right on to Stewat Mt Road and go to the very end.",
