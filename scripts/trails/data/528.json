    "description": "For years this trail has been popular with the Chilliwack locals--almost as popular as Mt Cheam further up the Chilliwack River Valley.The approach is great. You get to drive the first thousand metres of elevation gain, so this makes it a good short foray into the alpine.  It's about two hours up to the summit of Elk and an hour or so down. It would be more for Thurston, which is a 15 kilometre (7 hour) return trip from the parking lot. To begin, expect a nice open forest of second growth hemlock which is refreshingly cool in the summer. The trail gently gains elevation for the first half hour before it starts to steepen. The last few hundred metres are the steepest, about 35 degrees replete with some stairs. The forest below gives way to alpine fir and Sitka Mountain Ash and even wild strawberries. Views will inspire you to hike even higher. To the north you can see Harrison and Kilby Bay and to the west into the lower Fraser Valley.The final few hundred metres of trail is bluffy and covered with  some loose scree. This is over quickly however and soon you are on top of Elk Mountain near 1500 metres. Here you can see across to the Border Peaks, Slesse Mountain and even into United States. Below, the fine line of the Chilliwack River Road runs through the valley. To the southwest Vedder Mountain, and Cultus Lake beckon. Follow the well-worn trail to Mt Thurston (1627 metres), about one hour or so distant gaining a further 150 metres of elevation.ApproachGet out of Vancouver and head east to Chilliwack, (about an hour). Pass the main exit to Chilliwack and continue toward Hope for less than a couple of kilometres to (Prest Rd. Exit 123). Head south toward the big hill with the sub-division on it for about 4 km and turn left onto Bailey Rd and stay right going uphill on Elk View Road. Follow Elk View Road (the main road) gaining elevation twisting and winding up the pavement until it plateaus and starts climbing again as it turns into a gravel road (Chilliwack Bench FSR). After about 500 metres an obvious pullout appears. Park here. The trail marker signpost indicates the beginning of the trail.",
