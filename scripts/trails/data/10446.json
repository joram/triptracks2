    "description": "The Wapizagonke is renowned for its beautiful landscapes. Steep cliffs, sometimes over one hundred metres high, alternate with inviting sand spits. Once you've gone through Lac Wapizagonke and it's two smaller lakes to the north (~14KM). You will stash your canoe at one of the racks, and head for a 2.5km hike to your campsite which overlooks beautiful Lac Anticagamac sitting below the highest cliffs in the park. The next day, hike back to your canoe and paddle back out.\r\rThis is a fairly easy day of paddling, the hike isn't demanding at all. If you decide to portage your canoe over to Lac Anticagamac, well that would require considerable more effort!",
