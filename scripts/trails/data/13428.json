    "description": "This short hike took me 20 minutes there and back to check out. nice true drop fall of about 12ft.  Ok 12 ft is not that high but the ravine where the fall is located is awesome.  It's covered by moss all over.  The drawback is both sides of the brook have been logged recently.  I only explored there as I was already next door at Grand River fall.",
    "directions": "In Grand River, turn on Barren Hill Road and drive about 1km to the stream crossing.  Follow it downstream for about 500m to the waterfall.",
