    "description": "Epic ride along desolate, scenic back country roads with some spectacular scenery.  This is an organized and supported ride, put together by Tall Tree Cycles in Ottawa.  A great event!The long ride is 155 km, and they also offer a 100 km version.  Either way, it's a long day.  We did the 155 km route with a team of 5.  My battery died before we made to the end of the ride, but the final 20 km weaved through the trails of Gatineau Park back to the start / finish point at Bate Island.",
    "directions": "Starts at Bate Island, between Ottawa and Gatineau, at the North End of Island Park Drive.",
