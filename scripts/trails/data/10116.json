    "description": "If you want a road ride, this is one that is safe, doable, and provides great views of the front ranges of the Eastern Rocky Mountains.  An in-n-out, generally uphill, into the wind on the way out with one big climb (about 600m cumulative climbing) and 62 km return.\r\rThe road is generally pretty quiet and a decent shoulder.  3 Cattle guards to ride across (slats for tires so you're good).  A favorite road for ricecycles to go ripping up and down\r\rYou will be passing all kinds of supremo mountain biking venues, and numerous lookouts, some hiking trailheads and a few interpretive plaques.  At the West end, you will be at Little Elbow recreation area and I think there is a store there to service the campgrounds (check the hours).",
    "directions": "Drive to Bragg Creek (50km WSW of Calgary), park at the mall or anywhere safe.  Go through the NW corner of the mall and out to White Street, head South to Hiway 22.  Head West till you hit a gravel road.  Turn around",
