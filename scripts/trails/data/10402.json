    "description": "Some tough climbing here kids, probably about 600m in 13.5km with the loop shown in the GPS data.  One small hill in the middle, then way up and back down in one, uninterrupted, flow fest.\r\rPrimarily North-West facing slopes of Morrissey Ridge South of Coal Creek.  Starting at the Fernie Aquatic Center & ride SE.  Look for RIDGEMONT ROAD west to climb ROOTS and HYPER VENTILATION, ROOTS.  Can take a more strenuous routing to the trailhead. From the apex of the climb we descended on HYPER EXTENTION and ROOTS EXTENTION (yee haaa). \r\r\r",
    "directions": "Fernie Aquatic Center (park on the street perhaps so you don't fill their lot).  Go into downtown Fernie and go East till you hit the tracks, cross the tracks at 4th Street / Ridgemont Drive and you can't miss the Aquatic center.",
