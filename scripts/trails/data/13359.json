    "description": "A well travelled Route connecting North and South Kananaskis Pass. Route begins by crossing LeRoy Creek from the North Kananaskis Pass Trail. There was a strategically placed log on the trail marking the start of the route when I hiked it, however watch your map/gps carefully because the cutoff otherwise would be difficult to find. Cross LeRoy Creek then hike up a steep, shrubby slope. Route then curves and travels east upslope from Beatty Creek. Exist treed slope and continue on scree. Approx 500m from Beatty Lake Campsite route steepens and becomes quite narrow before travelling off the scree. Beatty Lake Campsite is beautiful and secluded. From here 5km moderate uphill hike to South Kananaskis Pass and Three Isle Lake.",
    "directions": "Start on North Kananaskis Pass trail in Height of the Rockies Provincial Park. Finish at South Kananaskis Pass on border with Peter Lougheed Provincial Park.",
