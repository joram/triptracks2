    "description": "This is one of those roadside falls that a lot of people don't know about.  The fall is well hidden in foliage and the only clue you get that a 50ft fall lies there is either the roar of the water or spotting the guardrails running along the very steep drop at the foot of the fall.You can access the fall from the top and then climb it down or attempt to go more downstream and then walk up the brook.  There is a nice rocky outcrop where you can see the whole two tier falls at once.  However you need to get there for a picture when the foliage is gone.",
    "directions": "Highway 289 south of New Glasgow.  Turn on Mill Brook Rd.  The falls are located downstream of where the brook flows under this road.  there are guardrails on that side! The falls are at;  45\u00b030'40.75\"N,  62\u00b048'35.84\"W",
