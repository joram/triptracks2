    "description": "This hike starts on an old logging road which is invaded by alders.  In a few years this part will not be fun to do.  After about 600m the clearing and road ends in a conifer stand.  There is some sign of an old road in the forest as well but the many game trails especially the ones close to the Gold River are your best bet.  Final destination for this hike is this massive white spot I could see on the satellite imagery.The part of the hike in the conifer forest is about 1km long so a total of close to 4km return.  There aren?t any hard part on this hike and the final destination offers a used camping spot.  The waterfall I saw (the white spot!) was massive as I was there during the spring freshet.  The fall is wide and about 15 ft tall.  There is a swinging rope downstream of the fall and that with the camping spot upstream makes this a good camping location in the summer.",
    "directions": "Highway 12 to New Ross. Turn on Glengarry Road and continue until there is a sharp 90 degree turn on the road.  Park there and follow the woods road leading you in a south direction.",
