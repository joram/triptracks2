    "description": "This is a short trail, right along the highway to Twillingate. Park on the small parking area and head in. Keep to your left and eventually will come to a set of stairs. Follow these up to a great viewpoint with nice views of the many islands nearby. When you come down from the stairs, keep left to continue the loop around a small pond. \r\rThis is a good trail for anyone with an hour to spare and pretty much anyone can do it. Elevation gain is at most 200'.",
    "directions": "On the road into Summerford heading north, on your right, well signed.",
