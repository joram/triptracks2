    "description": "This is a very nice fall to see but there is no trail to it so you are looking at about 2.5km of bushwack by a small river in the middle of Cape Breton.  The first 500m is the worst as the forest is quite dense...it becomes easier after that all the way to the fall.  \n\nThere is a house on one side of the river so please use the opposite bank to make your way upstream.   There is an old woods road you can take to bypass some of the river walk.  Have a look at my gps and try to follow it to save you some heartache.   The fall is quite unexpected and beautiful at the end of a hemlock filled ravine.",
