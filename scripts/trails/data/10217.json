    "description": "Because the Duckabush hike is in a river valley on the Olympic peninsula, it can be done any time of year. Not certain if the trailhead clogs up with snow in the winter. Hike along river with one large hill, then get to '5-mile camp' where you can pitch a tent.",
    "directions": "Take ferry across from Seattle to US 101, drive north. After 37 miles or so, go west (left) onto Duckabush road. Follow road and park near horse unloading lot. Or drive further up FSR 2510 to find the real trailhead.",
