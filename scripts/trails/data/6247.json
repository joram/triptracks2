    "description": "The trail starts in good tree coverage for a short bit.  Then the trail follows a open rock ridge (no shade here) with a steady incline up to the first look out area.  There is one part (only about 20-30ft) where there is a narrow bit only about 4ft wide.  From here there is a great view of the Valley and both upper and lower lakes.  You can continue on into the trees (less incline for a while).  Then you will come across a well worn trail that will take you up to the summit.  There is lots of nice views along the way, including more of the lakes and a nice one of a basin with a small pnd in it.  The trip to the summit gets steep again.  You'll lose the trees and eventually get into some scrambling to the top.",
    "directions": "Head to the Kanninaskis Lakes on highway 40.  The trail starts at the upper Kanninaskis upper lake north parking lot.   Head up the north trail and cross the concrete bridge.  The trail head starts less than 100 M from the bridge (your first right).  The trail head is a bit overgrown and has large rocks blocking it.  Once you get past it it opens up and is very well maintained.",
