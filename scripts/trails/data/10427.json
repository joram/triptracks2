    "description": "The trail is well maintained, it is gravel most of the way. It is an easy hike and pretty close to the city. Because it is so close to the city, you can hear traffic from the highway the whole hike. So if you?re looking to hear nature and escape the city hassle this may not be the trail for you. The hike was nice though with Lake Charles visible most of the time. There are elevation changes but nothing to drastic, a great trail for biking, running or just hiking.",
