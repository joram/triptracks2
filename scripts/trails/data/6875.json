    "description": "A SUPER FUN network of trails that only rarely smell like their namesake.  You can make any length of ride you want and you're never very far from the trailhead, plus there are only moderate elevation changes (maybe 100m from highest to lowest), so this is a good trail for anyone that wants to bike ride off the roads.\r\rThere are many interconnected trails and they are generally very buff singletrack, some of the nicest I've ridden in Montana.  Nicely flowey, no long climbs and all rideable.  There are one or two gated roads running through the area as well if you want to stay on wider tracks.\r\rAs mentioned, this is a network, so it would be fairly easy to get lost in them, always keep your bearings and remember the parking is roughly in the North East corner (180 degrees away from the sun in the afternoon).",
    "directions": "Go West/North up hiway 93 from downtown Whitefish about 6km to secondary road 424 and turn East (left).  Drive about 10.5km to trailhead on left.",
