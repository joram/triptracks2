    "description": "A short hike near St Peters to a mostly unknown two-tier waterfall.  This one involves bushwacking in a recently logged area.  And yes it will be bushwacking as the area is covered by prickly bushes of all kinds.  At the end of the logged area you enter the forest but there is a lot of deadfall.  You eventually meet up with the small stream and think OMG this is too small to have anything on.  However a minute or two later you stand in front of the beautiful two tier fall.",
    "directions": "In St Peter?s take highway 247 towards Fourchu.  Park at the logged area at; 45.636937,-60.850356",
