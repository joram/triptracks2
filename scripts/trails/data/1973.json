    "description": "The trail to Admiralty Point offers a lovely seaside walk in Belcarra Regional Park. \r\nEditor's note: There are other listings (with maps) of Belcarra regional park on trailpeak, but these google earth image shots are so cool, we just had to let this submission go through.  Use the trailpeak search engine to find Belcarra by placing it's name in \"trail name\".  Closest large city is Vancouver, B.C., or Port Coquitlam, B.C.\r\n\r\nFor directions, follow these other listings on trailpeak.  Ok, here they are (but we still want you to get used to our search engine):\r\n\r\n1. Belcarra Regional Park\r\n2. Jug Island - Belcarra Park\n\r\nThere are reviews, maps, and more pics, enjoy!\r",
