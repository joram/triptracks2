    "description": "This trail has many great attributes making it a favorite among locals and visitors. The calming rush of the creek, the huge cedar trees, the lookout overlooking Valemount and surrounding mountains, the lichen, mushrooms and other plant life, plus the new suspension bridge! There are some very steep sections covered in pine needles and it?s hard to grip unless you?re wearing good hiking shoes. Hiking poles are recommended here. Watch for falling trees. If you?re biking, there are lots of roots and some deadfall. You?ll find yourself skirting around, over and under dead trees especially close to the logging block. On the southwest side of the creek, the ground is often mucky, and you have to bushwack among poky devil?s club ? ouch! Bears are sometimes spotted along this trail in spring and summer. Be sure to make lots of noise so you don?t surprise them. You can sometimes spot bright red and green Sockeye salmon spawning in the creek just below the weir during September. Keep yourself and your pets out of the water as not to disturb the delicate salmon nests. This trail is being developed into a multi-use mountain bike trail, likely in spring/summer 2015.",
