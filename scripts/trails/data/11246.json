    "description": "The trail is very well marked and maintained. The majority of the hike is slightly uphill and eventually leads you to the cedar loop (this part if flat). Before you arrive at the loop, there is a beautiful outlook on your left the look down on Showh Lakes.  Once you get to Cedar Loop you walk into the valley to has sheltered these giant cedars for what they estimate to be 700 to 1000 years old. The loop is not very long and after you complete it, you walk the same path back down to the parking lot. This trail is on Cougar mountain and because of this it is dog friendly. It can be difficult to get to this hike during the winter as it is on a logging road and the snowfall can make in inaccessible.",
    "directions": "Drive North and Highway 99 towards Pemberton. As Green Lake is on your right, continue on until you come to the end of Green Lake. At this point look to your left for a logging road now named Cougar Mountain Rd. There is a Zip Lining company that also is on this road so you can loop for their signage as well. Once you turn onto this road, drive straight for approximately 4.5km. You will pass the zip line and four wheeling company on your right. At the top of the road, the trail and parking lot is well marked.",
