    "description": "No wonder why it is so popular here. We always go in the mountains usually but since it is much closer and skiing for a shorter period of time with this cold, we thought we?d give WBC a shot. As per their website, they have 50 km of groomed trails and plenty of parking spaces. Off-leash sections, families, some multi-sports trails all impact the trackset conditions but they?re usually good. Hilly forested terrain makes it for maybe 150-300 metres elevation total when going for 10 km+. We went back the next day and so far, I loved East Crystal Line-Iron Springs on the way up down Elbow-Sundog for about 11 km. We still have to explore the bigger loops like Mountain View. This is a gem if you don?t have time to head out in the Mountains. Most trails are easy-intermediate.",
    "directions": "From Bragg Creek (Highway 22 Intersection), turn right on Balsam Ave and continue for about 500 m. At the intersection, turn left on Centre Ave and continue 8.9 km to the West Bragg Creek Day Use Area. There are plenty of parking spaces either side.",
