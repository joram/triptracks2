    "description": "The trail is located by Azouzetta Lake in the Pine Pass. It is steep but short. Once you grunt through the first 2.5 km, you will find yourself in the alpine with amazing views of the Pine Valley and Azouzetta Lake. The hike finishes at the top of the ridge with rewarding views of a couple of alpine lakes and surrounding mountain ranges to the east and the Pine Valley to the west. One can also continue to hike along the ridge either to the north / south or head down to one of the alpine lakes to explore further.",
    "directions": "Head north from Prince George, BC. Turn right onto the gravel road 300 m after  Azouzetta Lake Lodge. Drive another 700 m to a pull out on the left. Park your car there. The trail starts on the other side of the gravel road. Look for small log bridge to cross the ditch/stream. Then cross the railway tracks and hike along the vegetated berm paralleling the train tracks (follow the flagging) until you are on the north side of the gully. The trail then hugs the side of the gully and gets steep. Once up in the alpine the trail is less defined. Continue heading toward the ridge.",
