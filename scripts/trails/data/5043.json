    "description": "The East trail is very difficult, from the start it climbs and climbs up the East ridge.  In 5.3 km the elevation gain is 1135 meters. Once at the top you can take the 9 km trail down a lot easier but the views are not as impressive as on the way up.  Be very careful - there is a rope section as well as a scrambling section.",
    "directions": "On Highway 40 take the turn into Twin Falls.  Drive about 200-300 meters up the power line to the trailhead.  There is a sign that says Hamell East Ridge Route. Take and you're on your way!!",
