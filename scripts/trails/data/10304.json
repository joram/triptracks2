    "description": "A hike through the Okanagan forsest from Mahoney Lake to White Lake. It's not a loop, but you could make it a one way trip starting at either end and arrange pick up at the other end.In September the forest was very dry, passed lots of bear poop but didn't see any bears, or rattle snakes either.Okanagan soil is sandy so there were places where a bike might get stuck. Another option using the bike would be ride the trail one way and loop back to your vehicle on roads. It would be a long ride (20 km) but these roads are generally not very busy.A variety of forest terrain as well as a view of the Penticton Observatory radio Telescope.Bike shop / rentals: Freedom Bike Shop Accomodations: Summerland Resort",
    "directions": "Two trail heads:Mahoney lake, on the Green Lake Road, the yellow gate just north of the pull out for Mahoney Lake.White lake road Kiosk, park at the sign and take the obvious trail towards the lake.",
