    "description": "White Rock which is what the West side of Kalamalka Lake along the railways tracks is know as, despite most of it being along or on the tracks, is popular with a variety of people. White Rock is used by fisherman, hikers and dog walks but, for over 60 years has been Vernon's Clothing Optional area. A number of people have built small beach areas along the bank of the lake to meet and sunbath. There are very few trains on this route and the odd one that does travel there, is moving very slow because they are aware of the number of people in the area. If you do visit this area be aware you are going to meet nude sunbathers, walkers and hikers. Textiles and naturalists co-mingle without problems and other than the odd pass-by in a boat, the police leave everyone but parties in the evening, alone.",
    "directions": "Travel to the end of WestKal Road and park. Be aware of the no parking area right at the end of the road. The very end of the road is no parking to give room for vehicles using the boat launch and is actively patrolled. Once you are parked, find one of trails on the right side that lead up the bank to the tracks. The best one is towards the end of the road. Once on the tracks, go South (left) along the tracks. In about 200 meters you will travel through a cut in the bank. From this area onwards is the clothing optional area. If you are a nude hiker this is the place to lose the clothes. Once through the cut, you will be traveling along the lake and if you look over the bank you will start to see small beach areas though, the majority of naturalists travel down a bit further. For about 1km there are numerous small beach areas then you travel about 1km till you find the next group. You can travel all the way down to the Kekuli Bay provincial park and I think it would be about a 1 1/2 hour hike.",
