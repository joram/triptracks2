    "description": "It's February, and to further our \"paddle every month of the year\" adventure, we headed back to Souris, PEI where we heard claims of open water.\r\n\r\nIan MacAdam and myself (shannon Burt) found the easiest access and most open water by climbing the boulders of the Government warf and launching our boats that way.\r\n\r\nThis was our second month winter paddling in Souris, the first time, launching at the causeway. It seems that in winter, Souris is your best bet in PEI if you want to get in some paddling during the winter.\r\n\r\nEnjoy the pictures. We enjoyed the adventure!\r\n\r\nshannon B.
