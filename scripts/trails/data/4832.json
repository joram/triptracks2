    "description": "This trail is a stacked set that originates from the Amherst Shore Camp Ground. One trail takes you to the beach through an old apple orchard and through a tunnel under the highway.The other set of trails center around a creek / estuary where the forest is lush and green. What's nice about these trails is that although the tracks near the trailhead are obsessively wide, you get rewarded as you venture about fifteen minutes beyond, where things fill in, and campsite visitors rarely venture beyond.I found this trail to be perfect for trail running, or simply hiking. If I had a mountain bike, it would be a fun ride, though a bit easy.Access the trail out of season is questionable due to the campground / provincial park being closed, though there is the trail running under the main road, and it's an obvious landmark.We routinely camp at Amherst Shore every Canada day weekend as our first night of our winery tour. Our site is probably the richest smelling spot come supper time with fresh ingredients and well paired wines from Bay Verte Wine Garden, a German winery no less than 10K from the campground.Shannon BurtEast coast editor",
