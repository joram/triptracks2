    "description": "This is a largely unknown waterfall minutes from Bedford or Sackville.  I spotted it in an old report which was describing the hydro capabilities of the Sackville River.  The document was written in the 1880's!Like a lot of my posts, this is largely a bushwhack to the end point (the fall).  The woods are thick and not fun to traverse.  On the way back, I stayed close to the river and was pleasently surprised to find a faint game (or fishing) trail.  At the falls, themselves, there is a little cabin and an ATV trail...I am not sure where it leads but probably back to highway 101.The fall are small compared to the Cobequids but a decent size for the Halifax region.",
    "directions": "Exit 2A on the 101 highway.  Turn to the west (towards McCabe lake) and follow the pved road the furthest that you can.  Then aim for the river and follow it upstream to approx 44.796995, -63.779235",
