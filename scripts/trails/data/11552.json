    "description": "A nice short hike to a beautiful waterfall.   Setting off from the dirt road, I thought I would have to plow through a logged area but I was pleasantly surprised to follow a flagged ATV trail all the way to the fall.  Lots of raspberry bushes in full fruit in mid-July here!  The first part os flat and as been logged and the last part is set in a nice confer dominated forest as you descend a moderate hill to the base of the fall.  Lots of rock walls aropund the fall but not high enough for climbing.",
    "directions": "TCH to Kings Landing Exit.  turn on MacLean Rd and continue until its gravel conclusion and then continue as it becomes narrower and more and more pot holes are present.  The fall you are looking for is on Jewett Creek at 19 T 658274 5079682",
