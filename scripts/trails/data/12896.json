    "description": "I often work on the Roseway River near Lower Ohio.  A lot of the times when I am there, I can see some foam on the river.  I always wanted to explore upstream to see if there was a waterfall creating the foam.I checked the sat imagery and topo map and found an area further upstream that could have some potential for falls.  I set off on a woods road for 400m and then bushwacked my way to the river.  The forest changes from mature softwood to very clustered small trees.  Along the river its all mature hardwood and very nice top walk through.  along the river, I noticed some flagging tape which suggest paddlers were portaging here yahoooo!Ok so there wasn't massive falls here but the area of my gps track contains a lot of step falls or rapids which depending on the time of the season might not be easy to paddle down and hence the trail.",
