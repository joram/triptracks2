    "description": "This is a great trail to get to near Kearney Lake.  There might be a lot of people on the trail at first near Kearney Lake but as you venture out more, you will have the place to yourself.  Any signage is good to look at as you need to get to the Fox Lake look-off (N44\u00b0 41' 04.8\" W63\u00b0 42' 16.9\").  At the look-off is all kinds of bouldering opportunities especially if you are looking towards the lake, it will be to your left.\n\nAfter the look-off the official trail continues another 200m or so and then the trail becomes the EVIL BIRCH!   Nice section of mountain biking to be had here with lots of boulders to jump, constructed ramps in a few spot, one of which is a drop of at least 7ft!  If you continue all the way on this trail, you eventually cross a small brook draining Quarry Lake towards Washmill Lake.  The Bad Luck falls (N44\u00b0 40' 29.2\" W63\u00b0 41' 01.9\") occur right here downstream of the bridge.  It's more of a cascade type of falls and the name I took from some maps!",
