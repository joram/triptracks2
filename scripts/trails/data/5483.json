    "description": "Only 15 minutes off the highway to Pacific Rim National Park, this trail goes through 50 year old second growth to some old growth Douglas fir and then to a really nice view of the Taylor Arm portion of Sproat Lake. The trail was made 5-6 years ago and has started to grow in so a sharp eye for the trail is recommended. The trail is marked with plastic ribbon hanging from branches. I recommend you download the GPS version of the route!",
    "directions": "400 m east of the turn off to Sproat Lake Provincial Park, Turn North onto the logging road to Great Central Lake. Turn left 1.5 km down the road. You will be paralleling the highway. Stay on this road about 3.2 km till you get to a dead end. There is plenty of room to turn around here. You are then at the trail head.",
