    "description": "This is one of my early explorations.  I was actually looking for the Vault (cave) and stumbled upon this series of waterfalls.  I posted some pictures on panoramio (now defunct).  An ice climber contacted me about the falls to ask about the heights.  Because the picture didn?t have any people in it, there was a lack of perspective.  The climber was a bit put off when I told him the height ranged from 5-15ft only.Anyways it?s still a nice spot to visit.  The waterfalls are quite scenic but again only go when it?s been raining or when the snow is melting.",
