    "description": "There is a total of 7 trails within the network, ranging from short/easy 1 km trails to the longest loop which is roughly 9 km, involving 4 trails.\nThe longest loop can be achieved by going the length of the Post Road, turning right on to the Wetland Trail, at roughly 3/4 mark of the Wetland Trail turn right again and go the length of the Barrens Trail, finally turn right one last time and conclude with the Red Spruce Trail. \nTrail conditions on these four trails range from a easy, wide and level trail to moderate, narrow, root covered trails. This loop can be done in 3 hrs with a few short breaks. You encounter three lakes and a few streams along this route.\nThe park is also the site of a country estate built between 1813 to 1815 and is open in the summer for viewing.",
    "directions": "The park is located in Mount Uniacke, on Route 1 Nova Scotia, roughly 25-35 minutes from Halifax.\nThe link below to the park Museum website offers information on the park and directions.\nhttp://museum.gov.ns.ca/uemp/default.htm",
