    "description": "Fairly easy hike that doesn't require a lot of time. Not used a lot so you can enjoy the quiet.",
    "directions": "From Kamloops, head East on the Trans Canada. Take the Barnhartvale exit and then right on Todd. Travel 3km and turn right on Pratt Rd. Travel 3.4km to the end of the road and park at the yellow gate. The trail goes between the fences of two properties.At the first fork in the road, go left. At the second, also go left. If you go right, in a short distance you can take a trail on the right and hike down into the valley to Campbell Creek Rd. Continue to the left, following the fence. After the fence a short distance, take the trail on the left. Continue up the main trail until you are getting close to the top. The trail then splits, stay to the right. Continue up the hill to the summit.The trail down is not well established and in some places, disappears all together so I have marked it with yellow ribbon. If you do lose sight of the trail, continue down the hill and bear to the right. Further down the trail cuts to the right parallel to the hill so you should hit it in a short distance. The trail going across joins up with the road and is better established, but I marked it as well.",
