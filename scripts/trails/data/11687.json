    "description": "A short hike to a spectacular fall in an area you wouldn't have guessed there was a fall.  The trail follows an old coach road and circumvents a property. The owners of the property allow hikers but no ATV as the sign proclaims.  The trail is set in a nice hardwood and then softwood forest and it climbs the whole way.  At about 10min from the main road, there is a side spur to the left you need to take this and this leads you to the top of the 60ft waterfall.  The fall follows the rock face and it looks like a natural water slide.  A deep pool is set at the bottom where the stream turns 90 degrees.",
    "directions": "Highway 1 to Clementsport.  Park at the Iron monument and walk west for about 135m where a small trail is set on a steep slope just behind a small stand of conifers",
