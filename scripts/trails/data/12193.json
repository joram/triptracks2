    "description": "Edwards Rating: I (II - Maybe III in winter) S S3 to 5 hoursElevation of 709 m NET, 740 m TOT & max 2387 mHiking or snowshoeing *****This is probably our favorite short winter hike so far. The views of surrounding peaks and Kananaskis Lakes made it a memorable day!  We did not have snowshoes but the trail was really good. We brought spikes and used them to run down the hill. There are a few places where the trail is exposed to steep snow slopes or close to the cliff and 2-3 steps before the summit where the ridge is narrow with a cornice on your right, be careful there. It makes it a moderate winter scramble but probably easy in summer time.We crossed Smith Dorrien Trail from the parking lot and got to the TransAlta road for about 1.1 km. At the end, you will see a snowshoe sign on your right. We crossed the stream and turned left to take the steepest trail where we saw a few pink or orange flags. From there, it is almost straight up and soon enough, you will have beautiful views of King Creek Ridge and the peaks behind as well as some great viewpoints of Kananaskis Lakes. You will be along the cliff most of the time. This is quite popular as we met four groups on our way down.",
    "directions": "From Calgary, follow Trans-Canada Hwy/AB-1 W to Kananaskis Trail/AB-40 S and take exit 118. Drive south for about 50 km and turn right on Kananaskis Trail/AB-742. Drive 2.2 km to the Smith Dorrien Trail junction and turn right for another 3 km approx. Park on the left side of the road, soon after the pond and just in front of the TransAlta road.",
