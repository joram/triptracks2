    "description": "It was very wet the day when we did this hike but still very beautiful.  Others people on the hike said they  have done the hike in all seasons.  We went to the ridge first and then down to the lake.   There was a cabin there but it was in the middle of being replaced when we did the hike.  Lots of climbing, not a hike for the inexperienced.",
    "directions": "85 km from Prince George and then a long way down Hungry Creek Road.  Watch the signs as there is a turn off to Grizzly Den which is another hike in the area.",
