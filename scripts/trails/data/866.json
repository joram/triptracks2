    "description": "This is a good winter training hill (for bikers or hikers), 900 feet of vertical straight up then some up and down then a long descent in the woods. The first mile is on sidewalk then gravel and finally single track. The descent is on an old logging road, that the overgrowth has been kept clear of by a farmer.  The descent has some steep sections but for the most part anyone can clean this hill. When the rest of the trails around here get muddy this trail is still passable. \nClick on \"Download GPS\" to see a makeshift map created by recording the route with my GPS.  If you have a GPS, download the data and use it as a base-map to know you are on the trail, or put the GPS in track-back mode and it will create a series of waypoints and guide you.",
    "directions": "Find Old Yale Road in Abbotsford. Head to the east side of Abbotsford, staying on Old Yale till you get to the Eagle Mt. development.  You can't miss it. Eagle Mt. is where the \"Street of Dreams\" was in 2003. Turn north and head up the hill. For parking, anywhere should be fine. Follow this road to the top, and when you get to the gravel continue past the switch back and take the second opening to the left. You will see a large pile of potting soil someone has discarded.   Turn right here.  This is where the single track starts.  Just follow the main trail.  If this all sounds confusing, grab a GPS and download the attached track, using your GPS to find the route. Enjoy.",
