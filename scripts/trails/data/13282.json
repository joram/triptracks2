    "description": "A beautiful wildeness trail right alongside the Nictaux River with the added bonus of an abandoned river structure along the way!The first part of the hike will take you down the 'rails to trails' that runs from Middleton to Bridgewater.  After crossing the Hwy 10 there are several opportunities to turn off the old railbed toward the river.  These paths are not maintained but travelled enough to remain visible.  There is a narrow 'bridge' that crosses a small creek and as you follow the trail you'll hear some rushing water up ahead.  Be sure to check it out as you'll find an abandoned dam crossing the river.",
    "directions": "From Middleton, take Hwy 10 south across the Annapolis River.  The parking/staging area will be on the right hand side just before you get to the bottom of the South Mountain.",
