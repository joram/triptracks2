    "description": "A nice foothills hike, especially in the fall.  This trail is a loop option instead of out and back to Eagle Hill Trail but leaving from the same location. The official trail follows mixed forest through old cutlines and exploration roads over mixed terrain.  The bottom could be swampy in wet fall weather with the top snowy and the south hillsides bare and dry. See deer, grouse, skunks, and many varieties of birds.  The middle third of the trail grinds up ~200m in elevation to great views looking south along Powderface trail and then just as quickly descents into the low mixed bush.",
    "directions": "Park at the Eagle Hill trail parking lot just west of the Sibbald Lake campground from the same side road.",
