    "description": "Invergary Park is North Surrey's Bike Park.  It has a number of features on a short network of trails with about 50-100 feet of vertical. There are a number of gap jumps with a few sections of multiple jumps in a row.  There are also a few drops ranging from 2 foot to 10 feet.  It is a good area to practice your riding skills.   Below the bike park is a deep ravine with a few trails that lead down into it.  Some of the trails can be made into a loop.  Below in the ravine there is also an old dam that has been washed out.",
    "directions": "Take 152nd exit from Hwy 1 to 108 Ave West.  At 148st turn right drive to 111A street and turn left, park at the corner of 146 street. The bike park is just below this corner in the forest.",
