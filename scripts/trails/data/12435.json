    "description": "Here is a nice sets of falls on the Monastery Brook.  Leaving the road, you enter the mixed forest and follow the brook upstream to two sets of falls.  Both falls can be visited in about 500m in distance.  What makes this place special is that they are not a lot of known fall in the general vicinity probably due to the lack of elevation loss and geology.   You aslo get to pass right by of one the few NS monastery.",
