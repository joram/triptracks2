    "description": "NTS Map: 092G08The Lions backcountry ski trail follows the same route, for the most part, as the famous hiking trail that many summer hikers take to visit the \"Lions\" - two volcanic plugs that are visible from the Vancouver area.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo start your trip, follow the upper levels highway (Hwy 99 towards Whistler), but before you leave West Vancouver, and certainly before you reach Horseshoe Bay, you'll see a sign for the Cypress Bowl ski area. Take that road to the top, and inquire up top as to the best entrance to the route. Our GPS track is available should you request it. You should be an experienced backcountry skier, and you will want to take a map, compass, GPS unit, and the usual avalanche safety equipment with you.\r",
