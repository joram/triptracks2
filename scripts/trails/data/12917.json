    "description": "This is a short hike to some seldom visited falls on Totten Brook.  A long time ago I had followed a hunch and bushwhacked my way along this brook to some very pitiful waterfalls.   I decided there must be something better on this brook...and I was right!I started off in a logged area full of blackberry canes...that wasn't fun at all but soon I was on the edge of a small ravine and the logging stopped.  A short hike upstream seems like a good idea since the ravine walls were closing on each side of the brook.  After a few hundred metres, I was standing in front of a three tier, waterfall.  They might be approximately 8,  ft each in height but the setting and the ease of getting there make it worthwhile.  also, just new door to the west is Pine Brook which has a couple of significant fall to see too!",
    "directions": "In Debert, take the Upper Debert River Road to its end.  turn right on E Folly Man Rd.  Cross Totten Brook after 1.2km and turn left on logging road after about 1.6km after the intersection of upper desert river Rd.  Drive until your gps point you  close to the waterfalls which are at; 45\u00b029'39.5\"N 63\u00b027'58.7\"W",
