    "description": "The Subway is a strenuous and demanding backcountry hike. Permit required.(Zion NP)Know before you go, as with any backcountry trail. Pack appropriately, although the Subway is only a day hike, your list should include: plenty of water, energy sustaining snacks, sunblock, a good hat..... Check the weather forecast. Leave no trace.",
    "directions": "From Springdale, drive south and west 14 miles to the town of Virgin. Turn right (north) on the Kolob Reservoir Road (KR road, sometimes called the Kolob Terrace (KT) road). The paved KR road winds through town, then climbs a dramatic ridge in making its way to Kolob Terrace. Six and a half miles from Virgin, the road enters the park and three trailheads are soon encountered ? the Right Fork, Grapevine Springs, then the Left Fork. Park at the Left Fork Trailhead.",
