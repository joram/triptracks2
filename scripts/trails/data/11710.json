    "description": "From the parkign lot at the top of the escarpment take the metal stairs and exit on the right on the Bruce Trail.  Walk about 1km through the deciduous forest until you are next ot the tee off section of the golf course.  The Chedoke  falls are inside the gorge in front of you.  There are two falls upstream one of about 20 ft and the other of about  45 ft.  There is no set trail so scramble as best you can to the waterfalls.  At the top fall, you can exit to the street above using a faint trail on your left (if looking upstream).",
    "directions": "Scenic Rd in Hamilton to Upper Paradise St parking lot.  The stairs are close to the parking lot at 43.244593,-79.906654.",
