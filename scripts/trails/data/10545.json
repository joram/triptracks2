    "description": "The topography is fascinating.  Crevaces, ice cave, green glacial lake, meandering mountain stream, alpine flowers, waterfalls, glacial debree and even a stunning green-iced glacier.  All this within a mile and a half.  \nElevation gain is moderate and the trail is rated an easy walk.",
    "directions": "To reach the Edith Cavell Trail drive south of Jasper on the Icefields Parkway (highway 93) 5 miles and take the well-marked turnoff onto highway 93A.  \nCross the Astoria River and continue 28 kilometers (16 miles) on the mountain road that winds its way to the trailhead.  The road is not suitable for trailers which can be left at the parking lot near the highway.",
