    "description": "Hematoma and Spring Cleaning: \r\nTrail length: 1km\r\nLevel of Difficulty: Hematoma - Most difficult  / Spring Cleaning -difficult\r\n\r\nRating: Hematoma 4/5  Spring cleaning 3.5/5\r\nA short uphill from town, go straight uphill from the flashing light to 4th, \r\ngo right to the dead end, go left  but bear right after 100 metres.  This is Columbia-Kootenay rd. and it takes you to a gate that you ride around.  Head  to the clearing on the right (200m from the gate).  You will see four \r\ntailheads.  From left to right they are Hematoma, Red Dwarf, Spring Cleaning and Cemetery.  Hematoma has some 60 degree rock faces, lots of steep sandy \r\nchutes and a bunch of high speed twisty turnies.  It puts you out onto the highway(3B) which is about 2km from town up a steep hill - not too bad if you \r\nare patient...and fit.  Spring Cleaning is a tamed down version of Hematoma with a few more loose rocky sections.  This trail spits you out onto the highway in the same spot as Hematoma.  Both of these trails can be ripped in \r\nunder 10 minutes if you flow them.",
