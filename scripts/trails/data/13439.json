    "description": "This is a short-ish hike of 4km to a series of falls on MacLennan Brook.  The walk to the fall from Meadows Road is easier if you try to move away from the brook and into the forest.  The side of the brook are full of smaller shrubs while the forest is not exactly pen but is better than the brook shoreline.\n\nI didn't have enough time after exploring French River for longer hikes and was returning home when I decided to check this brook.  Why you may ask?  Well I had a waypoint in my GPS since the topography along the upper section of the brook looked awesome for waterfalls.  Within a very short distance the brook looses a lot of elevation all at once.\n\nAfter bushwacking all the way to the side of the mountain, I finally saw a series of falls and cascades too numerous to count.  There is never a fall of more than 20 -25 ft but the series of them makes this a gorgeous area to explore.  Only go after a rainfall as it may go a bit drier in the summer time.",
