    "description": "I finally had the opportunity to explore a small brook near Cape North.  I had seen the sat imagery and spotted a few potential falls but I needed to ground truth the place.  I was in the area and set off at a dry time of the year.  This is good since the walking in the brook is easy on the huge boulders located everywhere.  Soon I came up to a huge rock set in the middle of the river with trees growing on it.  I went farther upstream and soon my reward was in front of me.  A super nice multi tier cascade type fall with a huge pool in front of it.  \n\nI went further upstream to my second waypoint and wasn\u2019t disappointed.  What this fall lacked in height in made up in the scenic aspect.  A slide fall drops into pool that has a huge rocky overhand...like a private hot tub with a roof!   And no, the water is not warm at all!  Then it the brook plunges a last 3 ft fall into another large pool.",
