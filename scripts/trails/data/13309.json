    "description": "Wow!   What an awesome area located really close to the old highway 201 in Tupperville.  A fellow explorer (P. Capstick) was kind enough to share this with me a few weeks ago.   I have since learned that some of these boulders are known in the climbing community as well.The whole hill is covered by some really large erratics but there is one little sweet pocket where the majority of the bigger ones lie.  These boulders vary in size and the largest ones would be as high as a house.   Some of them are already clean while others have lots of ferns covering some of the sides.  The forest around the majority of the sweet spot is also very open and easy to travel through.  Other areas on the top of the hill have much more deadfall are are a bit harder to bushwhack through.  although those areas might hide some good boulders as well.",
    "directions": "Highway 201.  From Bridgetown.  Travel west towards Annapolis Royal.  Park where the highway crosses Bent Brook (44\u00b047'36.9\"N 65\u00b022'41.0\"W).  Walk upstream of Bent Brook from the highway a few hundred metres. The large boulders are just to the west of  Bent Brook.",
