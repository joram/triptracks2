    "description": "Completed on Feb 18, 2017 when mostly snow covered.Edwards Rating: I (II) S S (probably I (I) when dry)2.5 to 5 hours.Elevation of 719 m NET, 738 m TOT & max 2231 m.GPS track involves some easy bushwhacking/route finding as it was snow covered most of the time and we went down the west slopes to take advantage of snow patches. *****We thought this was Stony Ridge but we enjoyed that hike a lot anyways. Higher than Stony and it is really a nice long ridge walk. We didn?t have a clear sky but we?ve seen the views from Gunnery Mountain before and it?s awesome! The snow and ice was not a problem and we actually left the ridge early on our way down to enjoy some incredible glissades on snow patches. Starting from the road we cut straight up to attain the beginning of that ridge right away. No warm up as it is a steep grassy slope and we went through some easy scrambling on and around slabs where ice wouldn?t always allow us to go straight up though. We then followed the ridge all the way to the summit. After a short break because of the clouds and wet snow, we went back down the same way and then used our satellite map to find ways down the west side of the ridge using long snow patches to slide down and lose elevation quickly. The bushwhacking was easy even though we lost some time sidesloping always trying to find the next snow patch to use. I strongly recommend that ridge and it seems to be accessible and doable all year round.",
    "directions": "From Calgary, follow Trans-Canada Highway/AB-1 W, take exit 161A for AB-22 S toward Bragg Creek/Redwood Meadows and go south for about 88 km following directions to stay on AB-22 S. Just before Longview, turn right onto Highway 541 for 42.4 km where we parked on the right side of the road right after the SE end of the ridge.",
