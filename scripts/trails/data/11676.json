    "description": "Tis is  hike to a series of waterfalls ranging from 10-30ft on the Churn Brook, guys borough County, Nova Scotia.    From the western end of the logging road to the falls, there is actually an old logging road which becomes an ATV trail which leads you right to the the Churn Brook.  I was planning to do  1km bushwhack but was pleasantly surprised by a 1km return ATV trail all the way to the brook.  Once at the brook, I went upstream which was a mistake....there is a small fall or two upstream that are about 5-10ft hight.  The prize is located downstream where there is a series of 4  falls all of which are a good 30ft.  There are all different,,,,true plunges, sliders, changing directions, plunge pool...they are all there...all surrounded by a mature evergreen forest.  No wonder this land is now protected under NS Nature Trust...it's a unique gem four this gore",
    "directions": "Highway 347 to West Side River Rd and drive until the alders are too thick about....N45 14.762 W62 10.745 nd continue ion the faint AT trail all the way to Churn Brook",
