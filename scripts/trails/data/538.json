    "description": "A peak experience--on top of the world! The dominant peak at the eastern end of the Fraser Valley is now accessible from its back side.  Out in the open the whole time, the trail zig-zags its way up and through lush meadows to the gravelly terrain near the top.  Unsurpassed views all round.\nCheam is 9.5 KM round trip,       High point is 2112 m (6929 ft)                                                Elevation gain 665 m (2175 ft).\nCaution:  There are sheer drops near the top.  Take care up there! \nThere is GPS data attached to this trail (see \"download GPS\"), which if loaded into your GPS can help you find route points.",
    "directions": "Highway 1 Exit 119A (Sardis/Vedder). South on Vedder Rd. until you reach the Vedder Bridge.  Turn left onto Chilliwack Lake Rd. Set your odometer to \"0\" at the Vedder Bridge.  At 27km, turn left on Foley Forest Service Rd.  Zero your odometer again and drive 2 km, cross the bridge over Foley Creek and turn left at the T-junction.  2km further cross Chipmunk Creek Bridge and take the next right uphill (passing the gravel pit on your left) on Chipmunk Creek Forest Service Rd.  This is a rough road with many cross ditches, but not too steep for the first 7km.  Keep right after crossing Chipmunk Creek.  The road is rougher and steeper (4x4 recommended) for the final 4km to the parking area.  Orange squares mark the route.",
