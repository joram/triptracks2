    "description": "There are six different marked, colored trails in Janes Island State Park.  All are situated in the more than 30 miles of water trails that dissect a 2900 acre Chesapeake Bay salt marsh island.  Shallow bays, mares and low vegetation are plentiful.  Most of the waterways are protected from wind and current so all levels are able to access this state park.  There are kayaks and canoes to rent if you do not have your own.",
