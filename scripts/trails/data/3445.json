    "description": "Very well marked and traveled trail with excellent views. Best in summer and fall when the river crossing is easy. Water goes underground for this period.",
    "directions": "Start at Forgetmenot Pond parking lot and head west on the road. Once you reach the bridge on the left cross over and follow trail markers.  Once you cross the river bed and start back into the woods there is a trail cairn on the right almost right away. This is the start of the upward trail.  Enjoy. Forgetmenot Pond Parking area is 26.6km past the second, more westerly entrance to Bragg Creek from hiway 66.",
