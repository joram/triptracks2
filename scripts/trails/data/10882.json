    "description": "A nice walk close to home with a waterfall, river and lake to enjoy.At first the trail goes down a hill and you can see Nichols Lake off in the distance.The trail then levels out and the woods are more open.Go to the right when the trail splits.After walking  through dense woods awhile you hear the sound of the waterfall.Just downstream from the falls is a log bridge that you can cross over to get upstream to the stillwater or downstream to the lake both 5 min walk.As it was icy we decided not to cross the bridge this time.Following the river downstream from the bridge you come to Nichols lake with a view to the west and the river sounds behind you. A very peacefull spot to go swimming or fishing in the summer.",
    "directions": "Prospect road to hatchett lake then to the right of lake is a graveyard.Trailhead on the right on top of hill in parking lot.",
