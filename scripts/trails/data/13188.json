    "description": "This is one of those easy falls to check out when you don?t have time to hike a long distance.  From the road, the brook is pretty unassuming.  Follow it to the crest of the North Mountain.  The first plunge is a nice 20ft fall and then the rest is a series of never ending cascades as the brook is loosing about 100m in height in a short distance.",
