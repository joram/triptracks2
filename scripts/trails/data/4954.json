    "description": "The thing that blows me away everytime I paddle this area is the amount of wildlife.  You can spend many more hours on other bodies of water and not see all the birds and fish and turtles and mammals that call this area home.  It might be the lack of a human population.  There is only a handful of homes and they are all packed in down by the launch.  It may be the abundance of food as the rest of the pond is surrounded by farms and woods.  Whatever it is, this is a great place to bring a camera and also a great place to get a solid workout as I guarantee you won't be sharing the water with too many other people.  The only downside is the very steep launch.  Please be careful.",
    "directions": "If you are on Rt. 32 in Mansfield turn West onto 275 and the parking area is 0.3 miles on your right.  If you are in Coventry on Rt. 31, turn East onto 275 and the parking area will be on your left in about 1.5 miles",
