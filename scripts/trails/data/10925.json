    "description": "My second favourite (moderate) hike after Calico Tanks, it's in the Red Rock Canyon (scenic drive - 1 way) well past half way.  You initially descend, then, begin a moderate ascent on easy to moderate trail, until the canyon starts to close in on you.  At that point, the canyon hike gets more technical, you'll see climbers on either side on the sheer cliffs if you look closely.  Rocky in places, it's called Icebox because it's cooler in the narrow parts of the Canyon where not much sunlight gets in.We turned around as the boulders got more severe and the ups and downs a bit trickier, mostly running out of time, we had sampled a fair bit as the GPS data shows.",
    "directions": "Park at the trail head (parking lot) about 2/3 of the way around the Scenic Drive in the Red Rock Canyon Park -- it's off Blue Diamond Parkway, near Las Vegas (Summerlin area). Pay the day fee and grab a trail flyer at the visitor centre.  If staying in Las Vegas, this is a great trail to do in addition to Calico tanks.",
