    "description": "Fairly easy round the park with a bit of climb at the start. Can be done in either direction or from the Red Gate.",
    "directions": "I have found the best way to approach this side of the Park is from the water towers at the top of Cunliffe Road (going South). Drive up to the top of Cunliffe and park. Walk up & past the two water towers and continue up until you get to the old road. You can either go right and hike downwards to the trail head of Parabola Trail or just cross the road and continue up until you hit the trail. You will see a bench at the junction. Turn left on Parabola and hike up until you come to the junction of Parabola and The Wall. This is a fairly constant climb. Turn right on The Wall. This takes you to the top of the cliffs and an amazing view of the valley. Continue right (West) until you come to The Lookout trail. The Lookout trail goes right and if you go left, it takes you out to Rattlesnake Point. Follow the Lookout trail until you come to the old road. At that junction, you will see cars parked below at the Red Gate. You can also do the hike from this gate but, the parking lot usually is fair full. Turn right at the junction and continue back to the water towers and your car. The route from The Wall & Lookout trail back down is the longest so if you want to spend more time at the top and have a shorter, downhill return, I would suggest doing this in the reverse of what I have described.",
