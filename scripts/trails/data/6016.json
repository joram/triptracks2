    "description": "Multiple loops of grassy Dual track with some single-track.  Moderately rooted.  A few hills on some loops.  Quiet area with interpretive signs and maps.  \nA very nice area to XC ski close to town.  The trails are very professionally groomed by the local Nordic ski club.\nProbably only 10km or so of trails, but it abuts the Sturgeon River and other St. Albert trails so you can probably add to it.",
    "directions": "NE corner from Sir Winston Churchhill Ave and Poundmaker Rd on the NE boundary of St. Albert near Sturgeon golf course.",
