    "description": "NTS Map:92K3. The Canyon View Trail is a 6 km loop along the Campbell River.  You get to cross the Canyon on an 80 foot walkway.  Other highlights include nice trees, whitewater rapids and in the fall spawning salmon.  This is an easy loop on a well marked trail.  Total time is just over an hour.",
    "directions": "The trailhead is at the John Hart Generating Station off Highway 28.  Once you get into the parking lot, look for the signs pointing you in the right direction.  To get there head towards Gold River and about 10 minutes out of Campbell River you will see a sign on right for the generating station.",
