    "description": "NTS Map:92F1.  This park was dedicated in 1957 and became a favorite swimming and picnicing spot. The City of Nanaimo built a trail that goes around the lake hugging the shoreline and actually extending out over the lake using a beautiful boardwalk. The trail is rated for bikes but there are a series of gates you will have to lift your bike over. \r\n\r\nThere is a Off-Leash area on the backside of the lake that is seperate from the regular trail.\r\n\r\nYou could extend your hike to the popular Westwood Ridge trails, but that will add 4-5 hours to this easy walk. \r\n\r\nWatch for the bike bypass that takes you away from the lake for a bit and the short-cut at the North-West end of the lake.",
    "directions": "Take Jingle-Pot Rd to Westwood Lake Rd. Follow the signs to the parking area. Free parking for now.",
