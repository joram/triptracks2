    "description": "This is a family interpretive trail just under 1 km, in fact we encountered a family with young children doing the loop which includes a lookout over Smoke Lake.  It's an easy stretch point for those traversing Algonquin parks' HWY 60 on the way through.\r\rSadly, or perhaps because it's well used, it's been gravelled over, it's not a trail experience, but it does have some steep slopes to make it slightly interesting.  \r\rAlmost all trail estimate times published by Ontario parks are about double the time it actually takes -- at least we found we did any of the HWY 60 hikes in about half the published completion time.\r\r",
    "directions": "At 13.8 km marker in the park, there is also a sign on the side of the road (left if approaching from the Western).  13.8 km is the highway marker from the western gate.",
