    "description": "Los Penasquitos Canyon Preserve: The creek provides a relaxing riparian backdrop for this popular loop trail. I'd call it more of a valley han a canyon. It's a popular 3720 acre oasis of a nature preserve amid the traffic of Southern California. It's home to birds (we heard many and saw few), cougars and coyotes. The scenery varies from forest to open grass areas. Most of the trail is open to the sun, with not much shade.\nYou can choose the distance of your loop depending on where you cross the creek. There is a small waterfall along the creek.\nMAPS: www.sandiego.gov/park-and-recreation/parks/penasq.html",
