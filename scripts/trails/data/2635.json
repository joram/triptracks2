    "description": "Elevation Gain: ~ 850 m (2,800 ft). Distance: 22km. Max. el: ~2360 m (7750 ft).\r\n\r\nAngel Wing is a minor peak directly above Grinell Glacier that provides airplane type views of the glacier and valley below.\r\nFollow the trail to Grinell Glacier (see trail description elsewhere on trailpeak). From the glacier, continue past the glacier towards the saddle between Mt. Gould and Angel Wing.  The most difficult part of the route is not the scrambling up Angel Wing (class II), rather it is finding a place to cross the glacial stream between the glacier and the waterfals. We found a spot where the stream flowed under a solid chunk of ice and took a chance at crossing it, rather than freezing our feet at a stream crossing. It worked out but it felt a bit iffy to do so!",
