    "description": "This scenic trail passes through one of the most famous slot canyons on the Lower Colorado. It ends at a scenic cove on the lake beside Balance Rock, a huge rock mass precariously balanced atop a narrow column of stone. Bighorn sheep are often present.  The Crack in the Mountain Trail, known by locals as \"SARA's Crack,\" primarily follows a natural wash down to Lake Havasu, but the blue and green trails were established by Tim O'Connor in 1986. Balance Rock has been climbed by members of the Leaping Lizards Tribe. http://www.golakehavasu.com/activities/hiking/trails/crack-in-the-mountain/For guided hiking options and multi-day treks  in the area check out Arizona Outback Adventures.",
    "directions": "Drive south on Hwy 95 to McCulloch Blvd (mile post 177). Turn right and travel \u00be mile to the parking lot in SARA Park on the right (elev 860 ft).",
