    "description": "Top of the Palm Springs Tram, there are in fact a number of hiking trails. It's way cooler up there than down in the desert valley by a about 40 degrees F at any time of the year.This trail provides a view of the desert below as the name indicates.The tram itself is most interesting in that the floor rotates as you ride up or down. It doesn't matter where you stand you will get a 360 degree view on both the way up and down. (The marvels of Swiss engineering).There is a cost to getting up to this state park.  tram track isn't quite correct as in it definitely doesn't take the jog indicated but it more than gives the right idea of the trail and gets you on and off correctly.",
    "directions": "North Palm Canyon Drive in Palm Springs take the road to the tram.",
