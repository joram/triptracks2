    "description": "7 km that seem like up hill all the way.lol.Realy is a great hike with alot of up hill.First stop is at 1.5 km at a place we call Egg Rock.Great view of the river and the trail yet to come.Upwards to a nice view of Egg Rock and Kitimat off in the distance.Good picture area.Upwards somemore to the second stop at about 2.2 km on the left is a septacular view down into a 250 foot canyon.Downward to the shallow river is a small waterfall and the end of the trail.Cross the river and there is a small picnic area for a well deserved weiner roast.",
    "directions": "From Kitimat towards Terrace at the Info Center turn RIGHT onto Forest Ave for about 1.5 km until you come to a Y in the road stay LEFT ontil you come to Old Hirsh CREEK bridge.Park your vehicale about 100 m before the bridge.There will be a old logging road off to the right follow it to the end about 500 m over a big log and the trail head is at the end on a big up hill.",
