    "description": "Fun trail lots of ladders and steep in spots. it comes out to the Coquitlam river. Only ride in dry conditions !!!",
    "directions": "Start up the main logging road on Burke. Take the first left. After a few minutes, this road forks again, stay left . trail is on the left side before the power lines.\nEd:  Hmmm.. how about we say you drive North up Coast Meridian Road from #7 about 5.0km.  After Highland Drive turn right on Harper and follow the switchbacks up, keeping left at the Y's at 2.9km and 4.9km.  The trailhead is about ~5.8 km up Harper Road from Coast Meridian Road.",
