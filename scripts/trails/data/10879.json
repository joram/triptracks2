    "description": "This trail can either start at the West Canyon Trail Parking lot or on the road up Mike lake about 100 meters of the main road.  This trail use to be a rail spur for logging about 80 years ago so the grade on the most part is even.  8.7 km one way with a high alt of 1100.  Some artifacts along the trail include a train wheel and some rail and of course cables.  Your far enough of the main road to no hear any traffic going into the park.  Very nice overall leisure trail.",
