    "description": "Great hike with great views from the top.",
    "directions": "Take exit 238 off the Coquihalla and get onto the Juilliet Creek Forest service road.  The road is very overgrown in places so be prepared to scratch up your car.  A group of seven of us traveled there in a two wheel drive Toyota Previa Van which made it to within 1.8 kilometres from the trail head which is clearly marked.  There are some deep washouts in the road so a high clearance 4W drive is recommended. The beginning of the trail was covered with cut down branches that were easy to trip on.  There are a few trail markers here and there but when approaching Drum Lake the trail is more difficult to find.  Need to hike up some loose scree before getting to the wide ride that leads to the summit.  Beautiful views from the top.  I was there on August 23 when the wild flowers were abundant just above Drum Lake.  We didn't have to cross any snow patches and there were few bugs (only a few mosquitoes).",
