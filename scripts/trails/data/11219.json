    "description": "This route follows a road and is one of those hikes that is best experienced in the fall when the leaves are changing colour or for snow shoeing. It is also a good road for a beginner as there aren?t any real steep hills. There is a shooting range further down Goose Lake Road that may be disconcerting to some people. There seems to be a good deer population though.",
    "directions": "Turn onto Copperhead and go past Versitile then turn right on Lac le Jeune Road. Travel South on Lac le Jeune Road and turn left on Goose Lake Road. Continue on Goose Lake road for about 200m and park just before the cattle guard on your right. This route is an out & back and follows an established road to the end. There are two junctions on the way, stay to the right. At the end, there is a clearing that is used for target practice by the looks of it. If you continue on there is an established trail and I followed it for a bit and it seemed to be heading for the top of the hill. I was with a group and wasn?t able to follow it further, but is on my list to check out. On the way back, I dead headed on a game trail to cut out a loop in the road and it was easy to find the road. There are other trails that a person could check out.",
