    "description": "I am always looking for unusual geological features and I found one by hiking to the tip of Clark's Head.  The hike starts on a sloped beach and soon some cliffs begin on one side.  As soon as you round off the first point you can clearly see the two islands (aka the brothers).  There is some gypsum cliffs and a small sea stack coming up.  Around the next point is a huge square looking natural arch...it's really spectacular!  After the natural arch and if you hike another 1km in a western direction there is another huge sea stack with some trees on top.",
    "directions": "In Parrsboro, take the two islands road and turn right on Old Farm Rd and then left on Cove Rd.  Park at a brook and follow it down to the beach.",
