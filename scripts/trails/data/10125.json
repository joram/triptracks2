    "description": "Built in 2010 by the Bow Valley Mountain Bike Alliance and Parks.\nLuke, this is a technical freeride trail with jumps, features and a very well built curved wall to test the concepts of centripetal force on.  Black rated and I'm sure Parks Canada people have nightmares about it but BVMBA musta put a ton 'o work into this, it's really well done.  Thanks BVMBA!  Do Star Wars counter-clockwise to get the most of the technical features.\nOnly about 120m of total drop (and total climbing up the NE side but very nicely gradual), they've done great things with this trail, you'd swear you dropped double or triple that.  No way to shuttle it though.\nThis and 6 other trails (Hoodoos, Tunnel Mountain Loop Singletrack, Star Wars, The Toe, Snake and Water Tower) form a buncha new mountain bike trails within Banff Park.  In the past, there were *very* limited options for riding in the woods of National Parks.  But thanks to a philosophy change by Parks Canada and some *VERY* hardworking volunteers at the Bow Valley Mountain Bike Alliance (BVMBA), we now have these to enjoy.  And you WILL enjoy them, they're good!.  And even better, there are more coming, the BVMBA tells me late spring 2012 should have another new, technical trail open near Star Wars.  Support you local MBA, BVs trail building night is Wednesdays, bring boots & gloves, they have a Pulaski with your name on it.",
