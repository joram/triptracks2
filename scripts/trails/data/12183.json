    "description": "This is a new to me and probably to most people fall.   You can actually spot this one on google earth!  I had followed this brook a few years back and turned around too quickly when I ended up at a small cascade.  However if I had persisted, I would have come up to an unexpected 20ft fall.   Full disclosure;  a fellow explorer (Andrew H), pointed out this fall to me as we are searching the hills near New Anann for a McNutt fall which still remains unlocated as of January 2016!The walk is on a dirt road which is a snowmobile path in the winter.  you then veer off on an old path, pass a an old cabin and follow a really small stream through a hardwood forest all the way to the Middle Branch north river.  then a few hundred metres down, you cross an ATV path.  the falls are located just downstream of that path.",
    "directions": "Highway 311.  turn on old Nutby Rd.  I parked at the Y intersection where the road goes up to the turbines.   The falls are approx at N45.54682 W63.23645",
