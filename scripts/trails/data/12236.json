    "description": "Thos was an exploratory hike to a tributary which I thought could have an hidden gem; a waterfall.  The hike is through some mixed forest at first but close to the stream it becomes a beautiful Acadian type deciduous forest.   The stream does lose a lot of elevation but it never leads to a large fall.  the biggest ones would be maybe 6 ft but they are continuous.",
    "directions": "Take the old Ecomy Rd up the cobequid and park at approx N45 27 23.1 W63 49 52.6.  Head into the woods due west and find the stream at N45 27 22.4 W63 50 08.1",
