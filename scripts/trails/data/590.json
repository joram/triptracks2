    "description": "NTS Map:92C13.  The first 2.5 km is a loop where you see the Broken Islands, the Amphitrite Lighthouse, the rugged coastline and Terrace Beach. If you are there in storm season, watch in awe as the waves form, grow and crash hard against the rocky shore.\nAfter 2.5 km the trail follows the road until the 4.5 km point. There, the trail continues along the coast for 4 more kilometres.\nConstruction of Phases 3 and 4 of the Wild Pacific Trail has been completed from Big Beach Park to the bike path just outside of Ucluelet. This new section is a fabulous addition to the first section and a great benefit to the local community. Special thanks to the Community Economic Adjustment Initiative grant program, Weyerhaeuser and everyone who has worked so hard to see this project succeed. \nThe trail originated through the vision of Ucluelet's 'Oyster Jim' Martin, and developed by funds donated to the Wild Pacific Trail Society, the trail will eventually continue northwest 14 km along the outer coast to reach the Long Beach section of Pacific Rim National Park. Many volunteers and sponsors have given their time and energy into making this trail nothing short of a National Treasure.",
