    "description": "This hike can be done all four seasons. However, when snowshoeing, we do some short cuts as per the GPS file. Very nice snowshoe hike rewarded with views of Mt Indefatigable at the end. You will encounter back country skiers.",
    "directions": "You can drive on Spray Lakes trail coming from Calgary of Canmore. If you come from Calgary on Hwy 40 take the exit to Peter Lougheed Park and turn on to Smith-Dorrien or Spray Lakes trail. Park at the gate to the Lower Kananaskis Lake recreation area (gate is closed in the winter).",
