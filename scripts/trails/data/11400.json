    "description": "This hike offers fantastic panoramic views of the Cape George region.  I hiked this route in the August time frame but I would image that it would a fantastic winter snow shoe trail as well.3/4 of the trail is done on a hiking trail, however the remaining 1/4 is done along route 337.  Although the return back to the trail head is along the established roadway it provides for the steepest trek of the entire journey and well worth the quad burn :)",
    "directions": "Trail head can be found about 1/4 Km prior to the Lighthouse as there as a parking lot that can accommodate a few dozen cars.  The attached gps file starts precisely where the parking lot can be found.",
