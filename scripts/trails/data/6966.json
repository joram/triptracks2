    "description": "Bike and hike from Sooke Rd., through wilderness West to the highest mountain in the region.  \nI recommend biking the first 10km.  The trail is perfect for biking, smooth and constant grade, although difficult, gaining about 350m.  The biking section ends at the gate to the watershed.  \nPark the bike and take the old track to the South up the hill.  Take the first small track to the left at 48N28.174 123W38.25.  Take the next track to the right at 48N27.983 123W38.261.  The track will peter out in 100 m, so you have to continue on bush whacking 400m up the hill to an very old track starting at 48N27.947 123W38.584 (see picture).    \nThe track leads to another that goes by Crab Apple lake bordered with lilies.  Just before the lake you will pass by a 9' diameter Douglas Fir tree; it stands will above the surround forest.   The trail continues around the lake and then up the hill.  Lots of dead wood to go around on this section.  Keep going up until you see a small marked cairn at the highest point on the track.  The trail to the peak continues to the right to the top of Empress Mt.  From the top you can see Victoria Harbour, Sooke Harbour and Sooke Lake - a full 360 degree view.  It is the highest mountain in Sooke hills at 670m.  \n Elevation gain is 538m.",
    "directions": "The trail head is at N48deg24.996 W123deg35.041.  It is on Sooke Rd just before it reduces from 4 lanes to 2 lanes.  Specifically, it is at the 2nd right lane merging sign.",
