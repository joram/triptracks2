    "description": "This is a hike to get to the base of Indian Brook Falls on Indian Brook near Tarbotvale, Cape Breton Island.  Start walking on the unofficial trail on the north side of the river by the bridge.  After about 1.3km the path starts to descend towards the river.  When you emerge by the side of the river, you can actually see a secondary waterfall across the river on Eel Brook.  Continue on the side of the river another 600m or so.  If water is low your lucky?.or if the water is warm (summer) you are also lucky?just 100m or so before the main fall, the walls are really hard to scramble and you will need to get wet to continue.  My path is back on the slopes and I came down a pretty impossible steep slope to the base of the waterfall but I don?t suggest this to anybody except if you do a lot of climbing?The river route is the better option?you could also bring waders or a small dingy!   The Great Fall are not the tallest you will see in CB but its remote location and sheer rocks walls all around make this a special place.",
