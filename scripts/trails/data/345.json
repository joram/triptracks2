    "description": "NTS Map: 082N08Lake Louise is a very pretty lake framed by some picture postcard Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\nIt isn't a wilderness moment unless you go in the off-season.  However, it is very easy to rent a canoe for a few hours and paddle through the emerald green waters towards the mountains and glacier.\r\n\r\nNot a bad option for those looking for a way to marvel at the mountains while moving -- being on the water is always fun. Never mind that you might bump into another canoe if you look away for too long. Perhaps a nice alternative while visiting Banff.  \r\n\r\nThe point is -- you can rent canoes on this lake, and it's pretty hassle free.\r\nTo get there, follow the signs out of Banff town center to Lake Louise, and park in one of the upper public parking lots.  Don't forget to feed the meter.  As you make your way to the Lake using one of the short trails, you won't be able to miss the canoe rental dock, and you certainly can't miss the steady stream of canoes heading off on their tour.",
