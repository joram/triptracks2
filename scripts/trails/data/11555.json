    "description": "Near this cave is the town of Havelock where once NB's longest cave was located....well it's probably still there but it's located on Lafarge's property is so it's off limits.    There is a small cave located close by.  You either traverse an old field covered by pricly bushes or try to stay in the tress where you might spot a faint trail leading you to the cave.  the entrance of the cave is about 3ft high and seems to go in a further if you are willing to do a wet crawl.....which I wasn't prepared/willing to do!",
    "directions": "In Havelock, take the 885 north and then turn left on springhill Rd.  Park approximately 200m passed the Cross Rd intersection and head down into the field on your right (North)",
