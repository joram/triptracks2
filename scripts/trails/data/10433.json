    "description": "I found this trail system the other day while checking out a geo-cache further down the road.\nThe \"trail head\" if you can call it that is at N44 21.736, W064 14.009 it is a parking spot on the side of the road. It is a mix of trail and deer runs. The trails in the area seem endless. \nThe trails run around on some barren rocks with shrubs. There are great views everywhere. A great spot to explore for an hour or so. \nYou may want a GPS if you have a very poor sense of direction as the trails are very hard to follow but the area is very open, and you are never too far from the road. I ended up having to cut through a half frozen marsh to complete my return to the car.\nthought others may enjoy the spot\ncheers",
