    "description": "This trip, along the Monarch Ramparts and out via Healy Pass, can be viewed as an extension to our previously posted trip around Eohippus Lake from Sunshine (great for those who like more distance and more elevation).Magnificent views of Monarch Mountain as you pass several lakes and then ascend to the south end of the Ramparts above Eohippus Lake.While travelling across the Ramparts, remember that this is a huge corniced ridge during winter. The exit down from Healy Pass is always busy, but still worthwhile.24 Km, but mostly down hill!",
    "directions": "We started at Sunshine Ski Village (just west of Banff) and ended at the base parking lot.",
