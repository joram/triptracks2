    "description": "Elevation gain: 1036 m (3,395 ft). {Ed:  I think this number reflects the entire trip up to the forestry lookout, 358m (1180') would be a more typical total elevation gain for the return trip to the Whiskey Jack junction.}This trail is one of many in the Peter Lougheed Provincial Park (in the Kananaskis Country south of Canmore, AB.)  The trail begins at the Pocaterra Hut parking lot and climbs 950 ft while meandering through alpine meadows and forested areas.  It connects to either Whiskey Jack trail (the easy way out) or to the Lookout trail, a straight climb to the ranger station/lookout.  From here, there is a dramatic back-country escape that is pure adrenalin.NTS Map: 082j11",
    "directions": "Take highway 40 (Kananaskis Trail) south from the Trans-Canada Highway (the turn-off is about 20 minutes east of Canmore).  Go 49.5km S to Peter Lougheed Park access (at winter closure gate), turn west, first left is Pocaterra Lot.",
