    "description": "Pretty much right in the SW Corner of Utah, this is a series of snaking trails through juniper and pine, which then runs along slickrock bowls and ledges. \nThe trails are marked by dots so you don't get lost on the slickrock. When you are off the slickrock, the trail is fairly obvious. \nWe camped on the Mesa and rode from our campsite.",
    "directions": "As you pass through Hurricane heading east on Highway 9, turn right at the Highway 59 sign. One block later, turn left and drive out of town. About 15 minutes later, you'll pass a gas station on the left-hand side, and then some fields. Watch for a \"Scenic Byway\" sign, and turn left onto a dirt road (14.8 miles from the turnoff in Hurricane). Two miles later, just as you reach the mountain, the Gooseberry Mesa road turns off on your left. Another 3.6 miles after the turnoff, take the left fork. Now stay on the bigger road, ignoring any forks. 1.1 miles later, you'll cross a cattle guard. Park there. The South Rim trail begins along the fence on the left side of the road. Trailhead GPS: N 37? 08.491'  W 113? 10.299'",
