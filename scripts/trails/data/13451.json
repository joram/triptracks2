    "description": "Ok as the name suggests, this is not a hike to a waterfall but rather some cascades.  Why did I bother?  Well I saw the names; Sorrow and Island Falls on some topo maps and I was in the vicinity and you all know about my addiction to waterfalls.\n\nthe road leading towards the fall seem well travelled by ATV and perhaps truck but we hiked it.  To see Sorrow fall turn on a secondary path at; N43\u00b0 35' 37.6\" W65\u00b0 34' 45.1\".  It leads to a cabin and the river and Sorrow Falls.  To reach Island falls, follow a faint ATV trail into a barren at N43\u00b0 35' 24.2\" W65\u00b0 34' 57.0\" and then bushwack to the river\n\nI would not go out of my way to see those for the falls but it must make a fun ride in spring in a canoe or kayak",
    "directions": "Highway 103 goes over a dirt road than you need to follow towards Barrington Lake.  The road is sometimes named as Scotts Mill Rd.  Park on the side of the 103 and walk that road.",
