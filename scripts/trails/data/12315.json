    "description": "A great little loop around a beautiful and often overlooked lake with good swimming in the summer. Start at the Hartland Landfill Parking lot (It is outside of the dump and created for the mountain bikers who ride mount work. There is a fire road in and out of the woods to get to an off-shoot that takes you around towards the lake.  The lake itself is quite beautiful and you are often likely to see anywhere from a couple to a dozen eagles hanging around just before dusk.  The trail around the lake on the North and West is well paved and there is a shorter route that can be accessed from the south east but this route is more beautiful, varied and has some actual elevation gain which is nice.",
    "directions": "Park as directed in the description and then head across the road to the main trail access. Walk along the fire road until you see a cement marker on the left for a trail called shock treatment. Then continue and enter the next trail on the left.  This trail zig-zags and offers a couple of initial options to head left to the lake. Stay to the right to make a counter-clockwise loop for the best walk.",
