    "description": "Part of the Appalachian Trail Baldpate mountain gives you two summits (one over tree line) in a short distance. The trailhead starts at the parking lot in the Grafton Notch State Park. Tons of snow surrounded us during the hike until we got to West Baldpate. The wind turned the snow to ice and the snowshoes were basically useless, only people who brought crampons were able to summit West Baldpate. Altitude gain of 650m on 13.5kms round trip.\nWord of caution: The trail although well marked, deviates from marked trail on topo maps.\nIf you have a second day on hand try Old Speck Mountain, literally across the street from Baldpate. We didn't complete this hike because of lack o time and the great view that made us appreciate the sun just a little to long. We complete 6kms and 420m gain. The total run would probably be more like 12 kms.",
    "directions": "From the town of Newry Maine follow hwy 26 to Grafton Notch State park the trailhead is more towards \nthe northern part of the park, a big parking lot is available (free).",
