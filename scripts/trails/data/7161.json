    "description": "This is an additional part of the Cape George Trail system. See Cape George Trail in TrailPeak for an excellent description of trail. This section starts at the Cape George Lighthouse. The 4km return  trail offers panoramic views of the lighthouse, Ballantynes Cove and Gulf of St Lawrence.  The plotted gps ends, as I reversed my tracks, but the trail loops down and joins the Cape George Trail listed in TrailPeak.",
    "directions": "Following the Sunrise Trail, along route 337, in Cape George. Look for for the road to Cape George Lighthouse. park in the picnic park and walk back to Hwy 337 where the trail crosses over the road.",
