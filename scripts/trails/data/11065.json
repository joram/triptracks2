    "description": "A short accessible trail in Cape Breton Highlands National Park is the perfect example of what the terrain on top of the Highlands looks like; boggy!A lot of people bypass this trail for the more exciting trails such as Skyline or Fishing Cove but this one offers a lot for such a short trail.  First of all, at about 500m,  it?s short so it?s perfect for anybody on the trip.  It?s also on a raised boardwalk the whole way around so even in the pouring rain; your feet will be relatively dry.  It?s also got a lot of information signage for the plants and animals of the bog which you probably don?t know very much about in the first place.  The bog area is interspersed with tamarack trees and Labrador tea shrubs.  Look for the insectivore plant called Pitcher plant..it?s everywhere and it?s sure to please the kids!",
