    "description": "The trail winds along mountainous terrain, affording some spectacular views. \nAltitude varies from 100 to 450 m. The forested landscape is varied. It is composed of maple, pine and fir groves, where individual trees of majestic proportions can be found in mature stands. Numerous lakes, ponds, streams and cascades add variety to the landscape and provide a chance to cool off. \nWildlife is more easily observed in this area, undisturbed by other human activity.  There are few facilities along the trail. Nine primitive campsites 7 to 9 km apart are provided.",
    "directions": "The trail is in La Mauricie National Park.  The Park  is located in the centre of Quebec, north of Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, halfway between Qu\u00e9bec and Montr\u00e9al.",
