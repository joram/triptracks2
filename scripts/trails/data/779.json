    "description": "NTS Map:92B11.  Gowland Todd Provincial Park is on the east side of Findlayson Arm and is accessed from Wallace Rd. The vegetation starts off as spruce and cedar forest, and then as the climb progresses the trees thin out and give way to arbutus forest (eaves on the ground are slippery at all times). We gathered at the Mount Work parking lot and followed what can best be described as a goat track along the shore of the inlet through some pretty thick vegetation, and then began our ascent of the mountain. We finally reached the peak of the mountain to a spectacular view of the inlet and Sidney in the distance. Please note this is very steep terrain",
