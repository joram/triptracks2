    "description": "Easy and rewarding hike with views down both ends of Okanagan Lake and both Jade I Juniper Bays. There are benches along the path to allow you to enjoy the scenery.",
    "directions": "Take Kidston Road to Jade & Juniper parking lots. Go right to the back parking area (paid parking, $1 per hour or $3 per day). Right where the parking meter is located, is the trail head. When you get to the first fork, go left and then further up the trail, stay to the right. This takes you along the cliffs and is a bit of a roller coaster but, gives you an excellent view of Pet Beach & Cosens Bay. Follow this trail until it joins with the main trail to Rattlesnake Point. Once you are heading back from the Point, stay to the left which goes along the lake and takes you to Jade & Juniper Bays. When you leave the Bays, take the paved path back to your vehicle.",
