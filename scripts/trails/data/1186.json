    "description": "A short trail leading to a viewpoint with views of the peaks of Mt Revelstoke, the lake behind the Revelstoke Dam and the surrounding mountains - the drive up to Balsam Lake also provides many great opportunities to see the surrounding countryside - the area around Eagle Knoll and Balsam Lake is a wildflower show par excellance in late July and early August.\rThere are several other trails that can be explored from the Balsam Lake area - there is a warming hut at the parking area and a shuttle bus to take up closer to the peak.",
    "directions": "Take the Meadows in the Sky - Mt Revelstoke National Park cutoff from the Trans-Canada Highway just after you leave the town of Revelstoke heading east towards rogers pass and follow it to the summit parking area at Balsam Lake.A seasonal shuttle bus will take you further up the alpine but I was too early in the day to be able to use it.\r\rRemember you need a national park permit to use this road and the gate was named in late July 2004.",
