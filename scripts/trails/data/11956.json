    "description": "A very nice ride through Wildhorse Canyon. The first 2 kms are a pretty challenging climb, followed by a relatively flat path through meadows and the canyon. We terminated at a bluff high up from the lake. Its a steep path down to the beach.",
    "directions": "Drive to the south end of Lakeshore Road. The trail begins on the other side of the street from the last house at the very south end of the road.",
