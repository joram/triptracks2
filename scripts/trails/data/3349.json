    "description": "Beautiful paddle through fast running water with no rapids. Two ways of doing this, the easy way (with two cars), or the lonely way \r\n(one car) which makes you appreciate having a loved one with a second car. In July current runs at close to 4 knots. \r\n\r\nThe easy way takes you from Labelle downstream to Breboeuf with running water throughout the course. Can do the track in one day.\r\n\r\nThe hard way takes you up-current. Not difficult but will give you good workout.\r\n\r\nMany places to stop for lunch on riverside, couple of campgrounds (commercial) can be \r\nfound. Fishing is abundant.\r\n\r\nThis trail starts at:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r",
    "directions": "From St Jovite take HWY 117 to Labelle put-in from bellow the Chute aux Iroquois, follow the river down. On a good long day you can easily \r\ngo down this river. Take out at Breboeuf, where the will keep your car for $5.",
