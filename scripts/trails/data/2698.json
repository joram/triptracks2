    "description": "NTS Map: 082J15Tom Snow is a K-co Classic.  a great ride with lots of variety.  Only 180m from the lowest to highest point BUT add 'em up.  It involves 1134m of climbing (and interestingly only 1125m of descending, hmmm, well GPS isn't perfect.)From Station Flats, cycle 1.4km to the Allen Bill Pond parking area, take the trail starting at the NE end of parking lot and go under the hiway.  Don't take the first turn to the right, but go about 810m from the bridge, just past the map/sign then turn right.  There are several ways to make a loop out of this.  You can go straight into the West Bragg parking area (and make a dash into town for lunch) or bypass it a bit and get around to Tom Snow that-away.  The enclosed track log shows an alternate way to get there.  A way that includes humping your bikes through a slough.  A wet slough.  You've been warned.Tom Snow seems to be a road but not a very used one.  Follow the road until you pass Ranger Creek and take a left at a marked (with a map) trail junction.  Follow this right back to Station Flats.There are more maps along this area of 'wilderness' then I've even seen in one forest in my life.  You'll feel safe doing it.  It shares many trails with the Bragg Creek XCSki club.This trail is right beside:",
