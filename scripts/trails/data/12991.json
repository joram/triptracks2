    "description": "Really two different trails but you access both from the same location.  Both begin in Little Port.  Cedar Cove is an easy 1.8 km hike, while the Little Port Head Lighthouse is a moderate to difficult 3 km hike.  Make sure you take gloves for the Little Port hike as there are ropes in place to assist you in your climb.",
    "directions": "Take Route 450 on the South Shore of the Bay of Islands in Western Newfoundland to Little Port.  You can park across the street from the wharf.  The staircase leading to the trails is located there.",
