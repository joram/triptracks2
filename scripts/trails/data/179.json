    "description": "\r\nThe Mount Seymour Trail is convenient for Vancouver area hikers, but be prepared just the same.\r\n\r\nTo get there, take the 2nd Narrows bridge from Vancouver, and take the 3rd turnoff on the right following \"Mount Seymour Parkway\".  Continue several kilometers until you reach Mount Seymour road (directions are as per going skiing at Seymour).  There is a mall on the left, turn left onto Mount Seymour road and continue to the top. At the Northwest corner of the Parking lot, follow the trail (you'll see a sign and see some printed maps), although we repeat the waypoints here. Keep in mind topo maps for this area are NAD27, and the above points are WGS84 Datum, so, once loaded in as WGS84, either follow the GPS route as is, or convert to NAD27 Canada to match with your topo map.  The trail is well marked, and you'll likely see others, but be prepared for cold weather up top, and, don't forget about the airliner that went down a few mountains back in 1947 that was only found a few years ago.  This is wilderness.\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\nWaypoint #11, Dinky Peak, #12 Ski-hill, #13 back on trail, #14 Turn to Elsay Lake, #15 Peak 1, #16 Peak 2, #17 Peak 3.  We'll write out the waypoints, Datum WGS84, and soon we'll place the track and waypoints in a downloadable G7TOWIN file.\r\n\n\r\nW  010A 10U  503733.6  5468274.8\nW  011 10U  503669.9  5468845.2\nW  012  10U  503956.4  5469313.2\nW  013 10U  504085.1  5469482.0\nW  014 10U  504642.1  5470385.8\nW  015 10U  504269.9  5470512.3\nW  016 10U  504088.5 5470862.9\nW  017  10U  504023.0 5471181.5",
