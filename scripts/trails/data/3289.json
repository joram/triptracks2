    "description": "Tombstome Campground is situated on the Big Elbow Loop hence there are a number of trails that lead to and meet in the area of the campground. \r\rThe shortest access to Tombstone Campground and the picturesque lakes just beyond is starting from the Highwood pass area at the Elbow Lake trail.\r\rThis trail first heads to Elbow Lake then around the lake into the valley to a junction with the Sheep river trail. \r\rAt Sheep river trail junction go left, down the hill across bridge for Tombstone Campground (it's a back country campground). The trail to Tombstone  lake and pass lies just 100 meters beyond the campground. \r\rSlightly further is the junction with Big Elbow Loop. (there is big sign at this point)\r\rThere is also Conservation officers cabin near the campground\r\rThe scenery is fantastic it's a classic mountain hike, lakes, mountains and valleys.\r\rGPS data attached goes to campground then to high point on the Elbow Loop trail",
    "directions": "Highway 40 Elbow Lake trail parking. Follow the trail to Elbow lake. Elbow lake is just 1.5 km from highway so it gets busy. The trail starts off rather steeply immediately on leaving the parking lot.",
