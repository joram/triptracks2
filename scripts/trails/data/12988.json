    "description": "This is a hike to a waterfall located in the middle of an area that is inaccessible by car but has lots of ATV trails.  The way I am describing sometimes uses those ATV trails but most times just bushwack alongside Kings Brook all the way to the Haunted Lake tributary.  The fall is locate on the Haunted lake tributary just a few metres before it meets King Brook.The walk alongside King Brook is moderate at first as there is lots of deadfall and the trees are close together.  Once you reach the still waters it is easier as you can walk in the open along the brook.  At some point you may find an atv track which is going towards the fall.Close to the fall, the ravine of King Brook is steep and the water from the Haunted lake creates a nice 20 ft fall.  However only go after multiple rainfalls as the brook is really small and may not be running.  The fall is at N44 53 23.2 W63 39 02.9...there are many ways to get there so choose the one you like!",
    "directions": "Highway 2. In Wellington, turn on Kings Road and follow it as it becomes Sleepy Cove Rd. Don't drive all the way as it becomes someone's driveway at the end. I parked near N44 53 57.1 W63 37 41.9.",
