    "description": "The trail is well marked and easy to follow. After the first easy part to the first viewpoint over the Squamish valley, it starts to climb very rapidly with very steep sections all the way up to the upper valley. In the upper valley the trail opens up and offers views of Pelion and Ossa mountains. After 8km the trail reaches a log bridge and after that it starts to climb again, steeply, to the base of a big snowfield, under the glacier between Pelion and Ossa, where the camp is.",
    "directions": "Follow the squamish valley road to the Ashlu road bridge, cross it and stay on the main dirt road till you cross a second bridge on the Ashlu creek. Right after the second bridge there is a parking spot and the trail starts in front of it.",
