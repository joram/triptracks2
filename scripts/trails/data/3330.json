    "description": "A fairly easy going 2 km loop in Algonquin Provincial Park.  The trail features an easy ascent to a cliff with several very nice views of the park (not as nice as the more popular Lookout Trail down the road, but still quite nice).  The trail guides at the trailhead discuss the importance of change in Algonquin's forests.  The trail is an easier climb for children than Lookout Trail, although my children aged 5 & 7 managed both easily.",
    "directions": "Parking is located off of Highway 60 in Algonquin Provincial Park at KM 31.",
