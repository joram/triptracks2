    "description": "The trail starts in the trees.  It starts with a gental climb, but quickly becomes fairly steep.  One you hit the tree line, you have to climb some skree.  At the first band of rock cliffs, aim for the right side of the black patch.  Once you have climbed the first band, head left.  There is a gully just to the left of the large black patch on the second band of rock cliffs.  The top of the gully is a bit difficult, but if it is dry, should be too big of a priblem.\nNow you just have to scramble us some more scree to the summit.  Keep generaly to the left.  Don't be too egger to head right toward the summit.\nEditor's note: this trail was previously posted and can be found by clicking   here",
    "directions": "Drive about 10km north of Hwy 3 on the Alison Creek road.  Find parking area on east side of road. You can actualy drive a little but into the forest here to save a bit of walking.",
