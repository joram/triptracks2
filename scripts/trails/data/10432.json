    "description": "This trail is a well known place to bring dogs for an off leash hike. The trails are wide but can be very wet, however there are many alternative routes to get around. There is also many roots and rocks to walk on. At an obvious point of the trail, you come along a beautiful stream which flows rapidly during the springtime. The stream leads down to the lake, where the trail loops back to the beginning. The trail is rated as difficult because of its tendency to be wet, but it is very enjoyable and has beautiful scenery. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do! The trail system is quite extensive, this is just a small portion. New tracks to come.",
