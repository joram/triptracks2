    "description": "The gps track shows the Drill Platform back to the Elk FSR.  This is an old drill site on a closed road from the FSR.  At the drill platform the trail changes to a singletrack and carries on to Connor Lake Cabin and beyond to the Bull River Road at Maiyuk Creek.This hike from the East starts at the Forsythe Creek Rec site off the Elk FSR and follows an abandoned road to the drill site.  There is recent logging across the valley on the way which lowers the enjoyment a bit but it is an excellent hike especially if you carry on to the Lake and Glacier.",
    "directions": "Take Highway 43 to Elkford. Drive north  through the town and continue north on the Elk River FS Road  for 28 km. Turn west at a sign for Connor Lakes and Forsyth Creek for about 2 km to the BC FS Recreation SiteHike across Quarrie Creek from the end of the driveable road. Follow a seismic line west.
