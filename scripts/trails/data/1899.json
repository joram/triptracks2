    "description": "NTS Map: 082J14Elevation gain is 671 m (2,201 ft).This is a lovely trail that gives you a taste of everything a mountain hike has to offer.  The trail starts out in fairly thick forest, on a gentle elevation.  As the trail progresses the slope increases into a fairly long uphill climb to the alpine meadow, passing a nice waterfall on the way.  Once you reach the meadow, it is about a 2km fairly flat hike to the actual pass, in which you'll rise above the tree line.  The pass itself is very steep, but the view the top is well worth the climb.  When all is said and done, you'll have gained over 650m elevation from the parking lot.To to top of the pass is approx. 6.5 kms one way. You can continue from the top of the pass, down the backside to Ribbon Lake, which is another 4km.  This may be tough to complete on a day hike for a beginner, as you'll have to overcome the pass again on the way back.  However, Ribbon Lake is home to a nice back country campground, and this hike offers a nice alternative to the \"chains\" of the  Ribbon Creek trail.The trail from the top of the pass to Ribbon Lake also intersects  Guinn's Pass, which is a difficult 3km hike to  Galatea Creek trail and Lillian Lake.",
    "directions": "Take the Smith-Dorien/Spray trail from either Canmore or Peter Lougheed Provincial Park to Buller Mountain day use area.  Park in the lot to the west of the road, and hike back across the road to the trailhead.",
