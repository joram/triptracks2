    "description": "Short trail down the hill side.  Starts off as a barricaded quad trail and turns into some singletrack through the trees.  May have to hop the fence depending on your line.  Several offshoots to explore.\r\n\r\nInteresting view of the 36m high chimney from the old smelter.  Thas a lotta bricks.\r",
    "directions": "At the South end of Greenwood, turn West on the South side of the PetroCanada, cross the creek and follow the signs to the landfill site.  The trail starts just outside the gates to the landfill off to the right (when looking at the gates).\r\n\r\n\r\nGreenwood is on Hiway 3 (Crowsnest)between Grand Forks & Osoyoos.\r",
