    "description": "In late September the yellow larches along this trail are an awesome sight. But there will be hundreds of other people on the trail, because it's Banff, and in the fall this trail is one of the park's feature attractions.On the day we attempted this hike there was a warning sign at the trailhead stating that a grizzly with 2 cubs had been sighted in the area and hikers were only permitted up the trail in groups of 6 or larger. We only had to wait a few minutes until a group of 4 women from Toronto agreed to hike with us up the trail. Luckily they were also pretty slow. There's a nice meadow at the top of the pass, which permits views of the peaks around you (the Valley of the 10 Peaks). The trail dips back into the larches for a bit then clears the treeline at the base of Sentinel Pass. We met a Parks Canada dude sitting in a lawn chair at this location, admiring the scenery and keeping an eye out for the bears. In the flats before Sentinel Pass there are a couple of pretty reflective pools (called Minestimma Lakes). The switchbacks to Sentinel Pass rise 500 ft above the lakes and look about an hour away, with Mt. Temple rising above. My hiking companion had been dragged practically straight off the plane from Montreal to this spot and was pretty pooped, so we called it even and turned back down to Moraine Lake. All in all a great hike.NTS Map: 082N08Elevation Gain: 732m (2,400 ft), 12km return.",
