    "description": "Centennial Ridge is the highest maintained trail in the Canadian Rockies. Built by the Rocky Mountain Ramblers hiking club from Calgary in 1967, it is the most demanding and impressive day hike in Kananaskis Country. Unusual rock formations and great views all along the long ridge. This trail can be done from Kananaskis village area or from Dead Man's Flats near Canmore. The 16 km distance is from one end or the other (and back). At the sign in the Ribbon Creek parking lot, go north on Hidden Trail. After hiking about 200 meters, turn left and start the long climb to Centennial. Due to various old roads to the Mine Scar, the trail is well marked at its many junctions. After leaving the last of these roads, it's a moderate ascent through aspens to finally reach open slopes. Now it starts getting tough with an ascent of 600 m in less than 2 km (1900' in 1.2 mi). As you make your way up this strenuous section, an imposing rock step leading to the broad Olympic Summit appears in full view. Further along the ridge you encounter the rock garden, a cluster of large conglomerate rocks. As you reach the end of the rock garden, a row of conglomerate rock pinnacles appear on the edge of the ridge. At this point, you begin the arduous final ascent of the summit. As you make your way up, at one of your many rest stops, you can glance back and admire a view of the rock garden from above. About an hour after leaving the rock garden, the summit finally looms close by. Summit views of the surrounding Rockies are impressive; also the town of Canmore. Return the same way unless you wish to take the north route to Dead Man's Flat beside the Trans-Canada highway.Distance of 16km is out and back. Time is around 10 hours.NTS Map: 082J14. Elevation Gain: 1,400 m (4,592 ft).",
