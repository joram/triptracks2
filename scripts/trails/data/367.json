    "description": "This trail is best in the winter when snow covers the narrow and sometimes steep four wheel drive trails. \r\n\r\nStart in Coquitlam past the Westwood Golf Academy (go up Johnson and proceed to the very end) - the road turns into a fairly steep switchback - follow this for a few minutes. Park at the gates (there is a four wheel drive road off on the left.)\r\n\r\nStart up the four wheel drive road - as you go up the trail there are different branches to take - they are marked on trees with names of where they go.  Follow the Noons Creek trail and then the trail that says Viewpoint.  When there is lots of snow (like this year) the trail/road is hard to find.  If nobody has trekked it before the snow can be very deep.\r\n\r\nAllow 3 to 5 hours.",
