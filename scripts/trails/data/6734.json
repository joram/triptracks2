    "description": "This my favorite hike of all time. In just a day hike you can summit a mountain and write your name in a Canadian Rockies summit-cairn register (don't forget your pen!).\nThere are 2 snags that deters many.\n1) There is no trail head and no trail really in the beginning\n2) There is a river to ford fairly early in the hike",
    "directions": "Park on the southeast side of the road in the small gravel pullout 0.9 km southeast from the Crowfoot Glacier Veiwpoint. There should be dark black rocks on a dirt slope on the opposite side of the road.\nFollow the road east-southeast 230 paces there should be a culvert.\nContiune following the road another 140 paces.\nTurn right (south) there may be some flagging, maybe not.\nClimb the roadside boulders and look for foot beaten path.\nFollow the path. At one point the path Y's take the RIGHT path.Your goal is to cross the Bow River right at the mouth of Bow Lake. If you end up at the river further downstream or the lake upstream, you've gone the wrong way. Follow your body of water untill they meet.\nTime to cross the river. I have crossed this twice and the water level varies alot. From just over my boot to mid thigh. Be care the current is strong. Do not cross if the water is too high!\nOn the other side of river the trail is easy to pick up. Follow it for about 2km.\nYou end up on a wet rocky area and the trail can be hard to follow look for flags leading you up the mountain",
