    "description": "This goes back to my other outdoor addiction; looking for caves.  Nova Scotia has pockets of gypsum terrain and when disolved it morphs into karst terrain. Karst terrain is super cool to explore with weird landforms, cave openings, outrageous slopes.  The disolving of the gypsum creates all this ....word of warning there are some caves that form vertically in these parts so be careful when going to the bottom of some of the holes.  Some of the picture attached have some of these old chimney type caves.  I didn't find any human size openings but I didn't cover the whole area either.  Happy exploring.",
