    "description": "NTS Map: 082H04Elevation gain - up and down, no real gain.This is a short, easy trail for the whole family. The trail itself runs from the Akamina Parkway (Cameron Lake road) to the Red Rock Parkway with Crandell Lake about halfway. So it can be done from either end or as a one way with 2 vehicles (or an out and back, it's not that long). The total length from road to road is 4km.\r\nThe terrain is mostly level to moderately steep. At the lake there is a picnic shelter with a wood stove. The lake is not large but is in a very picturesque setting, at the base of Mount Crandell. It is also a popular winter trail for snowshoeing, and even for hiking when the snow's not too deep.\r\nIn winter please check the Avaluator\r\n(Online Trip Planner) rating is: \r\n Simple.  \r\nSee more trip planner route details here.\r\nCurrent conditions:\r\n\r",
    "directions": "Either at the Crandell Lake trailhead on the Akamina Parkway or at the trailhead behind the Canyon Church Camp (use the camp turnoff) off the Redrock Parkway. The camp road is about 1km past the entrance to Crandell Campground.",
