    "description": "NTS Map: 082J15Elevation Gain: 705 m (2315 ft). Distance: 23 km out and back or 25 km loop.Description: Most of the elevation is gained in a hurry at the very beginning for this ridgewalk? but it's pretty easy going after the initial grunt up a steep section.There is not really a well-defined trail up high, but if you continue along the wide, rolling ridge, eventually you reach the site of an old fire lookout. The fire lookout site is a bit anti-climactic but interesting nonetheless (not much remains of the old lookout except some stones that once made up its foundation). Nice view of Nihahi ridge off in the distance to the West. Return back the way you came.",
