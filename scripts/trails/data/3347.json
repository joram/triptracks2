    "description": "Suggest you do this with two cars. This run is part of the Northern Forest Canoe Trail. \r\nFlatwater & moving water throughout this trail. \r\nPut-in at the southern part of Mansonville \r\naccess point is indicated from route 243). Beautiful paddle through farmland and forest. \r\nPlenty of areas to have secluded lunch. Put-out at the bridge in Glen Sutton (17km) or at the Canadian-US border crossing. Be prepared to stop and answer questions at the border, nobody seems to know what paddlers are doing on the river, it's a low key border crossing and they are friendly.",
