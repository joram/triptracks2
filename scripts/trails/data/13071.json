    "description": "Well maintained hike through open forest, and into rolling alpine, with a what appears to be a class 3 approach. My GPS data falls short of the summit by about .7km and 300m of elevation.",
    "directions": "We took the TA 568, a south turn off at sutton pass. We parked our mazda 3 at the TA568D spur and hiked the remain 3km of switch back to the trail head. The well maintained trail was marked at the end of the TA568E line. Two 4x4 trucks were parked there for a day hike, so it is accessible to those with higher clearance.",
