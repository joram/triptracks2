    "description": "There is a second fall on Wier Bk that warrants a visit.  This one is about 15 feet but it is located in a rocky gorge which looks like is used by locals as a swimming spot.  It also looks like that the rocky gorge was dammed off at some point to produce electricity maybe.\r\rHead SW to the back of the fields by the side of the road until you reach the dirt path. Follow this path for just a hundred meters or so until you see some power lines plunging into the ravine on your left.  There is a path that descends into this gorge just pass the power lines which will make it easier to get down to the rivers edge.\r",
    "directions": "Park at  44\u00b0 57.795'N, 63\u00b0 58.381'W and walk in the field in a SW direction between the two houses on highway 1 in Newport Corner.",
