    "description": "NTS Map: 082J14\r\n\r\nMount Shark is a training area with some moderately challenging climbs.  It has a number of loops of different lengths that can be combined and depending on which one(s) you choose, there will be more or less climbs.\r\n\r\nA nice feature is the trails are generally one-way & signed as such, so they have a pretty smooth flow.\r\n\r\nIf you're a biathelete, bring yer guns (call Canmore nordic Center for a range permit first).\r\n\r\nThere are also some ungroomed trails just as you turn off the Smith Dorien Trail onto Mt. Shark road.\r\n\r\nClick Here  for snow and trail grooming conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrent conditions:",
    "directions": "From Banff, drive east to Canmore, then south on Spray Lakes Road.  At 34.7 km past the Canmore Nordic Center turn, turn right (West) up the Mt. Shark Road.  There are parking areas both beside the HeliPad and the main parking lot.\r\nIf coming from the south, it is 27 km north of the junction of Smith Dorrien/Spray Lakes Rd and Kananaskis Lakes Trail (ie Road).\r\n\r\nSpray Lakes Rd. is a gravel road, generally decent conditions but can be unpredictable.  Stay away from the exterme edges, the snowplows plow the snow flat even though the road bed has dropped off and you can get stuck off the side of the road .\r",
