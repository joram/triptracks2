    "description": "Brudenell Island sits off a spit of sand in the Brudenell Resort / provincial park.  It is special because of its nice little trail, but also a spot for a pioneer cemetary. Spend a while looking at the dates and names of people who helped shape the culture of the region you're in.\r\n\r\nHandy to the area is a kayak rental facility. You can launch your own in a spot close by and explore the island's peremeter and surrounding coast-scape.",
    "directions": "From Charlottetown, Head out on TCH Route 1. Take route 3 towards Pool's Corner, and go through the intersection toward Georgetown. Look for signage to Brudenell Provincial Park and the Golf Acadamy. Head toward the water, and enjoy the area.",
