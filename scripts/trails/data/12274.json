    "description": "I was looking for something to do near Yarmouth.  I found a description of High Head and it related to the many soft body animal fossils that can be found on this geological feature.We parked on the dirt road and headed down this dirt road towards the shore.  after a few minutes of walking, we were standing on top of the bluff.  The High Head formation is distinct from all the other formations close by.   The rocks peel off from each other and so going there after a storm is probably best to find new fossils.",
    "directions": "From Highway 1 make your way to the main shore rd.  the bluff is at N43.95776 W66.16345",
