    "description": "Great family hike through a forest fire area.  Forest is growing back but offers great views.  Trail climbs from parking lot for the firs 1.75 km and then rolls along the valley floor to tree line.  A true mountain trail for the last 1.5 km.  Lots of areas to explore and you can even hike up to a very picturesque water fall.  It took us about 2 hours to hike in (with frequent stops for my 5 year old) but both my sons said it was a great hike.  Many water falls cascade down the cliff walls and for adventurous types, you can continue on up the valley to explore the glacier. Great family outing!",
    "directions": "Take Hwy 1 west of Banff to Castle Junction.  Take Hwy 93 south to Radium.  Parking area is just south of the Alberta/BC border on east side of highway.",
