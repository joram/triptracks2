    "description": "This trail uses the Radium Lake trail, in Chilliwack Provincial Park.  From the Boat launch parking, head west to the bridge going across the chillwack lake/river crossing and follow the signs towards radium lake, Webber Peak.  The trail uses old logging cat trails, and has an older wobbley suspension bridge.  It took us 3.5 hours to get to the lake at a quick pace.  Stop here for a quick lunch, and head another hour and 15mins to the height of land between the peaks of Webber and MacDonald.  It takes about another hour and half to get to MacDonald Peak, and 45 mins if you go to Webber.  It makes for a longs days hike but the views are fantastic.\nYou must be in great shape to do this trail, it goes up forever, with little breaks in gradient.  The last hour and 15 mins is a scramble to peak.",
    "directions": "Chilliwack Lake Road to Provincial park.  Park at the boat launch parking area, washrooms are right there.  Head west along very nice trail, then down 20m when you hit an access road to the bridge trail.",
