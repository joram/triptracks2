    "description": "This is a fairly short and steep trail (elevation gain of around 600 meters in 5.5 km) so the start of the trail is primarily switchbacks.  The climb seems relentless, but it eventually tapers off to a steep downhill that leads to a small lake filled with brown trout.  The views are spectacular, but a guide book or topo may be needed.  NTS Map: 083C08",
    "directions": "Highway 11 west of Rocky Mountain House.  Go past Nordegg until you see a large blue lake on your left (Abraham Lake).  About halfway down the lake (it's a huge lake) you will see a sign that points up the mountain and says \"Allstone's Lake\".  Park in the staging area across the highway.",
