    "description": "Who doesn't like a good mystery...on a Friday...in Nova Scotia!  (Trying to sound like the Oak Island mystery show!; It's a thing on TV in 2020!).  In 1829, TC Halliburton mentions ; a deep ravine, in which ice may be found throughout the summer: it is known by the name of the \u2018Natural Ice-House\u2019\u201d near Granville (Annapolis County, NS).     That sentence set me off on this 11.7 km bushwhack with 450 m elevation gain (and as much loss) to find it.  This was followed by more information such as the B&W postcard (in the photo album) describing the ice \"mine\" at Granville Ferry.  \nAnd the following mention in a document published in the 2000s;  the \u201cIce Caves\u201d in their own right, constitute a significant natural rarity. In fact, the site was a popular tourist attraction in the 1920-1930 era.\n\nSo.....what did I find.....  Well there is definitely lots of scree slopes in three different areas (mapped out for ya!).  One of them definitely had larger holes but nothing to enter easily unless you are a porcupine.  Lastly, lots of colder air seeping of of those holes makes me think there are definitely larger spaces or massage behind these constrictive areas.   Darn, mystery still unsolved!",
    "directions": "The closest area to the  scree is unfortunately DND land so I had to go all the way around from the Bay of fundy side.  I parked at the cemetery (N44\u00b0 47' 58.1\" W65\u00b0 33' 52.3\") and followed one stream then bushwacked to the next one to finally reach a larger stream which I followed to the top of the hill.",
