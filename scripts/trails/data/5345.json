    "description": "The Moab Slickrock Practice Trail is an offshoot of the main trail and can be combined or riden alone.  It is a good warmup and/or shorter ride (4km???!?  C'mon, how short does it have to be?), in a state recreation area, through an area shared with very nice 4x4ers, great views and interesting topography. I keep expecting to see Wile E. splatter down beside me.\nSlickrock et al may well be the best known MTB trail in the universe. It is good, great even, but I'm not sure it totally deserves the 'rep to the point of overshadowing more than a dozen other equally great trails in the area.  But if you're in Moab, you *have* to do Slickrock (as long as you do Porcupine as well).\nSlickrock, the sedimentary building block not the trail, is interesting to ride on. As far as rock goes it may be the perfect riding surface. For a prairie boy, it is really great to try this stuff out. It's name came from what it is to horses hooves, especially when wet. For Specialized Captains though, it don't get any better.\n38m from lowest to highest and none more than 18 meters high at once.  The longest big climb is 18m in 235m of distance, so nothing scary here folks.  It is pretty continuously up and down. Great for riders who don't want to grunt endlessly up a hill and/or use up all that potential energy in one shot down. It can be a little technical, but I don't find it that tough. My S.O. seemed to be freaked out by the rock, but it was all psychological, just transfer your weight correctly and nothin' to it.  If you want to have fun, wheelie over a few drops & make that rear suspension earn it's keep. \nThe town (city?) of Moab is totally in tune with biking. There are rental shops, gear stores, repair places on every corner. The people are the nicest, the food is great and the beer...., well the beer.... - Did I mention you're in Utah? 3.2% is it, but a number of microbreweries make fresh, tasty beers to quench your thirst (and you can't drink enough to get stupid).\nThis trail is right beside:",
    "directions": "Basically right in the middle of Moab. From any of the downtown streets, head East one block, go more South and look for the signs up to Slickrock and/or Sand Flats Recreation Area (and the recycling center). Drive or ride up. Pay your fee (U$5 as of Oct'08) and go about 1km further to the well marked Slickrock trailhead.\nAccommodations:\n\n A lot of people in the MOAB area stay at condos managed by www.moabutahlodging.com, speak with Andrea. They offer a range of in town homes to budget and upscale condos.",
