    "description": "McLennan Lakes is a Canadian Shield canoe trip in Northern Saskatchewan. \nThe region is pock marked with lakes and one can easily extend their canoe trip here to last months.  Plan on paddling 3-4 hours/day and finding a campsite by mid afternoon. Camping is allowed anywhere, but it's best to camp on islands to avoid the bugs. The lakes are warm in the summer months and swimming is a great way to end and to begin each day. The fishing can be very productive with lake trout and northern pike being the dominant species.",
    "directions": "Drive to Lac LaRonge past, Missinippi, north to the put in at Bear Camp. See associated map and GPS data (right) for details.",
