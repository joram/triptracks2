    "description": "NTS Map: 082J14Elevation Gain: 565 m (1,855 ft).Steep up hill trail leads directly to the former Mt Kidd Fire Lookout site. The site is situated on a shoulder of Mt. Kidd (not the summit). There are great views of the Kananaskis Valley including the village and and golf course. (We didn't go all the way but still enjoyed great views and beautiful meadows of wildflowers)",
    "directions": "Park at the farthest south lot for Kananasksis InnHead south from the parking area along the Terrace Tear trail.0.4 km turn west onto Kovach trail.1.5km Keep left on Kovach trail1.8 Veer west off Kovach at a cairn (there is also skull in a tree nearby marking this trail) Be careful there is an incorrect trail nearby.Note: If there still is a route from Kovach (in 2016), it is nearly impossible to find. Even with GPS waypoints and referencing satellite maps, at least one group of hikers was unable to find the way up; bushwhacking was not fruitful as only partial sections of a track were discovered. Double-check your maps and know how you are going to exit the trail before showing up.",
