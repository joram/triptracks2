    "description": "Nice varied hike from an evergreen forest, through arbutus trees to some  great views on top of Mt. Work.  Elevation gain is 330m.  This alternate  route provides a different way up the mountain rather than the usual trail.  \nThe trail up follows a stream.  There is side trip on the way down to an  excellent view point of the Saanich Peninsula.",
    "directions": "The trail head is the Mt. Work park parking lot on Munns Rd ( N 48deg31.031' W123deg29.317' ).",
