    "description": "This is a nice trail for a couples hike. It is not too hard, and there are terrific vistas to stop and gawk. I saw mountain bike tire tracks on parts of the loop, and I was impressed at the skid marks on some of the more difficult rock surfaces.",
    "directions": "Park at the San Ysidro trail head in Monticeto.  Located 1 mile East on #192 of 'Downtown Montecito' (corner of HiWay 192 and San Ysidro Road) then turn North for about 1/2 mile",
