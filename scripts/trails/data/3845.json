    "description": "Hardest at the ends to get to the trailhead. No camping on the trail but you can camp in the shelter areas or reserve a lean-to (costs only a couple bucks a night).  All Seasons are great for hiking it Summer is just hot.",
    "directions": "North trail head is just off of Route 22 on route 51 S.  Just take the Seward exit of 22 head south on 51 and you will see about half a mile passed the gas station on the right.\nSouth Trail head is in Ohioplye, parking area on the last hill going in to Ohioplye on 381S it is on the right but the actuall trail head is down in Ohioplye.  Before the railroad tracks make a right go back about half a mile (passed the Falls City Pub) and you will see steps leading into the Forest this is the trailhead. (you may have to walk to it from the road)",
