    "description": "Beautiful trail in the Algonquin Park, fairly easy most of the way.  Several loops emerge from it.  One can go as far as to the Glacial Boulders or as close as the beautiful High Falls, where many waterfalls, pools and natural water salides can be enjoyed.  The campsides on the shores of lake Stratton are well leveled and have fantastic views. Beware of copious amounts to mosquitoes and blackflies in May and June.",
    "directions": "Take Highway 17 past Pembroke.  3.5km past Forest Lea Road, turn left (South) on County Road 26.  Travel 300m down 26 and turn right into Barron Canyon Rd, a.k.a. County Road 28.  Starting this point the road is gravel and/or broken pavement. 26km into Barron Canyon Road you'll find the Algonquin Park boundary and the Sand Lake Gate, where you must settle your registration and permits.  Travel 19km from the gate down Barron Canyon road and turn left to Achray campground, which is about 5km from this interesection and is the location of the trailhead.",
