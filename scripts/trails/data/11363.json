    "description": "Excellent short loop for snowshoeing, would make a good first outing for those wanting to try the sport.  Simple loop on very well marked trails  in the Sandy McNabb area.  Either direction is good.  Great mix of well treed in trail, some open areas, and an awesome view to the west.  There are trail maps on virtually every intersection, as well as trail markers so it's pretty hard to get misdirected.  Start out to the right of and behind Sheep Station, head north along the fence and follow the maps.",
    "directions": "Make your way to Turner Valley, just west of Black Diamond.  Go through the 4-way stop in Turner Valley heading west following highway 546.  Soon after entering Kananaskis you will find the ranger station on Sheep Station road.  Trail head is behind the station.  Lots of parking.",
