    "description": "From Falkland, head WEST on Highway 97, towards Kamloops. Just past the rodeo grounds, turn right onto the road going to the landfill, and turn left above the landfill site. Continue through the switchbacks, going uphill for the next 7km. A sign here indicates parking. The incline can be very slippery when wet, even for four-wheel drives. The trail is well maintained but is moderately difficult. An area of loose shale poses navigation difficulties for some hikers, and it is quite close to the edge up top. Four to five hours return. Views are tremendous! One can see Paxton Valley north of Falkland and the Monashee Mountains far to the east on a clear day. Many wild flowers, fir, pine and deciduous trees. About 100 metres below the ridge, another rough trail begins. This route is fairly well marked with ribbons and provides an alternate route back (only recommended for those knowledgeable about the area). The weather can change quickly. Bring extra clothing. There may be a cattle gate. Please close it, coming and going.",
