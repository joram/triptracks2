    "description": "A short hike through a mixed forest to a nice 20ft plus waterfall.   What's nice about this one is that I followed this brook to see an old mill site.  The mill site is pretty much non existent.  So I decided to follow the stream up for a while and imagine my pleasant surprise in finding a very nice fall just as I was going to turn around and head back to my car.",
    "directions": "Highway 236.  turn on Loch Haven Lane and head off on a dirt road towards the stream at N45 20 49.1 W63 22 22.8",
