    "description": "NTS Map: 092J03  Brandywine Falls is another great stop when heading south from Whistler.  The walk to the falls is only 10 minutes.  From the view platform which is situated right at the edge of the cliff, you get a spectacular view of the 70 mtr falls.  If you get vertigo you might have to look at the falls from the back of the platform.",
    "directions": "From Whistler head south on Highway 99.  Follow the signs for the Brandywine falls turn off.  Make sure to pay for parking, one hour is more than enough.",
