    "description": "This post is a description of three hikes on three tributaries of Bumpers Brook as they climb to the top of the Cobequids Mountains with some spectacular falls to see along the way.  The height of the falls on this hike range from 10 to well over 100ft.\r\rThe first hike starts at 45\u00b0 25.653'N, 64\u00b0 14.663'W and there is a parking area located to the south side of Highway 2.  The hike described below follows the brook towards the North and up the hill.  There is an old man made pathway to the right of the stream once you cross the highway (looking upstream).  Within two minutes you will come up to a unique ?twin? waterfall.  There are two brooks that converge at the base of the falls but have their own waterfall within 15ft of each other.  This fall location was given to me by another waterfall enthusiast ? Thanks Jeremie !   I climbed the very steep terrain to the right of the waterfalls through a mature evergreen forest to make it to the top of the twin waterfalls.  At this point you can see how the two stream have gouged out huge channels in the bedrock but have stayed in separate streambeds.  The right hand side (facing upstream) branch of the stream has a few more cascades through a mostly evergreen forest.  The other branch which seems to have more water running in it veers to the left and starts to climb a hill covered by both deciduous and evergreen trees.  On the left hand side bank towards the top of the hill you will see evidence of some logging and unfortunately the logging has created a long scree slope right into the brook at one point.  Within about 850m from you starting point you will come up to another 50ft waterfall.  Total distance of this one is 1.5km.  Retrace your steps back to your car and then drive 600m to the east.\r\r\rPark at  45\u00b0 25.635'N, 64\u00b0 14.214'W and set forth into the woods towards the north and the Cobequid Hills.  Here you have to bushwhack a little bit by walking along the stream but soon you enter into a mature deciduous forest where the walking will become easy and the overhead canopy is quite a distance away from you.  The stream meanders a little bit and then you come up to the first waterfall of this portion of the hike.  This is a nice 40ft waterfall.  Climbing to the steep sides of the ravine ion the left hand side of the fall you will come up to another very nice looking (25ft) waterfall located practically above the first fall.  Afterwards, if you continue following this brook upstream, you will notice a logged area to your left (facing upstream).  The forest around the stream has lost its appeal since the logging had happened since there is a lot of deadfall that have obstructed the stream and you have lost a good portion of the overhead canopy.  Regardless, you can follow the stream up to see two more 20ft waterfalls.  The last one is actually in nice settings of a mature evergreen forest which has remained untouched.  I climbed the ravine towards the logged area and then came up into a clear cut area which gave me some views of the five Islands in the Bay of Fundy.  I walked back by way of the logging area to a road which took me within 100ft of the first two waterfall of this hike.  Total distance of this portion of the hike is 2.6km.  Drive another 515m to the east.\r\rPark at  45\u00b0 25.588'N, 64\u00b0 13.821'W and head North into the woods.  Follow the meandering stream into the forest for about 200m and you should hear this fall before you get to it.  This is a 100ft plus waterfall on the main branch of Bumpers Brook.  There is a neat little cave like structure to the left of the fall.  Below the fall is a nice, mature deciduous forest, while the steep banks on each side are covered by mature evergreen trees.  Climb to the left side of the stream (facing upstream), through the mature evergreen forest to the top of the fall.  At the top, you will enter a nice deciduous forest in an area that is relatively flat.  Follow the brook to where it has carved some more waterfalls into the mountain.  There is three more falls to see of about 10- 25 ft.  The last fall is quite nice has it has carved a very narrow passage into the rock. Total distance of this portion of the hike is 1.4km\r\r",
