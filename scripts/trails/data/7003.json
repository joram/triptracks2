    "description": "As Michael Haynes says in his \"Hiking Trails of Nova Scotia\" book, these are the most demanding and rugged trails in the province. Nice look offs, tough climbs and descents, very rugged and rocky terrain, with the rail trail to break things up. We did a figure 8 route starting at Bayers Mill Road, on to the South trail (heading north) for 9k, popping out on the rail trail at Kelly's Junction. 7k north on the rail trail to Gibraltar Rock look off and continuing on the north trail (heading south) to Kelly's Junction (10.8k trail section)...and then finishing with a 7k rail trail run. Total time was 6h25m and a distance of 35.5k...which equalled one tough time! :) Enjoy!",
    "directions": "Start at the Musquodboit Harbour rail trail system (across from the arena/ball field).",
