    "description": "Wyndham Carseland is a provincial park that is SE of Calgary.  The trail is an easy flat route that winds gently through deciduous forest type in the Bow River Valley.  The trail is well groomed and has some gravel.  The trail starts at the Carseland Weir and parallels the Bow River to the north and then east.  The trail is intended as a through route but can be made into a loop by using the campground access road.  There are frequent viewing points of the river along the trail with benches to rest your tired legs.  There is wildlife viewing potential and during my route I saw rabbits, deer, ground nesting birds as well as migratory birds that hang out on the river.  An interesting feature of the trail are the cages surrounding the large deciduous trees to protect them from hungry beavers!",
    "directions": "Proceed to the day use area of Wyndham Carseland Provincial Park where there is ample parking, restrooms, and a small playground.  From there, head north along the river and you will find the trail.",
