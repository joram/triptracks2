    "description": "One of the easiest way to access high Sierra in the Eastern Sierra Nevada range. The trail starts at 10,000 feet, can be reached by car in the summer. With an elevation change of only 1000 feet and nicely maintained trail. This is suitable for any reasonably fit hiker.In the winter, the road is plowed to about five miles from the trailhead. But the trails are groomed for cross-country skiing and snowshoeing. The sno-park fee in the winter is $5.",
    "directions": "Turn off Hwy 395 from Tom's Place. Drive all the way to the end of the road. The trail starts at the end of the parking lot.",
