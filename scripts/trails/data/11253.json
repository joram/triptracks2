    "description": "Kejimkujik National Park offers a couple of short hiking loops and Rgers Brook is one of them.  This loop will take you over the brook on a sturdy bridge and then to a fork.  Doesn't matter which side you take as it is a loop.  The trail then enters a mature conifer forest with little undergrowth and towering canopy.  After exiting the forest you will go along either Rogers Brook or the Mersey River which both are lines with deciduous trees.  The trail has some small boardwalk type construction to go over some of the wet spots.  Short hike but gives you a nice example of the different forest types in Keji",
    "directions": "Caledonia and then north on Highway 8 towards Kejimkujik National Park.  Enter park and continue until you see parking lot for Rogers Brook located on the right hand side of the road",
