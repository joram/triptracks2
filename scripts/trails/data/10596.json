    "description": "The route starts in downtown Prescott Arizona, begins on paved road, then moves into dirt road, then single track and fire roads. This is an awsome endurance course. Two huge climbs, long descents with loose rock, and the water bars!!! Lots of water bars going up and down. The course plays out to 28 miles with 5200 feet of vertical climb. Lots of water crossings too. You can find out more about the race event thru Epic Rides, or just hit the course on your own.  Elevation plays into the ride as well since the entire course is over 5k feet in elevation.The course is not well marked except the weeks leading up to race day in late April but with the GPS data you can find your way.For bike rentals: We rented in Scottsdale (near Phoenix) at AOA-adventures for great weekly rates on GIANT and Specialized, allowing you to ride nearby McDowell Preserve or South Mountain before heading to Sedona for more.",
