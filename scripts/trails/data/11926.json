    "description": "This is a linear trail on the dykelands between Port Williams and Wolville.  There is a parking lot just by the bridge to Port Williams with a couple of interpretive signs.  The trail is super flat and offers good opportunities for bird watchers.  One of the beast feature is right next door as there is a micro brewery (Sea Lebel) just across the Cornwallis River from the trail.",
    "directions": "Highway 358 directions Port William from Highway 1 or 101.  The parking is next to the bridge over the Cornwallis River.",
