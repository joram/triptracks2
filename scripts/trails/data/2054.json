    "description": "A very good XC trail with some single-track offshoots of varying difficulty.\r\rFor a 10km XC ride: start out on the right fork of Red Pine Trail and head to the Crossroads; do the Chickadee-Footloose loop; and then complete the Red Pine.  This is a fairly easy route with some good climbs.\r\rFor a technical, single-track, challenge take the left fork and follow the orange markers.  After 100m you will find an area with ramps, catwalks, TT, etc.  If you keep going the trail gets difficult-extreme for about 0.5km.  You then need to take the road for 300m to the alternate entrance to Red Pine Trail.  This double-track has a number of technical, single-track, side trails.\r\rThis trail is owned, operated, and maintained by Calabogie Peaks Resort.  There is a daily fee of $6.",
    "directions": "From Ottawa: Take Hwy 417 West ( Hwy 417 becomes Hwy 17 on leaving Ottawa), continue past Arnprior on Hwy 17 for approx. 20 kms to the junction of Hwy 17 and Calabogie Road (County Rd 508).\rTurn left and continue on County Rd 508 through the town of Burnstown and past the town of Calabogie.
