    "description": "Well signed from route 430, you can't miss it.  Easy parking then across the road to the boardwalk leading to the Throlombites, which are best described as giant sea buns.  These mounds were the only organic life (i.e. we evolved from them) some 3.5 billion to 350 million years ago.  Very (very) rare to see these rocks / fossils, the formations are interesting, the boardwalk quite easy.\r\rEqually compelling on the horizon, we spotted the rotting hulls of old fishing vessels and their wrecked repair facility.  This graveyard of several boats was just a short walk back the boardwalk and down a road, which may well have been private, but we took a few photos and returned.  The extra walking to this point creates a 2km walk all in -- helpful.  \r\rA good walk along a traditional footpath -- we had an evening waiting at St. Barbe for the AM Labrador ferry.",
    "directions": "St. Barbe ferry to Flowers Cover is not very far (15km) and the walking trails are very well marked, you'll see a sign indicating they are 14km away, and, another as you approach the turn off by the sea.  Parking area is provided, the hike starts just off the highway.",
