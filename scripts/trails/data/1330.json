    "description": "NTS Map: 092G01\r\nA short 1.6 loop trail that climbs 150 meters from the trailhead on the Dewedney Trunk road to a viewpoint overloking the Stave Dam area of Mission - there are a number of interpretative signposts but no sign of any booklets explaining the signposts - this trail can be wet in bad weather but for those out for a drive wanting a little exercise this would will the bill - those doing the Hayward Reservior trail could add this to their day.",
    "directions": "Drive out the Dewedney Trunk Road and shortly after crossing the Stave Dam and visiting the Historical dam site climb up the road and you some steps and a signpost on your left heading east - this is the start of the trail - the Reservoir trail is on the opposite side of the road.",
