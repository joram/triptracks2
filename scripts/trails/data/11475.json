    "description": "This is an east extension of the Banff Legacy trail. It makes access to the Banff Legacy trail much easier and safer as there is no longer a need to cross the highway.I wouldn't ride this trail on it's own but use it as access to the Banff Legacy trail",
    "directions": "At the Alberta Tourist info centre in Canmore, there is a new section of the parking lot dedicated to users of the Legacy trail",
