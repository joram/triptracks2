    "description": "First part of this is through Northwest Forest and is maintained by them so the parking lot has fees. The only problem when I was there, didnt see any box to pay the fee. So I left a note saying that i thought it was part of Nation Parks and they left me a fee to pay later of 5$ for parking. Got a 30$ northwest forest pass for a year after that so i can go in the mt Baker area where the pass is required. After the first km you will have a junction where you go left. After a bit you will enter Olympic National Park. Its 700 m elevation to the lake and 11.5 km then to Royal basin is another 200 m and 2 km after the campground. so up to you to organise how you want to do it. I slept at the lake and left my tent then hiked in the morning to the basin. Beautiful area not very busy, what you need is a permit to camp there 5$ a night in order to insure you have a spot and they control the impact on the area that way. Lots of marmots when i was there.",
    "directions": "From Sequim, drive east on hwy 101. At about mile 267 turn right on Palo Alto road. Keep giong on this road until it turns to gravel on FR 28. Another 5 or 6km more to FR 2860. Turn left and another 16 km do not take FR2870. You will arrive at a parking lot of the upper dungeness trailhead. Part of Northwest Forest.",
