    "description": "There are numerous trails in the Dewdrop area north of Kamloops Lake.  This trail, locally known as the Classic, is located within the Lac Du Bois Grasslands Proteced Area.The trail starts off on an old road that winds through sage brush and Ponderosa Pine for about 0.6 kilometre. The trail then crosses a barb wired fence then ascends through a Douglas Fir forest. The trail climbs gently at first but soon steepens up.  Portions of the trail are quite steep.  After about 2 km's the grade eases somewhat and comes to a fork.  The left fork goes to a viewpoint (about another 200 metres) and the right fork continues up a ridge to the top of the Dewdrop.  It is about 2.25 km from the trail head to the view point with about a 300 metre gain in elevation.As the trail is predominantly south facing, it is snow free early in the spring.  In summer it is best to hike this trail early in the morning when it is cool.",
    "directions": "From Kamloops, follow Tranquille Road to Tranquille On The Lake.  At this point the main road becomes Tranquille-Criss Creek (Red Lake) Road.  Set your odometer to zero at this point.  Continue up the main road 4.3 km to Frederick Road (gravel).  Follow Frederick Road 0.6 km to a parking area (trail head) on the north side of the road.",
