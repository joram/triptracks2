    "directions": "Easy access:From Hwy 550, we used the route at Nageezi  Is/Rt451 - Co/Rd7800 -  Is/Rt452 - Hwy57, fully paved for a few miles, wide and well used for all the 12 miles to the junction with road 57, which is 3 miles from the trailhead.Leave your car on Hwy57(almost no traffic - only used by local people) and follow the trail for 0.6 mi to the old official parking place then further north until you reach the rim.  Follow the gps track and you will find easily how to get down into the wilderness area.",
