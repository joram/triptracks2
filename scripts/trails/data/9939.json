    "description": "Ross Creek Ski Trail is maintained and groomed by the Teulon Ski Club. If people plan to ski there on a regular basis it would be a good idea to join the club. The trail meanders up, down and across the wooded Ross Creek ravine. Four private land owners have permitted the club to create and maintain this excellent trail. There are two warm up huts, and the trail passes through mature hardwood forests of aspen, oak, and ash trees. It also passes through old homesteads with collapsing pioneer houses, sheds and barns. Opportunities for wildlife watching and photography abound.",
    "directions": "From Winnipeg travel north on Highway 7, turn left on Section Road 91 Road North (hint 2 miles north of the Gunton turnoff, or 2 miles south of PR415 and Highway 7). Travel west on 91 Road North for 0.4 miles. Look for the ski trail into the wood. Park on the south side of the road.",
