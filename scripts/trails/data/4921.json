    "description": "This is a great beginner backpacking trip that is also great for a solo trip. The trip is designed as a yo-yo to Bear Mtn. and back to the trail head. When we did the trip we parked at the overnight parking on Bunker Hill Road. There is a trail right at the parking lot that will take you to the AT. The trail first takes you to the top of Lion's Head, a great look out. The AT then continues up Bear Mtn. the highest point in CT. We then headed back down the trail to one of the shelters we passed along the way.\nThere are two shelters one at the bottom of Bear Mtn. and another one, Riga, that is closer to Lion's head and the parking lot. We stayed at Riga, it has some great over looks. The next day we woke up and headed down to the parking lot.",
    "directions": "The trail head is located off Rt. 44. Take a right off Rt. 44 north on to Washinee St. Then at the fork go right on to Bunker Hill Road the trail head is about a mile from that point.",
