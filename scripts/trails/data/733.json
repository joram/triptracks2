    "description": "Only half-an-hour drive from Kamloops, this hike takes you through a pleasant mix of forest--Douglas-fir trees, pine trees and aspen. Once you reach the rocky bluff, you are rewarded with spectacular views over Paul Lake and Harper Mountain, as well as a bird?s eye view of ospreys, swallows and the rare white-throated swift. Paul Lake Provincial Park also provides habitat for a variety of wildlife, including bald eagles, falcons, white-throated swifts, coyotes and mule deer.\r\nTotal elevation gain on your trip is about 900m.  Once you come back down, Paul Lake and its 400m of sandy beach are perfect for relaxing. Also, there?s a popular campground directly at the lakeshore, offering sites for 90 vehicles. Note that the above stated distance is for the round trip.",
    "directions": "From Hwy #5, go five km north of Kamloops, and then go east onto Paul Lake Rd for about 19 km. There are signs to Paul Lake Provincial Park. The campground is located on the north side of Paul Lake, about 15-20 minutes driving distance.\r",
