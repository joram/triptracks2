    "description": "Tbis is a hike to a couple of really small falls on the Sam Cameron Brook near St Pauls, Nova Scotia.  Right next to this brook is the Glencoe Brook which has a massive waterfall.  my thought was the valley next to it would yield a similar sight!After going almost 3.5km one way....I was disappointing to only find a couple of small drops.  The walk up the valley is pretty good, some of the trees are majestic and there are some rock walls on the west side of the valley that I hope would yield some climbing opportunities but they weren't steep enough.  I did find a small opening of a cave but a porcupine is a resident in that one!",
    "directions": "Highway 348 south of New Glasgow.  the brook flows under the highway at 20 T 533682 5029742 and it is located befiore the McLellan Mtn- Glencoe Rd",
