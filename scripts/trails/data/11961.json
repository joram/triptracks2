    "description": "Ribbon Creek is said to be one of the most popular hikes in Kananaskis.  Parts of it were heavily damaged in the June 2013 floods.  The GPS track I have attached is of the new route recorded July 11, 2015.  This was my first time on the trail but clearly all of the bridges were wiped out in the 2013 flood because all of the bridges are brand new (the first and largest bridge did not have handrails up yet as of July 11, 2015).  Basically, they have diverted hikers off the original trail (that was down closer to the creek) up onto one of the nearby cross country skiing trails for a few kilometres before joining back to the original trail (I imagine is was more scenic to travel along the creek in this first section in the pre-flood days).  There are lots of small creek crossings water falls along the way (starting at about 6 kilometres in)  which I imagine would be fun for kids to look at.  Many of the these little falls would be a destination in themselves on other trails.  However, they pale in comparison to the big falls at the end of the trail.  We did not make the extra effort to try the last 2 k straight up to Ribbon Lake (guide books make it sound like a pretty arduous and dangerous diversion).  The approx 400 metre gain from the parking lot to the falls is spread relatively evenly over the hike.",
    "directions": "Take the turn off to Kananaskis Village/Nakiska ski resort.    First left and then turn into Ribbon Creek parking lot.  There are several parking lots.  The trail head is at the western end of the last parking lot.",
