    "description": "Eagle's Nest is a great example of urban climbing at its best. (for atlantic canada anyway) The cliffs overlook the Bedford Basin, and are south facing.\r\n\r\nThere are numerious lines that are wide ranging in skill levels. A book has been published outlining the names and grades of the routes.\r\n\r\nClimb Nova Scotia conducts much of their instruction in this area due to its close proximity.\r\n\r\nIf you live in Halifax, Eagle's Nest is your \"climb after work\" spot.",
    "directions": "A map can be obtained thru mapquest.\r\n\r\nMap Quest Link.\r",
