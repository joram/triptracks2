    "description": "Elevation gain: 150 m (to lookout). \r\nElevation loss: 250 m (from lookout to lake).\r\nThe Hidden Lake trail is one of those short gems that anyone can enjoy, at least to the lookout (2.5km). Unfortunately, with a trail this good and this easy, it's like downtown at rush hour on any day in July or August.\r\nStarting at the Logan Pass visitor centre in Glacier National Park\r\n, the trail follows a paved, then boardwalk trail through alpine meadows filled with endless wildflowers. This portion is 2.5km and gains 150m in elevation. At the end is a spectacular viewpoint, overlooking Hidden Lake, Bearhat Mt and Mt Reynolds. Most of the tourists stop here.\r\nThe trail to the lake is a 2.5km descent of 250m of moderate, rocky switchbacks. The 10km distance is return.",
    "directions": "The trail starts behind the Logan Pass visitor centre in Glacier National Park. Just follow the hordes, but PLEASE stay on the trail.",
