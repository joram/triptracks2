    "description": "This is a series of falls with the tallest about 8 feet.  These wouldn't be that special except they are located in an area with no a lot of known waterfalls.   I used my waterfall instincts to check out this unnamed stream as it had a good topography drop.   I bushwhacked from Morley Road (hence the name) and found myself along the brook in a minute to two.  The brook has carved  a small ravine like feature and the 8ft fall has a deep pool in front of it perfect for relaxing.  Upstream of it are more cascade type falls set in a small ravine.  Some of the hemlocks growing on the side of the brook are a sight to behold.",
    "directions": "Marion Bridge.  Turn on Grand Mira North Rd towards the west.  The brook crosses this road just before Morley Road.  Follow it upstream to the falls.",
