    "description": "Terwillegar is park that has mountain biking and also a large off-leash area.  This path takes you through dirt trailed bush onto a short paved part turning around by the bridge, ending with a loop around the off-leash area (don't worry, I've never had a dog chase after me).",
    "directions": "Rabbit Hill Rd goes into Terwillegar park and the trail head is about where the parking lot starts.  It starts off going SW.",
