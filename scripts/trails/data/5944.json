    "description": "This is one of those places that is so under-used that even most locals don't know about it, so consider yourself privileged. It's an old access road to a decommissioned reservoir, and lake beyond. The original gate with tough-sounding warning signs is still up, which keeps out most, if not all, motorized toys.\rIt's a great ride for a x-country cycle because the road is wide enough to make it navigable, steep enough to make it a work-out, but not so steep you'll wish you'd brought armour. Best of all, in the ultra heat of the summer, there's always the lake. While not a glacial gem, it serves its purpose.\rYou can personalize your workout according to how far you drive up the road. My personal choice for a pull-out is just across from the last drive-way you'll encounter - after this the road gets sketchier - still very much drivable, but why stress the car? \rThe road will switchback twice, and in about 20 minutes (foot speed) it will turn due south into the shade of the forest (a good place to park if you haven't already). In only 10 minutes from here you will encounter the dreaded gate. It is easy to walk or push a bike around, but the signs tend to make people nervous. Ignore them. Sure, it's technically private property, but the reservoir is no longer used and nobody will be checking on you. Venture forth without shame or worry!\rThe road continues its steady incline through the woods and some open spaces, a creek sputtering alongside the trail now and again. There are stretches where the midday sun would pound down on the trail, so bring a hat or time your trek/ride appropriately. In 30 minutes you arrive at a junction with the pipeline road - an alternate route to here via logging roads from Rossland. Moments later, you'll see the weir and the road evens out to a pleasant flat that winds along the shore of the reservoir. More signs will warn you away, but again, nobody has bothered to take them down, that's all. \rIf riding, you can really tear through here, as the road is pretty solid and you only need to worry about bears crossing your path.\r3 km farther on, with some elevation gain between the bodies of water, you will hit the larger, more natural, Violin lake. An old track peters along its east shore if you feel like doing more exploring, but the main road ends here.\r",
    "directions": "Whatever you do, don't doubt your way. There are no signs, and barely any street markers in Warfield, so just trust these directions and the GPS waypoints!\rFrom Trail, head north on Hwy 3B, 3km from downtown. Moments after passing an old railway overpass, you will see the Ray Lynn motel and Trail Treasure Chest on your left. Take this turn and you'll find yourself on Wellington Ave, though you might not know it. If you pass a cement plant, you're on the right track. A few blocks along you will wind with the road left at French Street and cross a bridge. After the bridge turn right (Haig St - good luck finding a sign). Another few blocks along there will be a dirt road Y that splits sharply uphill to the east and west - west is just someone's house, east is the way you want to go. Again, no signs, but it's the only road heading into the uplands. If you get to another bridge, you've just missed it.\r100m along the road switchbacks to the right, and a road continues forward but is clearly someone's driveway. About 1/2km along there will be stone gate posts leading to another home on the left - this is a good place to park, though the road ahead isn't too bad.\rSee trail description for parking details if you want to carry on in the car.",
