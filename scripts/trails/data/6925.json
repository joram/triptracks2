    "description": "Pocaterra Cirque is the source of Pocaterra Creek. The trail is unofficial and not marked but it's used as the trail to Mount Tyrwhitt. We only went to the cirque but there is a very visible trail from the cirque to Grizzly col.Trail starts at Highwood pass and first goes through the forest an over a ridge. \nOn July 24, 2010 is was muddy in many places also higher up we had to cross snow in several places. We did see a Grizzly bear near a meadows in the area so be prepared. It's a really scenic trail that passes a small shallow lake along the way.",
    "directions": "Starting from Highwood Pass parking lot on Highway 40, head towards the interpretive loop trail at sign which says some like respect the environment stay on trails follow the dirt trail, that's it.",
