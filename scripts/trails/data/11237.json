    "description": "Another short hike near highway 103.  I had always seen this spot but never had the chance to explore before.  Just past the Tantallon exit, there is a large hill overlooking the power plant at Mill Cove.  Near the top of the hill you can clearly see from the highway some kind of post.I set off from the highway on an old atv or logging road.  It passes through some mixed forest and except for a few down trees it's pretty easy to walk.  There are a few wet spots but nothing to sink into.  The trail actually leads you away from the small hill before climbing back to it so you end up coming in from behind.  At the top of the hill is an old structure that looks like an outhouse.  To the edge of the hill, you can a spectacular view down below of Mill cove, the power plant and the highway.  It's a short hike to do when you cannot escape from the city and fun since you see this spot travelling back and forth from the south shore.On my way back I just descended the hill towards the highway.  It shortened the trail by from 2 km to about 750m .  At the base of the hill towards the highway I spotted a trail that probably leads you right to the top from the lake beside the highway",
    "directions": "Highway 103, past exit 5 Tantallon, you can park just before the tall rocky cliffs ...you should be able to find the old path or park by the side of the small lake by the highway.",
