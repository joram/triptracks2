    "description": "Edwards Rating: I (I) L L - Moderate if going down directly under the south summit with a bit of exposure & bushwhacking (our GPS track)Elevation of 1325 m NET, 1629 m TOT and max 2694 m for north summit & 2513 m for south Summit 7 to 9 hoursThis is an official trail, a long and beautiful loop with awesome views in two valleys surrounding Kindersley north and south summits. The elevation for the day including the two peaks is quite high, but most of it is gradual and quite easy. It?s more a hike than a scramble, unless you leave the official trail to go back down under the south summit as we did. I rated it as difficult because of its length and total elevation, but there?s not much technical scrambling here.From the Kindersley pass parking lot, cross the street and go all the way to the pass. You will see a large gully after crossing two creeks at about 7.5 km mark. You can scramble up that gully to reach the north peak on your left. We didn?t as it was snowy so we completed the pass trail, kept going on the loop bringing us back at mid point in that gully. From there, we started scrambling to the first peak almost straight up avoiding the steepest sections, angling right at the end for an easy way up to the ridge. At this point, we were just a few minutes from the summit on our left. Another option is to stay on the official trail up to the col and turn left to complete the north peak ascent. We descended back to the col and up to the south summit. The best option from there is to go back down to the col and take the official Sinclair Creek Trail bringing you back to the highway.  Bushwhacking and route finding is involved if you go down under the south summit and it was not really fun. When you reach the highway, you need to walk down the road for about 1km to get back to your car.",
    "directions": "From Radium Hot Springs Highways 95 & 93 junction, drive for about 12 km east on Highway 93 and look for Kindersley Pass sign on your left. The parking lot will be on your right, but the trailhead is across the road.",
