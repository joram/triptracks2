    "description": "Really nice hike, typical scenery for this area. Lots of mossy rocks and muddy trails. There are many trails and it can get a bit confusing in here. But it's not a huge area, you're bound on all sides by water or roads. Watch for downhill mountain bikers as this is a multi-use trail.",
    "directions": "From West Saanich Road, you have a few options:1. Take Durrance Road and go all the way to the end2. Take Wallace Drive and then Willis Point Road, park at the Durrance Lake Parking Lot (Durrance Close)3. Take Wallace Drive, Willis Point Road past Durrance Road. There are several trail heads along Willis Point Road.",
