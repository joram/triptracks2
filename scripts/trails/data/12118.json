    "description": "The name of this geocache was too good to pass up.   Setting off from the dirt road, I climbed a small hill and then my gps was pointing down a very steep gully.  I made it down the scree slope and walked upstream in a small brook.  Finally I saw some rope to the right and climbed up a somewhat steep hill to an entrance!Well it's not a cave but its cool nonetheless it's an old mining adit.",
    "directions": "Drive to Arising and hike up the dirt road found at N45 45.511 W62 09.812.  The adit is approx at N45 45.192 W62 09.747",
