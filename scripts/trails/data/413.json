    "description": "Lower Fromme has been buffed up for twoonie races.  These lower trails prove that not all trails on Fromme involve 4 feet of air.  Great for XC riding, for twoonie racing, or for getting used to Fromme.\nCheck  NSMBA  for race times. This group has done a great job on the race route.\nEveryone is welcome. You don't have to be a pro to race these, and in fact the crew at trailpeak would really appreciate a few slower riders to ride with.  Come on out.  It's a great group, and a great cause - NSMBA also does trail maintenance on the North Shore and acts as a trail advocacy to keep trails open, so by doing the race, you help the cause.\nMore Mt Fromme mountain biking trails can be found here.",
