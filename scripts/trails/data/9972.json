    "description": "A well signed, fairly easy (with a couple notable short but steep hills), NEW trail just for snow shoers near Bragg Creek.  At just under 6km it is an easy walk but has several other optional trails in the area so you can make a longer day of it if desired.\nThis trail  winds and dips and doodles through the trees and deer poop in a really back country feeling area that is easy to get to and easy to navigate.  New for the 2010-11 winter (I think), the signage and route are first class.",
    "directions": "West of Calgary to Bragg Creek (17km S of Hiway 1 on Hiway 22), go into Bragg Creek, past the 2 small strip malls, and find the bridge in front of the T interesction with a stop sign.  Turn left and go 9km to West Bragg parking lot (at gated end of road).  Trail starts in the NE corner of lot and is well signed.",
