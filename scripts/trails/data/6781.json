    "description": "Although Eagle Mountain was owned by Hoyt Family, it was donated to Lake Champlain Land Trust in 1995.  This is unpopular mountain, however, it's very good hiking spot for beginners, small kids and dogs. \rThere are 7 trails network on this mountain and it looks confusing at the first time visit.  GPS would help where you are. The trail #2 connects to the summit of the Eagle Mtn and the trail #1 connects to the best view point (Hoyt Lookout) to see beautiful view of Lake Champlain and ADK in NY.   Since this is very small mountain (ascent elevation is 560 ft), whole exploring will be done about an hour or so.",
    "directions": "Take I-89 to Exit 17.  Go west on Route 2 for 2.4 miles.  Turn right onto Bear Trap Rd.  After 1.8 miles, the road folks.  Bear left toward barn.
