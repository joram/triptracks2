    "description": "This trail descends slowly through a wide and open valley.  On the north side are some large rock cliffs.  It is an easy wide gravel trail with nothing crazy.  The beach on Kalmalka Lake is a popular swimming place, and the colour of the water is cool as the depths change.  There are washrooms (pit toilets) at the beach.   For a different view, take the sidewinder trail to return.  It joins back up with Cosens Bat Trail about 1/2 way back.  The 7 km is return distance.  Its a popular trail in the summer, so expect to meet people on bikes, horses and walking.",
    "directions": "Take Klamalka Lake Rd. off Highway 97.  Go through most of Coldstream and watch for the blue sign pointing to Kalmalka Lake Park and Cosens Bay.   You will past the first park turnoff, but the trail head for this one is on the 2nd turnoff, about 2 km down. There is one dodgily marked turnoff that is a sharp hairpin, but don't worry, the trail is not difficult to find.",
