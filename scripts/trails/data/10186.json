    "description": "This short but steep hike takes your from the summit rest area to the tippy-top of a ridge overlooking the mountains separating Salmo from Creston.\r\rYou can approach from either end of the small lake at the summit and just make sure you take any junction heading upward. It's a bit of a no-nonsense trail that simply climbs, yet the grade remains managable (no knee-to-chin moments).\rAs you gain elevation the trees begin to slip away and you can see the lake below, Ripple Ridge across the highway, and for many miles in each direction.\rAfter about 30 minutes you find yourself at the base of a very obvious ridge (with snowy cornices lingering into July - hence the name!) \rSimply continue up the ridge until you can climb no more! You will pass an avalanche detonation station along the way.",
    "directions": "From Salmo, head east along HWY 3 to the top of the Salmo-Creston summit (there is a lake, a highway works station... and the road stops climbing). From Creston, head west along HWY 3 until you reach the top of the road.\rPark on the east side of the lake and follow the trail above the outhouse. It will be signed as leading to a cabin in 2km, but there is a spur leading upward that is quite obviously the way to gain elevation.",
