    "description": "NTS Map: 082O06Elevation Gain: 892 m (2,927 ft).You'll head along the Ghost River to the foot of Blackrock Mountain. You'll follow the old telephone line up the mountain to the fire lookout. The trail is steep in some places and will require a bit of scrambling to reach the top. However, it will all be worth it, the view of the Devils Head and Ghost River region will be incredible. (9 km to the lookout).",
