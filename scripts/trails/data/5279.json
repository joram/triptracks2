    "description": "The trail can be an out and back or a loop (with partially logged areas)so the time is between 1 and 2 hours.  Consisting of roots, rocks and small steep rock faces that can be ridden down.  Lots of fun here with options for harder or easier parts depending on your ability, there is nothing that would be considered extreme.  It can be ridden year round if there is no snow.  This is part of the trans Canada Trail.",
    "directions": "Follow 7th street out of Nanaimo until you get to the power lines, park on the side of the road, trail starts to the south just down the powerline road about 100m, start climbing to the right when you see a set of stairs.",
