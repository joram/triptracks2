    "description": "A *HUGE* network of very buff, narrow, singletrack that is in GREAT shape.  We did it as a cross country ride starting from the trailhead mentioned below.  From the start we rode up Moose Drop, crossed a couple quad tracks, then got onto 'Two Fridges' (alas, they were empty), onto Guiness (sic) - the Beer is called Guinness (with 2 n's) but the printed maps differ.  Onto Leopard Spots, Twizzler I think and a bunch more riding to the East and back.  We did 20km, coulda done 20 more.Quite often we were on the course for their 6 Hour Enduro, Pedal by the Puddle (early June (June 9 in 2013)) and it is a great circuit that is rideable by anyone but can keep serious XCers entertained (just lets them go faster).Their brochure reports this as 'one of the largest legal trail systems in Beautiful British Columbia and has some of the tightest, fastest and flowiest singletrack around' and I'd agree.The town itself is also *very* nice, decent hotels and local restaurants, good bike shops.  I randomly went into Barking Spider downtown and the fellows there bent over backwards to make sure I could find my way around, I'm not sure I've ever talked to two guys who like and support biking more (Thanks guys!).Also the area has a number of partners in the trails, the Province of BC, Tourism, the Cariboo Chilcotin Coast Region, Williams Lake Cycling Club, Cariboo Mountain Bike Consortium, and the first nations of Northern Shuswap Nation and Williams Lake Indian Band.  All of these groups deserve our thanks and respect for getting it totally together out here!Go to Williams Lake !  You'll thank me.",
    "directions": "There are a few places to access this network, here's a reasonable one for first timers:Find South Lakeside Drive near the Canadian Tire and head SouthEast.  Just past Prosperity Drive (up to the WalMart... oh the irony) there is a parking area on the N side of the road, park there.  Ride across the road (look both ways !!) and you'll see a trail heading up the trees just to the East of Prosperity Drive.  There is a cable stretched between two trees with some survey flagging and a No Trespassing sign, that's the bottom of Moose Drop and a good starting place.",
