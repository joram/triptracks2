    "description": "This 9 km loop follows Smugglers Ridge and Duffless mountain bike trails along with some un-signed trails, and closed logging roads. It includes views from the top edge of the Oyster River valley as well as trails the follow the edge of the river. There are a few short steep hills. I prefer to go up the steepest parts so I hike the loop counter clockwise.",
