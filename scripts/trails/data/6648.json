    "description": "Something you need a break from driving from NB/PEI to Halifax or Cape Breton.  Here is a description of a trail located at the top of the Wentworth Valley. \nPark by the railroad track and follow it by going underneath the highway.   (looking out for the sound of any on coming train traffic) Continue by the track until you cross a stream.  Head upstream.  Immediately you will come to an area where the stream cascades down over about 20ft over rocks.  There are at least 4-5 other falls afterwards so continue heading upstream.  The forest is a mix of evergreen and some fairly mature deciduous trees.  There isn?t much downfall to go over so it?s an easy walk.  \nAfter you have seen enough go up the steep ravine to your left to cut across the forest and back down to the highway instead of following the stream back down.  At the top of the ravine you will cross an ATV path going further into the woods.  Good exploring opportunity !!!",
    "directions": "Take highway 4 towards Wentworth Valley and exit at the quarry.  Park underneath the overpass of the highway by the railroad track.",
