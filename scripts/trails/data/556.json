    "description": "A short 3 km one way trip to one of the beaches and viewpoints within Belcarra Regional Park.\r\nThe trail starts by the picnic shelter, crosses Bedwell Bay road and then winds its way up and down through mixed forests with some open views of Bedwell Bay until you drop down to Jug Island beach after about 45 minutes of walking.\r\nMuch of the trail is an old road and the GVRD has updated other sections with wooden stairs etc.\r\nThe trail will be wet in the winter or after a heavy rain as water likes to take the path of least resistance and in some parts of the trail it is also the creek bed.  There is a short trip near the start to a bluff overlooking Bedwell Bay. There is GPS data attached to this trail (see \"download GPS\"), which if loaded into your GPS can help you find route points.",
    "directions": "Drive through Port Moody to the Ioco Rd turnoff and then follow the signs to Belcarra Regional Park.  Do not turn in at White Beach, but continue west until you see the new access road to the parking area at the picnic site.\r\nIt is also possible to do this hike by taking the bus to Belcarra--it will drop you off at the entrance to the picnic area.\r",
