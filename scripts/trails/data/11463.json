    "description": "This is an itinerary that can be used to go ice climbing at Schooner lake.  The start point is the end of logging / cottage road that ends at lake.  We started skiing on the lake and got to the climb in about two hours.  Skiing is flat for the most part as it's on two lakes, although the start has a bit of climbing / descending before the lake is reached.  That's the best way we found to get to the ice climbing spot on Schooner lake",
    "directions": "Drive to Pleva, north of Hwy 7.  From the center of the village, you will find Mountain Rd going North.  Follow this road and at the fork take a right (left becomes Brule lake road).  Continue driving to Makie Lake, or until the snow conditions allow.  There is a radio / cell tower a few km before Mackie lake, where there is enough space to park in the winter.  The GPS track starts at that location.",
