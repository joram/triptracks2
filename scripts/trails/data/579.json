    "description": "NTS Map: 92G6. This route takes you up the backside of Mt. Strachan. This route is not on the Cypress Provincial Park map, but it has a nice view of Howe Sound and is harder than going up the front side. This is not a trail; it is a route; it is hardly used.",
    "directions": "To start, go to Cypress Bowl. Take the Howe Sound Crest Trail until about 1.7 km past the Bowen lookout. You will notice that there is a small valley behind Mt. Strachan. There is usually a small stream going down that valley. Follow the markers up that valley. When you are at the top of the valley the trail will split. The trail that goes east will take you to a viewpoint, but it is a DEAD END TRAIL. If you head west that will take you to the top of Mt. Strachan and you follow the trail and the ski runs down the front side of the mountain back to the parking lot.\r\n\r\n\r\nsome cool footage launching from Strachan\r\n\r\n \r\n\r",
