    "description": "This hike can only be done at low tide.  There is no escapes from the sea floor except where some of the stream have carved down the cliffs.  This is a there and back kind of adventure.  As soon as you leave your car, you will be amazed by the sights of the Bay of Fundy, the high cliffs and the many waterfalls!The cliffs are straight down and offer lots of waterfalls and I am sure ice climbing in the winter.  There are some rock slides to go around but not took many.  the colours of the cliffs vary from black to orange to yellow.  Lots of some kind of geodes, quartzes everywhere.   Some small sea caves to visit as well but nothing major. There is a side attraction.  If you go upstream of the main stream (Sheffield Vault brook), you will see a 12ft waterfall at about 600m one-way.  Where the stream flow into the Bay of Fundy you will also spot some camps..what a spot to spend the night!",
    "directions": "Highway 221.  Turn on Black Hole Rd.  Up the mtn, turn left on Gospel Woods Rd.  turn right on Long Beach Rd.  Park at the Bay of Fundy and walk towards the west.",
