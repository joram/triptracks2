The view from the top looks over the Cascades to the Coastal Mountains.  The Needle is recommended for experienced hikers only.  See same peak described in another trailpeak entry here.First hour and one half very steep uphill climb after which become easy mountain meadow walk with faboulous vista. Last hour is a scramble over rocks and steep climbs, well worth it.",
