    "description": "An extremly short hike to a small waterfall carving its way into some sort of conglomerate.  There is a nice and well used camping spot upstream of the fall.  There isn't much of a hike here to get to the fall as it is close to the road but a good pic nic spot.",
    "directions": "Highway 10 near sussex.  turn on Pleasant Ridge Rd and continue left on the same road where it split into a Y.  then left on Schofield Rd and left on Steen R.  the fall is downstream of the bridge/culvert over the Beatty Brook",
