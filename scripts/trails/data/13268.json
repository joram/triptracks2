    "description": "Towards the end of the Broad Cove Banks Rd, where your car may have bottomed out a few times ,lies a place called Port Ban cove on the topo maps but the local call it Magic cove.I parked by the edge of a field where a sign indicated not to drive unto it.  There was an evident path leading to the cove.  A short walk of no more than a few minutes led me down to the brook which flowed into the cove via a small 8ft waterfall.   The wind was howling on the day I was there and I couldn?t make my way to the cove to the right of the waterfall.",
