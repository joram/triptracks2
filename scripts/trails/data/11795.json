    "description": "It is easy to get lost from Deep Cove to Lynn Canyon. Lots of mountain bikers use this section because of mountain bike trails that share this area. Once we passed the suspension bridge, the markers were easy to find. The route also became a bit more technical, more ups and down. Highly recommend doing this in one day.",
    "directions": "Head east on Mount Seymour PKWY. TO Deep Cove RD. and turn left. and follow until you see Panorama Dr. witch is in \"Down Town\" Deep Cove. Turn Left on Panorama Dr. drive along Panorama Dr. about 300m and the trail head is on your left. it starts about 10m up a shared driveway.",
