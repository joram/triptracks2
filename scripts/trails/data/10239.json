    "directions": "Echo lake is across the mouth of the squamish river.  Follow signs to the \nwindsurfing access road. Once eyou reach the dyke alongside the river, drive \n500m and park your car. There are several good places to launch your boat \nfor the short trip across the river. There is a small back channel with some old \npilings. Pull your boat well out of the water as this is a tidal area.  \nAlternatively Squamishriverjet.ca can take you across for a fee.",
