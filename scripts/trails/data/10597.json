    "description": "This trail is nice trail to get out in the Arizona desert and roll on some non-technical trails.  This trail is not as rocky as other Phoenix area trails such as Trail 100 and National.  There are several other shorter trails in the area and there is also overnight camping and bathrooms in the park.For bike rentals: We rented in Scottsdale (near Phoenix) at AOA-adventures for great weekly rates on GIANT and Specialized, allowing you to ride nearby McDowell Preserve or South Mountain.",
    "directions": "From Phoenix area, get on the 101 and head to east side of loop( either N or S) . Near Scottsdale take the Shea blvd exit and head east towards Fountain Hills. Take a left on Mcdowell mtn park road and go approximately 10 miles. Take left in to park. Follow the signs from there.",
