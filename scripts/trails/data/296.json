    "description": "Powers Creek  \r\nTrail length:3km \r\nLevel: difficult with most  difficult options \r\nRating: 4/5\r\n\r\nAfter driving upCrystal Mountain road towards the ski area  just past Westbank.  At fork go right Jackpine Lake Road   look for the 3km marker.  The trail is about 500m further on the right.  You?ll know this is the one if you hit an 8 foot drop after 100m(there are alternate routes around everything).  This has some drops, log rides, launches, uphills and a whole lot of downhills.  You end up in a cul de sac that can be ridden downhill to the highway turnoff you took on the way up.",
