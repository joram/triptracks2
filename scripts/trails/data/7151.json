    "description": "The trail meanders on easy ground  through mixed forest until steepening suddenly. Here the trail splits. Left will take you on a very steep descent to the river below the falls (If you choose this, don't venture too close to the cliff faces - they are very unstable.)\r\rMuch more frequently traveled, the right fork continues down (past unstable cliff edges to the left... keep children and dogs in check here) and eventually emerges immediately above the falls. (Note: extreme caution should be exercised here, too, as the rocks are undercut, and can be extremely slippery as well. Play it safe! ...the dangers are not immediately apparent.",
    "directions": "The Muskeg Falls trail head is located 16 km. south of Grande Cache on the east side of Hwy 40. It is not signed, but the rest stop pull-out is perfectly situated. Park here.",
