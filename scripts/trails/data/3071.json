    "description": "The Millennium trail is a great little trail that parallels the Campbell River and on route passes the 25 meter Elk Falls.  Along the way you will pass beautiful big old trees, lots of greenery and a peaceful setting.  The entire route is about 5 kms and takes only a couple of hours depending on your walking pace.  The trail is well maintained, with board walks, stairs and bridges.  Just follow the well worn path and you cannot get lost.",
    "directions": "The trailhead is at the John Hart Generating Station off Highway 28. Once you get into the parking lot, look for the signs pointing you in the right direction. To get there head towards Gold River and about 10 minutes out of Campbell River you will see a sign on right for the generating station.",
