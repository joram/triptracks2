    "description": "Wapta Falls is a short hike to a set of spectacular falls that can be done year round. A great place to stop and stretch the legs while driving through the area. The approach to the falls is pleasant but uninspiring. The falls are amazing though and you can get right up to them if you don't mind getting a bit wet. The access road to the picnic area is closed in the winter adding a few km's. Great snowshoe if the trail isn't packed but chances are the snowshoes will not be required unless immediately after a snowfall due to the popularity of the trail. In the summer, this trail is usually extremely busy but you can drive the access road which cuts the distance in half.",
    "directions": "Parking is on the south side of the highway between Field and Golden along Highway 1 identified by a Parks Canada sign.",
