    "description": "Gray's and Torrey's mountains are two of Colorado's 14'ers; mountains \rwhich reach higher than 14,000 feet of elevation, with Gray's reaching \r14,270' and Torrey's Peak - 14,267'. Because of their close proximity (the \rtwo are separated only by a saddle), this pair are often scaled together, \rthough that is by no means necessary.\r\rThe Trail begins in a lush valley beneath the two mountains and gradually \rascends through a number of switchbacks to the summit of Grays before \rheading down the saddle to Torrey's summit. The view back into the \rvalley is stunning, and the views from both peaks are absolutely \rspectacular, being without a doubt the highest points in the area. \rWildflowers populate the lower reaches and hikers are treated to a \rserenade of Pika calls as they head upwards. \r\rDownhill ski enthusiasts have been known to ski down various of the \rslopes on the mountain.",
    "directions": "Take I70 west from Denver to the Bakerville exit (#221). Leave the highway \rand drive south over the overpass to the dirt parking area near the start of \rForest Road 189. This is the winter trailhead and, even if the upper road is \ropen, it is recommended for low-clearance passenger cars to park here. It?s \ralmost 5 Km from the winter trailhead to the summer trailhead. Reach a \rjunction after 1.5Km - stay straight and follow the sign for the Grays Peak \rtrailhead. Continue another 3 Km to the Summer trailhead at 11,280?. There \rare restrooms and a few camping spots near the parking area.\r\r",
