    "description": "Cheakamus Lake is a cold glacial fed lake surrounded by beautiful mountains.  The trail itself is relatively flat following the Cheakamus river to Cheakamus Lake (some elevation gain).  The trail rolls up and down, but it's not difficult at all -- unless of course you are on an Access Challenge as we were.  In Access Challenge (sponsored by B.C. Mobility Opportunity Society) teams of able bodied particpants and those in specially modified wheelchairs called trailriders work together to reach a destination.  BCMOS sponsors two or three multi-day access challenges per summer (See www.reachdisability.org/bcmos). They are true challenges, and, are very rewarding, and one heck of a workout.In this case, we drove up from Vancouver, almost to Whistler, and took the turnoff for Cheakamus lake on the right. You'll see the turnoff, which is also near the Whistler dump (you can smell it not see it if you get out of your car here). Proceed about 500m down the dirt road, and you will see another sign for Cheakamus Lake on the left, turn left up this road. We proceeded 7km along a logging road (well marked) to the trailhead.  From there we hiked the trail along the river to our designated camp spot.  There are many camp sites along the trail, along the lake or river, and, you'll find you are on the South side of the Whistler ski resort (although you can't see it -Snowboarders have been known to get lost down here).Great views, sunsets, and an overall enjoyable trail. Mountain bikes are allowed and this part of the trail is part of the famous Chekamus Challenge each September. It's not far from Whistler, so, cheak-it-out!Also note, on your return you can cross foot bridge at Helm Creek crossing, hike up as far as you want, return.Note: Distance above is for the round (return) trip.",
    "directions": "In any car, drive from Vancouver to Whistler. At the first light in Whistler, Function Junction, turn right on Cheekamus Road, go down the road maybe 1/2 km, then make a left on to the narrower road. (if you cross a bridge, you have gone too far). Drive another 5.5 km (approx) to the trail head.",
