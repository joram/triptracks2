    "description": "I was in this area to check out the coastline around Morden but I needed other things to explore to fill up the day.  This brook has supposedly a 15ft fall at its exit on the Bay of Fundy.  I made my way from the road through a mixed forest and then decided a somewhat steep slope down the ravine carved by the stream.   Made it all the way to the coast and the fall was a bit smaller than I expected...maybe 8ft or so.  However around the corner from it is a decent size sea cave!",
    "directions": "Make your way to Morden and turn on McNally Rd towards Victoria Harbour.  Turn on Augburger Rd and park mid point and head to the stream running east of the road.",
