    "description": "As you know I\u2019m always looking for waterfalls.  Sometimes I don\u2019t have enough time to get out of the city so I decided to check some possible climbing crags and a brook that flows into Cole Harbour.  The climbing crags were a series of waypoints taken on sat imagery.  From my track, the south rocks and path didn\u2019t amount to very much.\n\nThere was only little fall that only appears after rain at;   I decided to move north a little and follow a brook of about 2-3 ft in width.  Immediately I was impressed as the forest is super easy to navigate with little underbrush.  The brook looses some elevation towards the harbour and that gives rise to a few cascade type falls.  Just before the brook enters the harbour on the left (facing downstream) is actual a good size wall for bouldering opportunities (44.654, -63.439).",
    "directions": "Cole Harbour Rd.  Turn on Bissett Rd going towards Rainbow Heaven beach.  The small brook to follow downstream crosses that road at;  44.651, -63.438.",
