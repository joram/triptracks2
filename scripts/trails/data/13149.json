    "description": "So you don't hear this often...Stewiacke River and waterfall.  This river is mostly sluggish as it carves it way in the Stewiacke valley.  Of course some of its tributaries have well known falls such as Butcher Hill, Findlay, Sheepherder or McCullough Brook falls or more obscure like Scrub Grass or Black brook falls.I took a chance on this one.  The headwaters of the Stewiacke River is tiny as it crosses highway 289 on the way towards New Lairg from Brookfield.  Tiny as in about 2-3 feet across maximum.  anyways it starts from the highway with a few promising cascades of 1-2ft high nd after following the brook upstream for about 200m or so you will face a terminal fall of about 20ft!  This was a very pleasant surprise!",
    "directions": "Highway 289 to where the Stewiacke River crosses at; N45.39753 W62.83457.  This is about 3.5km south of the railroad crossing on highway 289.  Falls are approx at; N45.39834 W62.83803",
