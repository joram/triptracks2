    "description": "Possibly more of a walk than a hike, but should be considered a hike due to length.\rTotal distance of hike is 15 kms, total ascent 112 m, 4.5 to 5 hours\rBeach walk is very interesting, but long, due to obstacles, rocks, fallen trees and soft surface\rGo to Cape Alava first (this is actually the farthest west point on continental USA, farther west than Cape Flaterry), slightly more hilly, then south along the beach to Sandy Point, and back from Sandy Point to Ozette NP trailhead, as this route is flatter and a lot more boardwalk, ie, easier walk back after long quite arduous walk along the beach.\rGo to the Last Resort store after the hike and get an ice cream cone.\rClearly a 4/5, a wonderful day.\r",
    "directions": "2 routes from Port Angeles WA:\rBoth drives take approx 1:45 from Port Angeles, but longer route (140 kms), via Hways 101, 113 and 112 more pleasant, less winding. Shorter route (122 kms), via Hway 112, is very windy and becomes tedious after a while, and the views not much better.",
