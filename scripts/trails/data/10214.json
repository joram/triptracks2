    "description": "A very short little trail with some interpretive stations telling of the history of peoples in this area stretching back 11,000 years.\r\rNice place to stretch ones legs or go for a picnic and walk with the kids.\r\rNote: The 'bible' of MTB (Backcountry Biking in the Canadian Rockies by Doug Eastcott) calls a different trail Sibbald Flats, but all the Kananaskis Country maps call this one Sibbald Flat.  The other trail called 'Sibbald Flats' or Tom Snow North starts from the Dawson Rec area on the othr side of hiway 68.\r",
    "directions": "Head west of Calgary on Hiway 1 to the well marked Hiway 68 (Sibbald Creek Trail) exit (about 17.5km past hiway 22 overpass). \r\r\rDrive South/West along #68 for ~26km to the well marked Sibbald Lake Recreation Area. \r\r\rPark in the picnic/parking area to the left of the camping area.  Look for the trailhead marker in the parking lot.\r\r",
