    "description": "This trail follows an old overgrown logging road. It is 3 km in one direction with a steady vertical rise of 360 m. The trail starts and ends at Smallwood Creek Forest Service Road so it is possible to do this trail in the other direction.",
    "directions": "From the Taghum bridge (Nelson side--8km from the city) drive west for 5.3km. Turn right onto Beasley Road. At 0.6km right onto Queen Victoria Rd (unpaved). At 1.1km the road becomes Smallwood Creek Forest Service Rd. The trail head for the Smallwood trail system is at about km 2. The trail head for Sweet Sally is at about km 4.5. You can also continue along the road and start at the upper side of the trail.",
