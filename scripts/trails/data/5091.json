    "description": "An optional extension of the McPhail Creek Trail, this takes you right up to a very nice little alpine lake, complete with fishies & great views.  Be prepared for 400 climbing in about 2km.\r\rThis trail is near (but is 42km North and 100m higher than McPhail):",
    "directions": "SW of Calgary, 85km at a bearing of 215 degrees. You're looking for the Cat Creek Provincial Recreation Area (Equine). From the North, go W on #1 to Hi-way #40 and drive about 102km S, Cat'll be on your right. The Southern approach is to go W on #22X, then S on #22 until you get to Longview. Back up 300m and go W on 541 about 42km until you get to the Highwood Junction (#541, #40, and #Forestry Trunk Road). Keep going on the pavement back up North about 5.2km and you're at Cat Creek. Find a parking spot.\r\rTrail head starts at North end of parking loop, at end of equine uses parking area. Go around the locked gate and down the sorry excuse for a road (but a good example of a MTB path).\r\rNOTE: This section of hi-Way #40 (from the Highwood Junction up to Peter Lougheed Park) is closed from Dec 15 to June 15 (or there abouts) to let the Elk and the Sheep do their thang. It's probably too snowy or too much water flowing then anyways.\r",
