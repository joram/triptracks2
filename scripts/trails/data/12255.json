    "description": "This is a pleasant, easy ski tour located approximately one hour outside of Manning Park Resort.  A 25-30 degree slope provides fun but short runs that can easily be yo-yo'd.  Ascent out of the bowl is slightly tricky and there have been numerous reports (including times from myself) where navigation out was tricky without use of GPS.",
    "directions": "Access is from the Orange Chair at Manning Park Resort.  A $10 single lift backcountry pass is available and recommended.  Exit the Orange Chair skier's right (West).  Ride along Horseshoe Trail until a fork goes right (North); take the fork.  Keep an eye open for signs for the Poland Lake trail.  Follow these signs and follow the marked trail (orange tape is tied to trees in the winter time).  Please note that the attached GPS track includes the chairlift ride up and ride back to the parking lot in the resort.",
