    "description": "Fairy Creek trail follows Fairy Creek to a small waterfall. A newly cut trail leads up to the right at the trail head or you can follow a dirt road. The new trail and dirt road connect back together again and follow an older developed trail. The trail has moderate grades with a few switch backs that leads to a view point of the waterfall from a tributary creek above Fairy Creek. The trail does continue from this tributary creek but the tributary creek could not be safely crossed in spring due to snow pack. The trail is a 4 km round trip with an elevation gain of 120 m.\nThere is another trail that leads down to Fairy Creek and the waterfall from the view point but this trial is not developed. From the waterfall you can follow a rough trail down the creek that will eventually lead back to the main Fairy Creek Trail.",
    "directions": "The trail head is at the Fairy Creek Highway 3 bridge across the Elk River and a short distance northeast of downtown.",
