    "description": "The hike is tough, going straight uphill for a significant portion, with some ups and downs right before reaching the peak. The trailhead is a bit tricky to find. Head to the Lindeman Lake trailhead but before heading onto the main trail, take your first possible left (it looks almost like it leads nowhere) to head towards the river. With a tad bit of searching, you will find a log with wire and steps which resembles a path. Cross the log over the river then head left and the trail will be on your righthand side going straight up the slope. The trail is fairly well marked,  and you will quickly gain a lot of elevation in no time. The first views come a couple kms in of Lindeman Lake. Keep going though and the real fun begins. Eventually, you will have a vista overlooking both Lindeman and Greendrop, and eventually reach a ridge with 360 degree panorama views of both lakes along with Chilliwack Lake and the mountain range behind. This is a good turnaround point for anyone running out of time as it is still a ways to the top.Once you reach the ridge, keep going up and up, following the ridgeline to reach the peak.",
