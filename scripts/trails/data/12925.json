    "description": "This is a moderate hike starting at Old Buck Trail then following a clockwise route up to the crossover to Deep Cove, back along the Quarry Rock trail, through the village of Deep Cove then through a more developed area of suburbia to the starting point.  Just over 11 km and about 425 m elevation gain.Start up the Old Buck Trail for about 2-2.5 km and turn right at signs for Deep Cove, then after about 4.8 km from start of hike you should reach Quarry Rock, conspicuous by the number of visitors at any time of the year.  Follow the well worn path back to Deep Cove now heading back east.  If timing permits you might even stop in at the Seymour Art Gallery, combining recreation with culture.  Take any street heading back to east to Mt Seymour Parkway and head north back to Old Buck Trail.",
    "directions": "Old Buck Trail is off the Mount Seymour Road less than 1 km from Mt Seymour Parkway.  First, get over to the North Shore of Vancouver and find Mt Seymour Parkway heading east.  Turn left on My Seymour Parkway and after shopping center on left hand side, Old Buck Trail head is next turnoff on left.",
