A nice leisurely cruise, some moderate terrain (Cypress calls some of the trails diamonds) - any moderately fit person should have no real problem.\nSelf guided tours run from 9:30am to 4:30pm with rentals available on site if needed.",
    "directions": "Take the Cypress Bowl exit to the Cross Country ski area",
