    "description": "Easy little trail in the historic town of Greenwood.   A very interesting looking town and a nice walk after dinner.  It can be made as long or short as desired as it connects up to the TransCanadaTrail (Trail to 2010), Columbia & Western Railway, et al.",
    "directions": "At the South end of Greenwood, look for the old brick powerhouse.  Park near to it and the trail starts just behind it.\r\n\r\nGreenwood is on Hiway 3 (Crowsnest)between Grand Forks & Osoyoos.",
