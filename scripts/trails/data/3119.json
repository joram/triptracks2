    "description": "A long established trail from Sooke River road that is not used as frequently now. The trail leads through a section of the Sooke Wilderness Park that show cases large areas of ferns and some interesting cliff formations. The highlight, of course, is the destination of Grassy Lake. This pristine lake is excellent for swimming and is almost always devoid of other people. On July 7th the water was about 18 degrees celcius.",
    "directions": "We parked at the gates to the Sooke Potholes (make sure you park off the pavement). This is were the trail starts (N48 25.470 W123 42.807). Proceed uphill and cross the Galloping Goose (you can access the trail from the \"Goose\" as well). Here is a trail sign for the Equine bypass of the trestle (N48 25.594 W123 42.639). Continue to the NE until you come to the waterpipe that crosses the trail (N48 25.883 W123 42.145). The main trail continues to the N while the Harrison Trail is about 10-20m to the NE. The distance round trip is 10km.",
