    "description": "A 2km long trail that allows you to take a walk back in time.  Hosmer was settled in 1906 and by 1908 Hosmer Mines Ltd (a subsidiary of the CPR's Pacific Coal Company) was established.  Along this trail you will come across remnants of the powerhouse, compressor house, lamp house and, at the end of the trail, the tunnels themselves and the fan house that pushed fresh air into the mine tunnels.  The trail follows an old road and takes about 1 hour one way (not including exploring the structures).  Please respect the structures and remnants and be sure not to increase their rate of degradation by any of your activities.",
    "directions": "From Sparwood:Follow highway 3 towards Fernie.  At Hosmer, turn left directly after the Hosmer Hotel (if you cross the bridge you've gone too far).  Follow this road for 1km until you see a small gravel road on your right with a yellow gate.  Follow up this road for about 200 meters and you'll find a place to park up to 5 vehicles.  Start the trail from here.",
