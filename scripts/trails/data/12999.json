    "description": "This is an unofficial trail that locals used to get to a couple of waterfalls and swimming holes in the CBHNP.   Park at the Coastal trail parking at Neils Harbour.  Do not cross the road but head upstream along Halfway Book.  At the end of the parking, you will notice the ld trail.  Follow it as it ascends small hills towards the river.There is some deadfall in the way but nothing major.  The trail is not maintained.  At first you will get to the old bridge abutment.  The fall here is about 10ft with sheer rock walls on either sides.  Continue going upstream on Halfway Brook until you hit the final and largest fall and then trail ends as well.  The fall here is really unique.  It has a slider on one side of the river and on the other side (if enough water) it plunges a good 25ft into a large circular hole which is open on the downstream end.",
