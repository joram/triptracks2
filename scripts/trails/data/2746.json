    "description": "NTS Map: 092G14\r\nLumberjacks is a short flowy trail that heads west off Perth Drive in the Garibaldi Highlands.  It's a sweet way to connect up to Jack's trail on the way to Alice Lake, or you can do a loop around the highlands by heading south off the end of Lumberjacks onto Trestle trail, with numerous trails to choose from after that.\r\n\r\nTo get to Alice Lake, ride Lumberjacks to it's end, then right briefly onto the north end of Trestle Trail then left on the FSR. Jack's trail is the first obvious hiking trail starting less than a kilometre on your left. There's a sign about 150m into the trees. This will take you to Alice Lake\r\n\r\nLumberjack's has a brief technical down hill section, with lots of roots and small drops.  It's otherwise fast smooth flowing trail all the way to Alice Lake.  Enjoy!\r",
    "directions": "Turn off the hwy on east on Garibaldi Way, go left on Skyline Drive, following it through onto Braemar Dr, turn right on The Boulevard, then left onto Perth Drive, taking it all the way to the end. Just before the end on the left is the start of Lumberjacks trail.\r\n\r\nCurrent Conditions:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n      \t\r\n\r",
