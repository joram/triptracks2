    "description": "Edwards Rating: II (II) S SEasy scramble for a first hike in 2014, this is a great place to start as it's not too long, it's quiet and you still can manage to do some hands on scrambling depending on the trail you choose. It's annoying sometimes with some snow and 2-3 choices of paths very often. Stick to the ridge, on your right when going up, best suggestion I can provide. Otherwise, you may have to turn back down a bit when you'll see large-long slabs with few grips and exposure. On my GPS, I got 603 m net elevation in approx. 3 km to Door Jamb and 3.9 km with Net elevation of 722 m to Loder Peak.",
    "directions": "From Canmore, take 1A up to the cement plant, then park right out front of it. There's a \"parking\" by the trail head.",
