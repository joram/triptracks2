    "description": "AN easy hike in Wells Grey Park.  The Trail is wide and flat.  It leads to a high cliff overlooking Spahats Falls as it comes out of a narrow and deep canyon.  You can also see the Clearwater River.  There are guard fences, but be careful anyway.",
    "directions": "On the Clearwater Valley Road leading from Clearwater BC on the Yellowhead Highway into Wells Grey Park.  The trailhead is on the West side of the road, about 10km from the info place at the junction of the Clearwater Valley road and the Yellowhead Highway.  Get a free park map at the info place.",
