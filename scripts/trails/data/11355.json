    "description": "Done the Prairie Mountain Grunt?  You can come back down a different way, off the west side of the mountain and down to Prairie Creek.  Make it to the top of Prairie Mtn, then continue North for another 100ms, and look for a cairn on the West side of the mountain.  This is your signal to descend and follow the flagging in the trees.The scenery is beautiful and serene, and not very steep at all.  Prairie Creek will return you to your starting point for the Mountain climb!",
    "directions": "Take Highway 66 to where winter gates are closed.",
