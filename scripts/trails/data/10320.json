    "description": "This is an high alpine hike along several ledges with spectacular views of the surrounding lakes and mountains. The trail starts at Lake O'hara and is clearly marked as Wiwaxy trail. The trail climbs steeply to a saddle below Wiwaxy peak and turns left to traverse some spectacular ledges reaching Lake Oesa. From Oesa there are numerous high alpine ledges and boulder fields to navigate through to reach the Opabin Plateau and make a forested decent back to Lake O'Hara. The trail is marked consistently with a blue and yellow number 11 painted on rocks and boulders throughout the trail. \nBeware it can be difficult  to see the markings when traversing boulder fields.",
    "directions": "The parking area is just 10-15 minutes by car from Lake Louise and is clearly signed on highway 1. You must either hike the 12 Kms to Lake O'Hara or book a bus. The bus has to be reserved three months ahead or you can take a chance and hope there is room on the bus.",
