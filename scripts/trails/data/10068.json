    "description": "Great trail took my 3.5 year olds and my 21 month old . . . was a good time!!  Next time we will avoid going up while there is so much snow on the trail, it made it harder for the kids . . . but they managed to get to the top and enjoy the picnic!!  (We went end of April)",
    "directions": "Go through Canmore, along Main Street and head towards the Nordic Centre.  Pass the Nordic Centre, then you will see a sign to direct you to Grassi Lakes parking lot.",
