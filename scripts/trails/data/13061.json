    "description": "A really fun trail just off of the \"official\" path. A very narrow dirt path with lots of natural features; trees and other various flora encroaching on either side - the entire trail is along the Red River and there are a few sections where the trees open up and you have a great view right on the edge of the river.There are some decent technical parts and flowy fast sections, too. I was really surprised at how the trail rode. The end of the trail goes right into a well-paved downhill section (perfect for sprinting!) under the Norwood Bridge right into The ForksI could see this trail being a bit treacherous during the wetter parts of the year just because you're riding the edge of the riverbank, but so far as trails inside the city go I'd consider this  hidden gem to be one of my favorites!*NOTE: I've found that this trail is much friendlier going TO The Forks versus coming FROM*",
    "directions": "Heading East on Jubilee, take a right at the first set of lights after the Bridge Drive-In (Cockburn St S), you're there!",
