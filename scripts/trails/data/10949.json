    "description": "A short hike just outside of Digby to an impressive waterfall.Digby County does not offer a lot of waterfalls but this is a nice little hidden gem just outside of Digby.  Setting off from the road, it?s a bushwack down the side of the stream towards the seashore.  Start off in the deciduous forest by the north side of the brook, you quickly enter a mixed forest.  You can either stay on the side of the brook where you will need to go across a few times or you can just power your way through the forest towards the coastline.  It?s only in the last one hundred metres or so of the brook that you will see three distinct waterfalls.  The first two are smallish but the last one is an impressive sight.  Although it doesn?t fall straight down to the seashore it cascades a good one hundred feet or more.  Climb back up to the start or follow the coastline of the Digby gut towards the lighthouse at Point Prim!",
    "directions": "In Digby, take lighthouse Rd and park at intersection of Lighthouse Rd and Bay View shore Rd.  follow the brook at this intersection towards Digby Gut",
