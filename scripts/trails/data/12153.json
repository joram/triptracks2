    "description": "On the mighty (for NS) Lahave river are a couple of points I always wanted to hike to; Darr and Frideaux Falls.   The hike is super easy and the beginning looks like a well know hang-out spot.  then it's a matter of following the river upstream, over some large rocks and then the falls come into view!Spoiler alert; the falls are never more than 2ft high but the amount of water and the constriction of the rock walls on either side makes this place worthwhile to visit nonetheless",
    "directions": "Lower Branch Rd.  Turn on Forest View Drive and drive to the end of the cul de sac and then continue on the dirt road to a well designated trail on the left.",
