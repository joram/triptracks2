    "description": "I was looking for a stream with a potential for a fall in the Creignish Mountains near Judie.  chisel drool look like it offered enough elevation ;loss in one particular area that there could be a fall.I drove up a well maintained dirt road until an ATV trail to the right of the road appeared.  To save some time, I man biked that road as it went down a small hill, sweet through some muddy puddles and then came up slightly.  Before the ATV trail ended I entered the wood and made a b-line for the brook about 600m away.   This area was pretty much level with large areas that were covered by alders and rose bushes!!!!Soon I was on the lip of the brook and descended into a small hemlock ravine...no falls here!  I decided to follow it up for another 700m or so as the topography looked more promising.  Sure enough soon there were more cascade type falls on the brook and a fear a couple of bends, I was in front of the  small plunge fall of about 10feet.  Above the fall, there are two more small cascades.I was pressed for time so I didn't go further but I am willing to bet that there is the potential for a larger fall a little bit more upstream.  Please lt me know if this is the case!",
