    "description": "A shorty but a goody.  Just off highway 103 lies two picturesque waterfalls amidst a grove of pine trees.  I set off through the woods with some mild bushwacking involved.  After a minute or so I went up a fairly large hill that had lots of boulders that were covered by moss......these are good places to break an ankle for sure.  The river is just passed the hill and I started to go downstream.  When I looked upstream I saw one of the falls so I turned around.  I finally found a trail that lead to two main waterfalls with a few more rapids in between.  The trail leads back to the highway so no need to bushwack as I came put right beside the sign indicating the distance to Hubbards and Halifax",
    "directions": "Highway 103 towards Chester.  The highway crosses Canaan River right before exit 7.",
