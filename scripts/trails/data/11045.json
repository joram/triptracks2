    "description": "The hike is a short one and if you park close to the latitude/ longitude I give you below you should be able to find an unofficial trail used by locals to get to this special spot.  Otherwise you can do like me and try to find a spot to get across the logged area towards the river (the north running track).  The bushwacking option is not pleasant as the area was logged not long ago and is overrun with raspberry and blackberry and other thorny bushes.  The North river at this point has carved out a gorge through some softer stone and has created a couple of waterfalls and swimming holes.  The cliffs are high enough to afford you some shade in the summer so it?s likely well used in the height of the summer.  There are still some mature evergreen close to the top of the cliffs that give you an idea of what the forest used to look like.",
    "directions": "In upper Onslow (near Truro), turn on North River- West road and drive until  45\u00b0 30.676'N, 63\u00b0 15.991'W.",
