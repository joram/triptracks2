    "description": "I had forgotten to put this series of fall on trailpeak.  The brook falls over 100ft in a very short time.  The brook is also small so only go when the water is way up.  To get to it, cross the farmers field heading towards the hill and Gavin Brook.  There are lots of conifers near the brook so it should be easy to spot.  then just bushwack your way up to see all the falls.",
    "directions": "Gavin Brook crosses the Prospect Rd at  45.427619\u00b0, -64.305203\u00b0",
