    "description": "With reconstruction of many of the ski slopes at Cypress for the 2010 Olympic Games, portions of the Baden Powell trail from the Cypress downhill parking lot to Eagle Bluffs, overlooking English Bay and the Strait of Georgia, have been re-routed.The BP trail now heads west between the Black Mtn and Mt Strachan chair lifts and then heads south, up to Cabin Lake, then Black Mtn and then on to Eagle Bluffs.The new portion from the chairlifts up towards Cabin Lake is quite steep, and being new, very rocky. Hopefully the surface will be improved as it is completed. Whether this new trail is better than the old one remains to be seen.In fact, we headed up the old trail, by the Ski Rentals cabin, and only discovered the new trail on the way back, coming down from Cabin Lake. Attached is the GPS data for the trail as we travelled it on July 28, 2007. It could yet change before it is finalized.",
    "directions": "From the Upper Levels Highway (Trans Canada Highway # 1) westbound in West Vancouver, take the exit to Cypress Provincial Park and travel up the paved road 15 kms to the DOWNHILL shi area.",
