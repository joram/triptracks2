    "description": "Vernon River is a stretch of brackish water that flows from above Cherry Valley through to the Northumberland Strait. It is a tidal zone, so refer to a tide chart before setting on your way. Fighting the current in shallow water isn't my idea of fun, so again, pick the trip based on tides. In the spring and at a high tide, you will be able to reach further than I was able to on my afternoon trip.\r\n\r\nWhat attracted me to this route is the flat, then rolling topography. The river is bordered by farms and salt flats. I have indicated some potential camping spots, but this is private land, so leave no trace.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to extend this trip by leaving the river and paddling out to open water for longer adventures.\r\n\r",
    "directions": "\r\n20 minutes from Charlottetown toward Wood Island ferry on the Route 1. Vernon River bridge has parking and launch facilities on both sides.",
