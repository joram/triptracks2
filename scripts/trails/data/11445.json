    "description": "Just a couple of hundred metres from highway 102 lies a couple of wetlands which have two stacked loops of crushed gravel trails.  The vegetation and wildlife are typical of wetlands with lots of birds to spot and a family of beavers.  Great place to stretch your legs on a trip out of the city.",
    "directions": "Highway 102.  Exit 12 to Brookfield.  Turn towards Brookfield and turn right into parking lot by the wetlands",
