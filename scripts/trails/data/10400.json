Starting at the Peter Lougheed Visitor Centre/Lodge the Canyon Trail is a dedicated snowshoe trail that leads to the Lower Kananaskis Lake Dam and then you will see to your right the ice sculptures created by the penstock. The Penstock built in 1955 is a wooden structure that drive water to the Kananaskis Powerhouse located at the far end of the ice sculptures portion of the trail. The ice sculptures are huge beautiful formations created by water spouts which are evident along the penstock.",
    "directions": "Drive west on Highway 1 to the exit on to Highway 40 south. Travel 50 kms to the Kananaskis Lakes Road and follow it another 5 kms to the Peter Lougheed Visitor Centre. The centre is a great place to relax, use facilities and make yourself a cup of tea to sit beside a super huge fireplace overlooking the surrounding meadows and mountains.",
