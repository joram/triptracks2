    "description": "Approximately 10 square kilometers right in the middle of NW Calgary.  Great for short trips or when K-co is still full of snow.  With nearly 100m of elevation change, this can be as challenging as you want to make it.  Up & Down & Up & Down or once up to the top and ride around.  Days, nights, I've done it all there and been happy I did it.\nWith a bit of exploring, there is some pretty cool singletrack and a couple of ravines.  Some moderately technical areas, but it will be known more for its cardio abilities.",
    "directions": "NW Calgary, John Laurie Boulevard and 14 ST NW and going N and W from there.  Several parking lots N along 14 St and one at John Laurie and Brisbois Drive and one at Shaganappi Trail & Edgemont Boulevard.",
