    "description": "Another reason to be grateful to the local mountain bike community - a really pleasant up & down loop through mossy second-growth forest, with occasional outcroppings / viewpoints.Head straight ahead on the logging road, up & to the right - watch for a trail up to the left about 1/2 km. from the gate and take it to do the loop clockwise (& pile on the elevation more quickly).  Climb the trail (\"Pity the Fool\"), turn left at the trail intersection and follow \"Stub\" up to Davis Lake Main.  Turn right up the road, then left on \"Grub\" almost right away.  Carry on up to the top of the ridge - you'll eventually come to a trail intersection with rocks across the trail and an \"Upper Queso\" sign on a tree. Turn right (left will take you to Hamilton Lk.) and follow the trail back down to Davis Lake Main.  Pick up the trail across the road and basically follow it through a series of mossy promontories back to your car.To go counter-clockwise just carry on up the old road until you reach the exit (right) to the Comox Lake viewpoint; follow the trail from the back of the viewpoint.",
    "directions": "From Cumberland drive towards Comox Lake and look for a yellow gate on the left about 400 meters after you cross Perseverance Creek.",
