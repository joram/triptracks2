    "description": "Distance of 9.6km is round trip.  This is a very steep, unrelentless 4.8 km ascent through the forest. The trail is very well marked and in good shape.  The last section features breathtaking of Wedgemount Lake and its glacier to the East, and the mountains to the west.  There is a refuge by the lake where you can take shelter or even spend the night.",
    "directions": "Drive north to Whistler, and continue on Highway 99 towards Pemberton some 10km. After driving around Green Lake you will see the park entrance to the right.  Drive to the parking lot some 2km up a well maintained (at least in late 2008) to the parking lot.",
