    "description": "The name of Jack Pine is clearly indicated on the map. The Jack Pine trail network is located in the Stony Swamp conservation area. It is a network located between Moodie Drive, West Hunt Club and the Highway 416. It is a network which is not part of the Stony Swamp Trail network, neither part of the North Loops Trail Network.\r\nIt is a separate network. You can access Jack Pine network by P11 and P9 parking well identified. Trail 26 is indicated on the map. But the map is outdated. There are more trails inside of this network and many connections. You can be lost if you are not familiar with this network. There are trails that needs to be marked  for sure. There are 2 sections inside of the Jack Pine Trail Network. The first one is called the South Loop 4KM and the true Jack Pine network is called the Nature Loop 2 KM. Thre is a lake being shown close to the South Loop and The Log Farm (Historical Interpretation) is not far.",
