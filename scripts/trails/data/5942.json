    "description": "The trail begins following a gravel trail for a short time before going into the forest for a bit.  The toughest climb is the middle part, and it gets to a gentle climb as it get closer to the top.  There are some switchbacks on the way up.  The views obviously get better too.  Try not to fall off.  Because part of the trail crosses private land, only hiking is allowed.  Apparently the trail also is closed from early Nov. to early April, although im not certain about that.",
    "directions": "The park is 5 km north of Enderby.  Get off the highway and onto Mabel Lake road and follow it for 2km.  Turn left on Brash-Allen and follow it until you reach a white fence.  There is a hydro pole with a hiker sign on it that clearly points the way to the trail.",
