    "description": "While following the walking trails closer to the falls, listen to its impending roar and gaze at the breath-taking scenery. Two suspension bridges take people over the falls and rapids, allowing them to feel the cool mist of the water?s fury.The name Weskusko (English translation = sweet grass or herb) was given to the lake by the native people. In their wake, along the Grass River, explorer, trader, voyager, trapper and prospectorfollowed. An early visitor was the eminent explorer, Samuel Hearne who crossed the old portage onJuly 20, 1774. Returning from Cumberland House to Hudson Bay the following year, Hearne and hismen arrived at ?We-Kus-qua? Lake on June 7th. The wind was blowing too hard to cross and theyput up for the night. Gold was discovered on the east side of the lake in 1914, and in 1917high-grade ore was shipped to British Columbia. Mining camps sprung up and the settlement of Herb Lake came into being.",
