    "description": "The area has many km of trail, this last winter we did well over a 100km. just to keep in shape for summer hiking .  Snowshoe'd every weekend from Dec 2015/2016 April 02 winter. The well tracked trails get packed down pretty fast  but after a good snow fall it?s like no one was there . But there is lots to explore and bust new trails through the trees.  This year the snow was excellent  and deep. There are areas of great difficulty and caution should be taken pack like you are spending the night or two just in case. We helped a number of people out late in the day through the season. The gps track uploaded is one  of many and is the last one of 2016 we went all the way to Silver Sttar Ski area sneaked down a run that was not used as the snow conditions were late season. An ipad mini with GIS kit and google imagery really helped give a sense terrain and location also pick clearings.",
