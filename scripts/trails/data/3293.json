    "description": "Sundance Canyon is a popular, classic, touristy trail staring from the Cave and Basin parking lot in Banff.  It looks like it's been around for a while (one sign was only in (gasp!) miles).  You can bike ride the first 4km and there are racks to lock your bikes to at this point.The first 4km is a walk down a paved trail with all of 20m elevation gain.  The first 2.5-3km of which is shared with horsies.  Wall to wall (or more accurately nose-to-tail) horses.  Several of them are toilet trained.  So far so good, great walk for anyone athletic or not, it is also wheelchair accessible.The next 2.5km get interesting.  It is a loop that crosses over the stream and returns down the other side of the canyon.  Up you climb through a very scenic and narrow canyon that you share with a stream.  Sundance Creek I'm guessing.  You gain about 150m of elevation on a steep, narrow and fun path.  There are some spectacular views from the top.You return to the parking lot via the same 4km paved path.  If you have packed your roller blades or skateboard, time to mount up.Great walk with or without the challenging loop at the end.Great walk, everyone made it out in one piece to enjoy a cold beer in the warm sunshine on the deck of the Banff Rose & Crown.This trail starts at:",
    "directions": "Banff, Alberta.  Drive to the South/West end of Banff Avenue, cross the bridge, turn right, drive 1km to the Cave and Basin Parking lot.  Trail starts just to the right side of the entry building (where you can find lattes and washrooms (not necessarily in that order)) as you walk towards it.  You do not have to pay / enter the Cave & Basin itself.",
