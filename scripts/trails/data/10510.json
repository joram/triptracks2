    "description": "A good trail up onto a granite ridge in Killarney Provincial Park over looking Lake of the Woods. The trail climbs quickly to a ridge and then follows the ridge the length of Lake of the woods. The trail gives a good view of Silver peak when you are on the ridge",
    "directions": "From Sudbury take Highway 69 South towards Toronto. After about 40 mins turn right onto the 637 to Killarney. Follow this road all the way into the Provincial Park (it seems to take forever, it's a long road). Stop at the George Lake Park Info Centre, and get your day pass. Re-trace your steps back towards Sudbury on the 637 and  turn left on to the Bell Lake road. Follow Bell Lake Rd about 7.5 Km to the trailhead.",
