    "description": "I have always wanted to check out this brook ever since  I saw Faribault?s 1893 map of the area showing a 40ft fall.  I used the dirt road on the west side of the river to gain access to the river and fall.  I had misjudged the gps coordinated and ended up bushwacking too upstream in a flat area.  I couldn?t believe there would be a 40ft fall anywhere there.   I then followed the brook downstream for a few hundred metres and saw my first two drops of about 6ft each.  Then the river went through a narrow gorge like setting and disappeared!   I made my way around the gorge and to the base of a wonderful fall.  Yep its easily 40ft and a beauty!   There is a massive rock wall on the west side and numerous large boulders at the base of the fall.  Getting back to the dirt road was surprisingly easy and through a mature hardwood forest.  The slope towards the fall is actually not too steep so it?s a good hike for just about anybody.",
    "directions": "Highway 316 in Country Harbour.  A pretty good dirt road starts at N45.24925\u00b0 W61.80462\u00b0 and continues until your GPS will point you to the fall.",
