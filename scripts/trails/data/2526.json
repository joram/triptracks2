    "description": "NTS Map: 082O03A continuation of the Barrier Lake Hike. Instead of returning the same way, we headed down Jewell Pass. This was a beatiful trip down the mountain through a forested area. It was a hot day, so the trees provided great shade. At the bottom, we had a choice of taking the Stoney Trail (which is a bit higher than the trail we took) that following the Power Line and hugged Barrier Lake. The scenery from the Fire Lookout was awesome. Highly recommended!",
    "directions": "Parking area west off Highway 40 at Barrier dam, north end of Barrier Lake.Head across the dam at north end of Barrier Lake, turn right at Y junction. Keep right at T junction, then immediately turn left onto old Lookout Access road. Begin a steady ascent. It's over 600 meters up.",
