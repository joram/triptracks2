    "description": "As I was waiting for the ferry on Long Island to bring me back to Digby Neck, I noticed some high bluffs to the north.  I set off from the metal gate across Boars Head Rd and immediately climb a good size hill.  At the top there is a trail to the right.  It leads to a beautiful bluff overlooking the Petit Passage below.The path continues but becomes overgrown with alders.  I finally reach the initial road I was hiking on (Boars Head).  It ultimately leads to a lighthouse located on a bluff.  the cliffs to the south of the bluff would be suitable for climbing.  also near the first lookof and on either side of Boars Head rd are located some very climbable boulders!",
    "directions": "In Tiverton, where you wait for the ferry, continue straight on Boars Head Rd",
