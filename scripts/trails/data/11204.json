    "description": "Hike up to Wedgemount Lake and from there up to Mt. Cook. The lake itself can be quite crowded, but Mt. Cook is typically empty. The way up is tedious and includes 2 hours on a loose boulder slope. However, the views at the top are rewarding, including on Wedgemount Glacier, Weart Glacier and Armchair Glacier. This is rather long for a day trip, so I suggest camping at the lake.",
    "directions": "Take the right turn 13 miles North of Whistler to the \"Wedgemount\" trailhead. There's a big parking, accessible by most 2WD (tried it in August 2013).",
