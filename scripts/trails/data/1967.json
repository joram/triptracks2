    "description": "This trail follows the Epinette Creek in Spruce Woods Provincial Park.  A series of connected loop trails that take the traveller up and down across rolling aspen parkland and into the creek bed.  This formation was once a large delta of the Assiniboine River after the last ice age and is characterized by sand dunes unique to the region.  Four emergency use cabins with wood stove make excellent day use sites and are placed at intervals of 2km (cabin 2) 6 kilometers (cabin 3) and 20km (cabin 4) which ends at Jackfish Lake, an oxbow lake just north of the Assiniboine River.  Of these cabin 3 offers fine views of the epinette creek and makes a great day trip destination all year long.  Cross country trails are well groomed throughout the season.  Crocuses in spring are abundant along with other wildflowers throughout the spring and summer.  Water available from creek year round and at cabins in summer (must be treated). Trailhead at N 49\u00b0 43.764 W 099\u00b0 17.472",
    "directions": "42 km east of Brandon, Park entrance is 19 km south of Trans-Canada on Highway 5 past town of Carberry.  Epinette Creek trail system entrance is well marked from the road. Telephone and trail info at trailhead.",
