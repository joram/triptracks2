    "description": "How can you truly describe a provincial icon.  Peggy's Cove has always drawn a high number of tourists for it's lighthouse and small fishing village.  However , it's worthwhile trip  to continue walking on the granite outcrops  due east of the lighthouse.   It's easy enough to walk and the views just keep getting better and better as you loose over 99% of the people who don't step far off the beaten path.  Lots of smaller boulders for the kids to climb or crawl under.  You end up walking about 1.5km to an area where a brackish lagoon cuts off the area from the area going towards Polly's cove (which in my mind is an even better destination).",
