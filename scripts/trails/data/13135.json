    "description": "I don't get to find too many new waterfalls in Annapolis County.  I followed a hunch I had on this tributary to the Moose River and was pleasantly surprised.  From Guinea Rd, try to follow an old and overgrown logging road. Veer to the right after about 350m and find Hennessy Brook.  It is a smaller brook but it carves some nice waterfalls on the way down a steep slide evergreen covered slope.  It has two major drops and countless smaller drops.",
