    "description": "A fairly easy snowshoe or hike on Fairmont Ski Hill at Fairmont Hot Springs, BC, through forest of slim spruce and some pine (see photos). Approx 200 m elevation gain.\r\rStart at the south end of the upper parking lot, head east along the left (north) edge of the ski run, and catch the trail on the left approx 160 m from your start (see GPS data). A few turns, on and off roads and trail, so follow the map or GPS data.\r\rOn Feb 23, 2010, we set off on YakTrax (without our snowshoes). After 2.8 kms, snow got too soft and deep to continue, so had to return. Will have to try this trail another time with snowshoes or in summer on foot to proceed further on this trail and try to find the end.",
    "directions": "From Hwy 93/95 at Fairmont Resort Rd in Fairmont Hot Springs, drive east on Fairmont Resort Rd all the way up to Fairmont Hot Springs Ski Hill (turn left at the campground), and drive right up to the far (south) end of the upper parking lot.",
