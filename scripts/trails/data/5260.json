    "description": "Trail to a stunning viewpoint at the top of Buntzen Ridge. \nFrom the trailhead proceed up steps and follow trail to where it intercepts with cut line running from Sasamat lake to Buntzen Lake. Remnants of the old water pipe which used to from Buntzen Lake to the Burrard thermal are visible. From here an exceptionally well-groomed trail takes you up to an old access road that continues up to the Buntzen ridge saddle. On the left is the trial to Diez Vistas. It proceeds up to the summit of Buntzen ridge. Portions of the ascent are quite steep. Various routes have been established and at times the trail may seem indistinct, but the most heavily travelled route is usually visible and should be followed. At the top of the ridge the trail to the left takes you to a number of viewpoints en route to Buntzen Lake. The trail to the  right takes you to Puente del Estes--a beautiful viewpoint and a great place to relax before the return trip. \nThe trail is 6.8 k return. Total elevation gain, including the ups and downs, is 2630 feet. Editor's note:  Cumulative elevation gain by looking at elevation plot suggests more like 1500' total climbing.",
    "directions": "Park in Lot F at White Pine beach and take the stairs north to the trail head.",
