    "description": "NTS Maps: 082O04Elevation gain 1,015 m (3,330 ft).To get this trail travellers must first get to the Healy Creek trail either from the Sunshine Road access or the Cave and Basin access. The Brewster Creek trail begins as a level, dirt double track trail that gradually climbs up Brewster Creek Valley to Sundance Lodge (service for registered guests only). The 30km return trip from the Cave and Basin to the lodge makes for a good day mountain bike ride. Trail users then have the choice to continue up the rugged and often muddy valley. Those who choose to continue up the valley should be prepared for wilderness conditions.",
