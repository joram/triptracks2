    "description": "The P2 NCC Greenbelt loop in Ottawa is a fantastic little ski on the outskirts of town, and should be part of everyone's anti-boredom list for winter.  If you live in the west end of Ottawa, you've got several loops in the Greenbelt, which taken together, give you some great variety and a ski workout that can be had without having to drive to Quebec.\nParking at the P2 lot just off Carling, you ski one giant loop, with minimal elevation gain.  A few small dips to make it interesting.  If you proceed north initially, you'll be travelling through a mixed forest which skirts the Grandview drive homes, visible on your right.  Once you reach the river, you have some big trees and some nice terrain with the option to ski out onto the river (see the pic attached).  Continuing along, you will see a farm house and this is the farmland whose surrounding forest you are skiing through.  It's a very pleasant ski and the best part is that for many it's only 10 minutes from home so why not.\nOn your return, you ski through a very pretty pine stand, and, before long you are back at P2.  Ideal for families and those out for a casual ski.",
    "directions": "Take the Moodie exit off the #417, and, drive north to the Carling Avenue, passing the now virtually extinct nortel campus (I used to work there!!! But so did everyone else in Ottawa it seems, ah the Christmas parties).\nAt Carling, turn left, and just a few hundred meters (West) you'll see the P2 lot on your right, amid some tall pines.  There is a sign on Carling indicating P2.  It's right off Carling, and still opposite the nortel campus on the north side.\nNote: It is possible to connect with the ski trails off P3 (Corkstown) by crossing Carling andfollowing NCC bike paths.  However, any connectors would be ungroomed and we leave that challenge for the more intrepid.",
