    "description": "Rouge Park is on the eastern edge of the GTA.  There are several trails in the park, some along the Rouge river and others climb up the ridge.  It's easy to spend a few hours or even a day exploring the network of trails.  Bring a picnic lunch and forget about the city for a while.  There is a campground here if you want to stay for the weekend.  I found it to be a pleasant distraction from the hustle and bustle of the city.",
    "directions": "Rouge park is in the Rouge valley north of the 401 on hwy2 (Kingston rd.) between Port Union rd. and Altona.",
