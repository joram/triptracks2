    "description": "Most people know Peggy's Cove for the smooth rocks, big waves and scenic lighthouse. If you want an equally scenic atlantic coastal hike experience without the crowds and the lighthouse, try Polly's Cove. Its just two kilometers east along Rte.333 and is not very well known, except to locals. \r\n\r\nThere are a number of footpaths criss-crossing the rocks and bogs between the road and the ocean. Keep a look out for the minke whales and carnivorous pitcher plants. And please stay on paths since the vegetation can be delicate!\r\n\r",
    "directions": "From Halifax, take the 333 to Peggy's Cove. Once you have checked out the lighthouse, backtrack 1.5km and look for the small parking spot on the south side of the road about halfway between the Peggy's Cove turnoff and the West Dover baseball diamond.",
