    "description": "Jim's Jungle is a fun little mountain bike trail on Burnaby Mountain, below SFU.  It has a few rooty sections, and other moderate technical bits, but is a great trail to work your skills.\nEnter the trail at the power lines.  The trail flows gently down hill, until it loops back to the power lines.  Cross to the forest on the other side, where the trail re-enters the forest.\nFollow the trail through to the intersection.  Going left is steep and technical.  Riding right will get you to North Road.  Ride left up the hill on North Road back to your car.\nAlternatively, from your car you can ride past the information board.  Near the small building on your left, you can drop down some steep trail to the intersection, then turn right and follow Jim's Jungle back the other way.",
    "directions": "Heading off Hwy 1 at Gagliardi Way, turn right at Broadway, then left at North Road.  At the top of the hill, before the road narrows, park at the obvious spot on your left.\nRide down the wide gravel path, past the information board.  You'll find the entrance on your left at the power lines.",
