    "description": "This climb follows the original scramble route on the East slope of Mount Norquay, which was the only route before the current Via Ferrata route was put in place.I have rated this trip as Moderate because Scrambling is not listed as an activity. It could be rated as an Easy Rock Climb, or as a Difficult Hike.The route overlaps a Via Ferrata route, so please respectfully discuss your plans with the Official Climbing Guides working in the area. Alternatively, sign up for one of their 3 Via Ferrata trips or simply enjoy the views from the top of the North American Chairlift and maybe some refreshments in the Cliffhouse Bistro.",
    "directions": "Take the summer chairlift to the top of Mount Norquay Ski Resort near Banff.",
