    "description": "Oliver mountain has a number of trails and is easily accessible. Most of the trails climb up hill. In 3 km I gained about 360 meters of elevation.\r\rThere are great views of the Okanagan Valley and you can get high enough to see the Fairview Whitelake road.\r\rIt's significantly cooler at the top with more wind than down in the valley.\r\rThis is desert country so on hot day bring water, and beware it's also rattle snake country.\r\rIn May wildflowers abound.",
    "directions": "In Oliver off 107th street between 360 and 362 avenues.",
