    "description": "A section of the Kettle Valley Railway (now trail) which is portion of the Trans Canada Trail - Boundary section.\nGPS data starts about 5 east of Grand Forks. The trail does not actually enter Christina Lake Village, to get into the village one needs to use a small section of road. The rail trail continues along the side of the mountain to Nelson.\nIt's a pleasant ride on the KVR, with a sandy section or two. Some good scenery which you won't see from the highway, it includes at least one relatively long bridge and view of a waterfall.\nThe downhill direction is eastward from Grand Forks to Christina Lake.",
    "directions": "From Grand Forks the are a number of kiosks for the Trans Canada trail, any one of them provide trail access.",
