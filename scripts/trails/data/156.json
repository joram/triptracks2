    "description": "NTS Map:92F2.  This linear trail is located along the east side of the Alberni Valley. The trail, an old logging grade, runs 20km north of Highway 4 through second-growth forest. The south section goes about 3km south. The length of the north section makes it ideal for biking and horseback riding. The north section passes through rural residential and farming areas. It includes occasional panoramic views across the valley. Along the way are the McLean Mill National Historic Site, Mulcaster Slough and the site of an old logging camp called Bainbridge Mill.",
