    "description": "Wow, the first trail in Regina.  This is an urban ride and we're usually not big on these but ya' gotta start somewhere.  For tourists to Regina, this is a good start.After an extensive beautyfication eh, Wascana Lake in the heart of Regina is open for business.  If you want to canoe, kayak, chase Canada Geese, or go for a stroll or an urban ride you can do it all here.  Loops from 2 to 25 km are possible and all within walking distance from downtown hotels.",
    "directions": "From Albert Street, Broad Street or the Hiway #1 Bypass on the east side, there is access everywhere.  An easy way is to look for the Provincial Legislature building just South of Downtown and park somewhere close to that.",
