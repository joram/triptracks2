    "description": "NTS Map: 082H04Elevation Gain: 240m (787 ft). This trail in Waterton Lakes National Park is the most popular short hike in probably all of the mountain parks. It's also the steepest, climbing 240m in just over 1km. The trail swithbacks up Mount Crandell to a prominent outcropping reminiscent of the grizzly's hump. The views of the Prince of Wales hotel, the townsite and down the length of Waterton Lake are spectacular. It is usually windy on the hump, so dress accordingly. Keep small children away from the edge and don't allow them to throw rocks over the edge - climbers sometimes like to scale the face.If you're one who likes to count switchbacks to know how close you're getting to the end - there's 18!!! Some are very close together but that's how steep it is. Just take your time and you'll get there.Return the same way.In winter please check the local avalanche conditions.",
