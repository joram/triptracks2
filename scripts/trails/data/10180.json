    "description": "The three trails forms this loop. The loop is well groomed, mostly flat and is good for beginners. Because the loop is just beside the town, it is a busy XC ski route in winter. The mountain view is spectacular.besides the loop, skiers can also XC ski across the famous lake and go further to six glacier trail. Of course, that is not groomed and there are only skier made tracks.",
    "directions": "From Calgary drive Hwy #1 west to the Lake Louise turnoff. Turn left, across the highway overpass and follow the signs to the Chateau Lake Louise. Approximately 1 km before reaching the Chateau, turn left onto the Moraine Lake road. The parking area is immediately ahead.",
