    "description": "This is a nice hike that starts on an ate trail...the ate trail eventually ends up on High Head...a lookout overlooking the north side of the Wentworth Hills.  There is a separate trailpeak post on it although it seems to have a trailhead being a private property so this might be easier to follow.The trail is a bit muddy at first and there are a few abandoned vehicles but then you enter a very pretty hemlock grove.  After the grove you get by a small cabin where Totten Brook flows.  Leave the ATV trail and basically follow Totten Brook upstream..after a few hundred feet, the valley becomes filled with gorgeous mature hardwood trees.  Eventually you come up to a small brook on the left side of the valley (looking upstream).  Follow it up for a few drops from 6-12 ft in height and then at the end of it you will see some cool cliffs.  Get to the top of them and have a look over the whole of Totten Brook Valley!",
