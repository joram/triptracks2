    "description": "A lot of forested switchbacks to the top,  then a sweet ridge walk to the \"cap\".  Not too savage a climb, but it doesn't stop until the top.  Pack a lunch or even a tent and make a longer trip out of it.There is a new trailhead staging area due to the old trail running through private property - follow the signs on Shunda road to get there.  This has shortened the hike to 6.5k one way or 13k round trip.  There are trail maps at the staging area.",
    "directions": "Going west from Rocky Mountain House down Hwy. 11 and take the turn off just across from the Nordegg town access (Shunda Road).  Follow the signs for the Coliseum trail as they have changed the trailhead staging area due to the old trail running through private property.",
