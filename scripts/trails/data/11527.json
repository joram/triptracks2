    "description": "This trail is not for beginner hikers. You start off climbing right after you cross the creek from the parking lot, and you climb and climb for about 2km.  The grade is steep and trail is composed of rather loose gravel/scree. That was not a big problem when going up, but down was a very unpleasant and scary at times experience. Once you get to the ridge the trail levels off and you walk along the ridge sour ended by breathtaking views of the surrounding mountains and the Kananaskis lakes. The views are well worth the grouping climb and descent.",
    "directions": "From Calgary take Highway 1 west to the Nakiska exit. Follow signs for the ski hill. Go 40km on that highway till you reach the winter gates. There is a sign indicating a left turn into the King's Creek  parking lot. You have to cross the creek and follow the trail up. We didn't want to get our shoes wet so we walked on the highway to cross the creek and started following the path. There are no signs indicating the start of a trail but it's clearly visible and easy to follow. But do pay attention on the way down. It's a bit tricky sometimes to follow it on the way back",
