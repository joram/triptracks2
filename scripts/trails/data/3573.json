    "description": "The 3 kilometre (return) beach trail in Otter Point starts at a secluded public access area with some space to park a car. The beach trail continues past rocky areas and through several very secluded sandy beaches. You will pass by many cliffs and rock walls that provide opportunity for boldering. Near the end of the trail (the point at which it is very difficult to continue without trespassing on private property), there are a few small caverns in the rock walls to explore. The beach near the end is very secluded and well worth the walk.\r\rThe trail ranges from easy to very difficult depending on the tide level. This trail is best enjoyed when the tide is low. In any event, beware of slippery rocks.",
    "directions": "When driving westward from Sooke, take the first left before reaching Carpenter Road in Otter Point.",
