    "description": "This is a long day trip and cannot be accessed untill after am when the gate opens. It is best done in Summer and after a few rainless days for the creek crossing.It is possible to bike the first 6km. The first 11km are fairly easy up the crossing and then the trail get steeper as you ascend to the lake. The lake is a bit of a mud pit with lots of bugs so I wouldn't suggest camping there.\r\r",
    "directions": "Head to Golden Ears Park in Maple Ridge and follow the road to the end where it turns to gravel. Follow it all the way past the bridge to the furthest parking lot. This is the beginning of the East Canyon trail that takes you to the lake.",
