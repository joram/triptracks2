    "description": "NTS Map:92F11.  This trail is about 19 Kms (6 hours) over some rough terrain, nothing that a decent pair of hiking boots can't handle.  You'll have fantastic views from Cruikshank Canyon, with lots of beautiful peaks and valleys to see from here.  Absolutely worth it!  The trail is not so well marked and you are looking for an old 1966 sign that says ?canyon?.  When you come to a small area where you have to cross a small stream, look for a marker here and keep going.  From there on you go across a rocky plateau; make sure to look for the rock cairns for direction.  A fantastic day hike, well recommended.",
    "directions": "Forbidden Plateau: The main access route to Forbidden Plateau from Courtenay and Campbell River is via the Paradise Meadows Trailhead at Mount Washington. From Highway 19 follow signs to Mount Washington Ski Resort via exit #130 (the Strathcona Parkway) for 20 km. Turn left onto the Nordic Lodge road for 1.5 km to the Paradise Meadows parking lot.",
