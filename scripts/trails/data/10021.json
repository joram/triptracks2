    "description": "Fairly easy loop in Kalamaka Park. Varied flat & some up slope. Combination of old road and trails.",
    "directions": "I have found the best way to approach this side of the Park is from the water towers at the top of Cunliffe Road. Drive up to the top of Cunliffe and park. Walk up & past the two water towers and continue up until you get to the old road. Turn Left and follow the road until you come to the Wall trail. Turn right at this junction. Hike up until you come to the Parabola trail and turn right. Follow the trail down until you are back at the old road then down past the water towers.",
