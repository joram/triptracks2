    "description": "A couple of small falls on this assuming brook is the only thing this hike will offer.  I was looking for some mysterious cliffs close by  so I added a couple of potential falls to visit.  This one panned out.  The walk to it is better done by the side of the stream where you will walk through a mixed forest with an ease seldom seen on the Eastern Shore.  I started on an old road instead and was soon overwhelmed by alders so stay by the side of the stream at all costs.",
    "directions": "Highway 224 north of sheet Harbour.  Turn on   Beaver Mines Rd and park at N45 01.117 W62 40.377 and walk upstream.",
