    "description": "There is a series of waterfalls on this brook from about 15ft over 50ft.  The tallest fall lies the furthest upstream (see gps track).  You can take a blocked off dirt road most of the way until you are under the power lines.  Then veer towards the stream and enter the forest.  After only a few minutes of effort you are rewarded with a spectacular 50ft plus fall.  You can even see this one on Google earth sat imagery.   Downstream of the Glengary Rd where your vehicle is parked are 4 more falls...two of which I visited and two more where the stream empties into the salmon River.  Didn?t have enough time/ daylight to make it to the last two.  Bugs were crazy around the brooks and falls but not so bad in the woods.",
