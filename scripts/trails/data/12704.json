    "description": "Great all season circuit of three moderate hills that makes for a convenient loop back to your starting point. Walk back up Sooke Road a couple hundred metres before ducking into the forest underneath the power lines, following the GPS route through the hills, starting at the locally named Alan's Alp, followed by Tony's Triumph, and finishing off the final Amigo in David's Delight. The route than loops back to the Veitch Creek trail and returns to Sooke Road.",
    "directions": "From Victoria, drive North on Highway 1 until the exit for Sooke/Port Renfrew. Head west on Veterans Memorial Parkway (Highway 14), and then following the highway by turning right on Sooke Road. Take this until the mailboxes on the right hand side of the road, just passed the end of the double lanes of traffic.",
