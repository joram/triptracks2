    "description": "Trail is flat 1.5 km to Sol Duc Falls, then up 500 m or so to Deer Lake. Trail is generally rocky, but firm rocks, so although you want to watch your steps, not too much risk of rolling rocks. Very similar to most west coast trails, with destination being a pretty, small lake, Deer Lake. Walk around it (approx 1 km), use one of the camp sites for lunch. You can then head up to the ridge above the lake, follow the Seven Lakes Basin trail (did not do it, will have to wait another day (or another hiker) for this).After the hike, drive south 3 kms from the TH to Sol Duc Hot Springs and rest your weary muscles in the hot springs. They also sell ice cream bars in the lodge.",
    "directions": "Drive west from Port Angeles WA approx 40 kms to Solduc Rd (on left) in Olympic National Park. Soleduc Rd is approx 2 kms (1.5 miles) west of the west end of Crescent Lake. Then drive 22 kms (13 miles) south to the very end of Solduc Rd, 3 kms past the Sol Duc Hot Springs.",
