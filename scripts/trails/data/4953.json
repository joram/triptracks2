    "description": "One of the most pristine places in the State.  Well used but certainly big enough for all.  Not many residents on the lake and most of them are at the Northern end.  The launch is at the Southern end as well as Bigelow Hollow State Park, which contains most of the trail hiking.  Some of the cleanest water and best fishing in the State.  I have even participated in ice fishing here which is quite popular.  My highest recommendation.  There is a fee charged at the entrance to the park between Memorial and Labor Days.  Don't tell anyone, but the attendant is usually gone around 5 PM.  The park closes at dark so you'll need another take out if you want to night fish, and there isn't one unless you own one of the houses.  If you have never been here, please try it.",
    "directions": "Bigelow Hollow State Park is on Rt. 197 in Union.  Take Rt. 190 North (Exit 73 off Interstate 84) and 197 will be a right hand turn only 2 miles from the highway.",
