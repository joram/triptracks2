    "description": "This is an absolutely beautiful trail.  From beginning to end, you will have fantiastic views of the surrounding mountains and as you move up, of the valley bellow.  You will never be in the trees, you will be in the sun for the full trail, there is water every 5 minutes, what more could you ask for.  The only drawback is that there is no real 'destination', you cannot attain the summit from this side, but it is a beautiful hike.",
    "directions": "The trailhead is a little hard to find .. it took us a few hours despite some pretty good directions.  We made some GPS readings of the way out to help people find the trailhead.  We will try to upload them.  Trust us, get the gps map for the drive up .. you will miss the forest service road .. probably more than once :-)\nBasic directions to the trailhead are:  At the Hiway 1 / Hiway 9 interchange near Chilliwack, while travelling East just before the exit ramps, look for a exit to a service road running on the South side of #1.  There may be other access points named Popkum, Cheam or Bridal Falls Road.  Follow this road initially East and follow it as it turns and winds South (and East and West and eventually back North) as it wraps around the South side of Mt. Archibald.",
