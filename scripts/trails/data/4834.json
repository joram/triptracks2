    "directions": "Park at the Cleveland Dam lot just off Capilano Road.  Head across the dam and follow the signs for the Baden Powell.  The first 30-45 minutes will go through the backyards of houses in West Vancouver.   You then into the woods, cross a couple rivers, then arrive at the Cypress Nordic Centre.  Follow the signs along the cross country ski trails until you are directed back into the woods again.  Continue across a couple more streams until you exit by the Easy Rider chair.",
