    "description": "Topo map: 11L06\r\nThis is a dedicated XC ski trail groomed by the National Park services. We most often tour it as a night ski, so we can stop to listen for owls. (thus... no pix!)\r\n\r\nIt's a stacked loop with an outer 3.7K circuit, and two shorter connectors for shorter stints. (Not on GPS)\r\n\r\nThe route is cut through a planted softwood forest, and looks \"other-wordly\" with the tall straight rows of trees.\r\n\r\nShannon Burt\r\nEast Coast editor",
    "directions": "Enter the PEI National Park, and follow the perimeter road toward the stanhope exit. Before the exit, on your left, is the marked trailhead.",
