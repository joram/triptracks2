    "description": "The trail will pop out onto 30m of mowed trail maintained by the owner of the 5433 house. A neighbor said that locals and visitors all use this trail to access the cave. Of course if you are uneasy crossing the mowed part of the path feel free to ask the owner to do so - he won't mind as far as the neighbors tell me. Continue on now on a well worn dirt trail. You will eventually see a sink hole entrance to the cave to your left (see picture below). Thank goodness you don't need to do anything with this entrance :-> Continue on past the sinkhole to the riverbed below. You will see the entrance to the cave here.  The cave is only 100m from the parking area and is located at: N 45\u00b0 33.478 W 065\u00b0 31.599This is another one of my favorite caves.  A relatively large entrance (though wet with a stream running thru it) that leads to two large rooms.  The kids love it.  Please be prepared if you plan on caving.  For more information on this cave go to the New Brunswick Museum on Douglas Ave. in Saint John and ask for this publication:  (1) Arseneault, S.P., Schroeder,J., Berube, D., and Albert,R. 1997.
