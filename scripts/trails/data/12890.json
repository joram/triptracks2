    "description": "Well marked, easy to find trail. The trail is only about 5 KM, but there's some mud!  Haida Gwaii, mud ...it's like a rule.Take the lower trail head (with marker post, no sign) as you'll slog through the worst part and get you prize at the end.  There was lots of Eagle activity and fish jumping in the river when we were there.",
    "directions": "A few KM above the Tlell Fire Hall, parking is on right.  Trailhead visible from road. See GPS map on right.",
