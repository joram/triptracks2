    "description": "This was a great trip that we did with a group of beginners. They really liked it and its an easy backpacking trip. Not too many ups and alot of flat areas. Its pretty cool, after walking down hill for most of the trip you cross the Mass. Pike and watch all the cars drive by.\r\rThe shelter is one of the nicest areas on the AT. During the summer you can stay in the hut and get food from the hut. We went during the fall but I imagine it would be perfect anytime of the year.",
    "directions": "This requires two cars, the first parking area is on a road off Rt. 8, the road's name is Country Road, at the end of the road there is a small parking area where the AT crosses. Its just past the dream lodge.\r\rThe end parking lot that we used is actually before upper goose, its right off Rt. 20, one of the road crossings that you have on your way to upper goose. We back tracked to the parking lot after spending the night at upper goose.",
