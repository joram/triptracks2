    "description": "This is a fall located in Stillwater, near Sherbrooke.  The easiest access to the fall is off an active (spring 2019) logging Road.  I knocked on the door beside the logging road to gain access to the road and fall.  The first part of the logging road can be scenic as you gain a lot of elevation and soon you can see the hills surrounding the St Marys River.  Follow this road until it disappears into a small pond.  There is no more bridge over the brook here but that?s okay.  This is Cross Brook.  Looking downstream take the right hand side of the brook. This is important as it is far easier and less sketchy on that side of the river to gain a view point of the fall.Within 200m after leaving the road, you come to the top of the fall.  Get down carefully and bask in this glorious 45ft fall!",
