    "description": "Long gentle day hike, in this seldom visited part of the park. Great views of Red Castle Ridge and other amazing geological features of the area. Good view of the toe of the Kaskawulsh Glacier. The first 9 km is actually an ATV track, to facilitate maintenance by parks staff. Don?t be surprised that the trail temporarily drops in elevation at the 9 km mark, as it cuts around the plateau, and becomes a more exposed trail. This was our favourite hike in Kluane Park.",
    "directions": "Trailhead is 2.6 km behind the Sheep Mountain Visitor Centre on Kluane Lake, north of Haines Junction. After 2 km cross Sheep Creek and continue until the trail forks at the 2.8 km signpost. Turn right and head up to the plateau. The trail ends at the 12 km signpost.",
