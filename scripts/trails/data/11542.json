    "description": "This is a wide trail which starts off the rails to trail.  It then veers off towards the Cornwallis River.  You enter a mixed stand and there are a lot of large deciduous trees and some views of the marshlands.  Into the forest you will spot a lot of secondary trails for mountain biking (flagged with pink tape) and some more wide trails.  One of which I took and followed for a while until I emerged into a large sand pit.....not the best way to go when you are wearing sandals.  My gps track will then show how I cut across some woods and back unto the rails to trail.",
    "directions": "Highway 1 in Kentville.  Turn into the parking lot of the Evergreen home for special care.  In the back corner of the parking is the access point for the rail to trail and the bird sanctuary trail",
