    "description": "Bonnie and I spent the week doing different paddles and hikes on the island.  The day before this trip we ran into two young ladies while kayaking around NE Harbor.  They said we would see more wildlife in this area and that is why we went.  Boy, were they right.  We were joined by porpoises and seals, were surrounded by birds, and I half expected a whale to show up.  Great day.  We entered at the Seal Cove ramp.  Great ramp, but well used and even the relatively large number of parking spots were well utilized.  I would come early.  We paddled North to Foley Island, circled the island and then returned.  Next time I will find a take out further North and find a ride back to the car.  Venturing further North would require planning around wind and tide schedules as Bartlett Narrows would intensify the flow, I am sure.",
    "directions": "If you are on MDI you can find the Seal Cove ramp on any map.  It is on the quiet (West) side of the island.  I hope you enjoy as much as we did.",
