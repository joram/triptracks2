    "description": "This is a sometimes steep front country trail. It follows a creek for about 1/2 of its length. The elevation gain is about 3500 feet in 5 miles, but the most severe elevation changes are over short distances that really sap your energy. Take at least 1 gallon of water for a one way trip (assuming you have a car waiting at the top). There are some spectacular views along the way, but a large portion of the trail will have you under tree cover or walking through narrow sage brush trails where the view is restricted.",
    "directions": "At the end of San Roque road at the city water filtration facility.",
