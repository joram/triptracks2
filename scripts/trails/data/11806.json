    "description": "Sand Hill Side Trail meets the dobson trail about 1km in.. There are a number of firepits along the way.. There are some \"water traps\" but there should be bridges, walkways to avoid them... The trail intersecs a couple clear cuts but you will see yellowish blazes to guide you. At the end there is a sign telling you the direction and distance to the south and north exits..",
    "directions": "From Riverview get on the pine glen road, drive past the dobson trail main entrance for another 5km (give or take). They'll be a fork in the road. Keep to the right side and keep driving another 5km. They'll be sign for dobson trail on your right side.",
