    "description": "This hike starts at the South Kaibab Trailhead (elev. 7210 Ft) and proceeds downhill to the junction of the Tonto trail (Elev. 4070 FT). The hike down the Kaibab is the most scenic of the hike and time should be allotted to enjoy the views. Turn left ( West) at the Junction of West Tonto trail 4.6 miles from the trailhead and follow the well-marked trail, through the Canyon to the Bright Angel Trail, a distance of 4.3 miles, for a total of 8.9 miles. There is no water on the Kaibab or Tonto trails, so take a minimum of 3 litres, if hiking in the early spring.The remainder of the hike is mostly up hill to the Bright Angel Lodge. Water is available at the Indian Gardens, at a total distance of 9.2 miles.The first of 53 switchbacks starts at 10.3 miles out at an elevation of 4215 feet, with 2675 feet gain ahead.The hike up the Bright Angel trail to the Bright Angel Lodge is grueling at times. Make sure that you have replenished your water supply at Indian Gardens before heading up.We I did this hike in November 2013 it too us 7 hours to complete.The best time to do this hike is in November or March; before the snow flies or before the heat returns.",
    "directions": "From the Bright Angel Lodge head east on Village Loop Drive. Then take South Entrance Road past the Grand Canyon Visitor Center. Turn left at Desert View Drive ( Hwy 64) and then turn left at Yaki Point Road, which will take you to the South Kaibab Trailhead.This is the scenic route. If you are coming directly into the South Rim take highway 64 to Yaki Point Road and turn right to get to the Trailhead.",
