    "description": "Very Fun!!!  Mostly switchbacks & twisty turns.  Not technical, but there are a few built up areas.  Some great lookouts as the trail climbs up the mountainside.  Very enjoyable ride and a great warm-up to a technical ride.",
    "directions": "From Whistler, you can bike along the paved recreation trail almost all the way there or take the road in the direction of Pemberton.  It?s about 10 km outside of Whistler.  The trailhead is just past Emerald & the Heliport at the Wedgemount parking lot.  Cross the bridge and take the road on the left.  The road will fork, so take the right branch and you will see the trailhead on your right (there's a wood post marking it).  From there the fun begins!  This trail will eventually lead you right back to the bridge and parking lot.",
