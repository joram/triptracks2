    "description": "We went on this expedition on February 20, 2010 to go see Jack Lake, a decommissioned reservoir/lake. We were surprised how easy it actually was! Don't let the 10.5km one way distance fool you. These are for the most part overgrown logging roads with ups and downs.\r\rJack Lake was decommissioned in 1996 when there were concerns that the dam on this lake would not survive and earthquake and it would release a tsunami. \r\r~The lake is no longer used for drinking water purposes.\r~According to the CRD Natural Areas Atlas, this in the Sooke Hills Regional Park Reserve, not the watershed district\r~There may be a closed gate 200m from the lake. You may pass if you wish.",
    "directions": "Drive towards Sooke on route 14 and just before the four lane section of highway narrows down to two, you should see this sawmill place on the right side. Just after that, you will see a large gravel patch and a row of mailboxes.\rPark and walk back ~300 m NE on the highway and you will see a small trail leading up. If you count back 6 telephone poles, you should see it.",
