    "description": "Mount Webb is located in Chilliwack Lake Provincial Park. To get to the top you follow the trail to Radium Lake. From there, the unmaintained trail will lead to the col between MacDonald Peak and Mt Webb. From the col, it's a scramble to the top. Keep to the right (South Eastern) side of the slope which is less steep.",
