    "description": "A pleasant snowshoe though open, evergreen forest. Total ascent was 325 m over 6 kms, much of the trail being flat, with most of the climb being at the west end, so quite steep, and a bit on the last 1 km heading back to the Nordic Centre.\r\rFirst 2 km from the Nordic Centre heading west is well marked, but poorly marked around the west end loop, we lost the snowshoe trail on several occasions and often walked along the edges of the cross country trails.\r\rGood views at several points. Lots of snow.",
    "directions": "From Nelson, drive 12 kms south along Hwy 6 towards Salmo, and at the Whitewater Ski Resort sign, head east 10 kms, up a climb of approx 800 m on a good gravel road. Take a sharp left into the Nordic Centre parking lot just as you arrive at the downhill parking lot, and park near the cabin. Nordic Centre guide on Feb 20, 2010 was extremely helpful and friendly. Cost for snowshoe tix was $5 each, and included a map of the trails.\r\rStart of the snowshoe trail is just behind and below (south) of the Nordic Centre cabin.\r\rWhitewater's website is at: http://www.skiwhitewater.com/",
