    "description": "This a 4 kilometer walk in the woods along a creek. It's a pleasant and relatively easy walk unless the trail is slippery with either snow (as we experienced) or spring mud. There are beaver dams in the area and birds depending on season. Chickadees were flying all around in November.\r\rThere are a number of bird houses and feeders in the area.\r\rThe trail is on private land but permission is granted for hiking the trail.",
    "directions": "East of Wetaskiwin on highway 13 to township road 264, south on 264 to very near the Gwynne ski canyon ski area. Park off road just across the tracks, follow a very obvious cut line up steep hill to a sign on the left near the top which indicates the trail head.",
