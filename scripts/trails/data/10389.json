    "description": "A short distance from highway 215 at Kempt Shore lies a beautiful, hidden, waterfall.\nMake your way to the stream?s edge and walk in a downstream manner to the edge of the waterfall.  This fall is a good 25ft high and falls directly in the Bay of Fundy.  There is some rope attached to one side of the cliff face beside the fall to presumably aid you to climb down the rock escarpment.  Since I never trust ropes that I haven?t placed myself, I followed the contour of the escarpment to the North of the fall for about 150m until I found a suitable waydown to the sea floor.",
    "directions": "Highway 215 towards Cheverie.  The stream that you need to follow downstream crosses the highway at approximately N45 07 07.7 W64 11 37.3.",
