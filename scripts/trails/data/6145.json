    "description": "Memorial Lakes is an unofficial trail and is not well maintained. However it is well traveled.\r\rThe path is quite narrow and has a lot of ups and downs. For most of the time you will be following the North Ribbon Creek.\r\rDo this hike later in the summer to make sure all of the snow is clear and you can make it to the third lake. We went down the scree slope between Mount Bogart and the third lake. The scree was quite large and inconsistent, so it actually took us longer to take this 'short cut' then if we would have retraced our steps. \r\rIf you are uncomfortable with streep scree I would recommend retracing your steps back around Bogart back down to the second lake.",
    "directions": "The Trail Head is the Ribbon Creek Day Use area. If follows the Ribbon Creek Trail for 3 KM. There is a rock pile on the north side of the trail that marks the begining of the Memorial Lakes Trail.",
