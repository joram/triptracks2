    "description": "This is a hike/ride from West of the 5km marker on Lac du Bois Road, past Green Lake (so labeled by Doug Smith for it?s green colour) to Lac du Bois Lake. About the first 65% of this route is up hill and while there are a few short and steeper stretches, the majority of it isn?t that severe and no problem for a bike. It is done on an old road and is sage and grasslands and depending on the time of the day, maybe a bit of shade from Wheeler Mountain at the top. If you are doing this route in the Spring, you will see a large number of birds on the lakes.",
    "directions": "Drive up Bachelor Road and continue up Lac du Bois Road until you reach the 5km marker. Shortly after  the marker, you will cross a cattle guard after which you will take the road to the left. Travel to the next cattle guard, about 0.9km and park at the base of a road going up the hill to the right. This road is used by Parks and Range Patrol so please do not block it. The total route stays on this road and there are a couple of left branches, but stay to the right up the hill.When you get to the top, the road follows along the base of Wheeler Mountain. First you will come to Green Lake then Lac du Bois Lake. The road meets up with Lac du Bois Road so if you want to do a one way shuttle, it is very possible.My stats:Total distance: 10.53kmTotal Ascent: 268m (880ft)Total time: 2:28Moving time: 2:16",
