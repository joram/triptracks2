    "description": "I pride myself at having been, explored and even discovered a whack of waterfalls in Nova Scotia.  I am shame to admit that there was one in my backyard which I didn't get to until late 2016.   Beaver dam Brook Fall is located in the Long Lake Provincial Park just outside Halifax and is surprisingly worth the detour. There is a trail all the way from the parking lot right to the fall.  The main fall is a good 15 feet drop and that's high for waterfalls set in granitic rocks!   The trail to it is well maintained to start with and then becomes a mud path as you ascend a hill.  On the other hand you can also follow the lake and it is less wet to get through that way.  Both path will lead you to a small stream which you then follow up or down to the main fall.  The main fall has a large pool at its bottom and a huge fallen tree across the small ravine.",
    "directions": "St Margarets Bay Road to the Lon Lake parking lot at 44.632298, -63.658336.  Head on the west side of the lake to the fall by following my gps track.",
