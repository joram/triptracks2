    "description": "This track travels around the outside loop of the mountain. It uses numerous Kalamalka Lake Park Trails including Cosen's Bay, Sidewinder, Lookout and Comin' Round the Mountain. Total distance traveled was 8.5km. If you want a longer distance, you could go directly down to Cosen's Bay instead of using Sidewinder to bypass that drop down & back up.",
    "directions": "From the Main Parking Lot & Gate, take the main trail going to Cosen's Bay. Cross the road and start down the hill. After about 300-400 meters you will see a couple of trails going to the right. Take either one and they will take you to Sidewinder. Sidewinder travels along the base of the cliffs and is an easier and more pleasant route rather than the one down to Cosen's Bay and back up. Once you reach the intersection of the trail coming up from Cosen's Bay, you start a long and fairly steep climb to the top. Once you reach the top, you will see a spit in the trail and a bench. The left trail goes to Rattlesnake Point, the right goes towards the Red Gate and Comin' Round the Mountain trail. After this point, the trail spits several times. If you want to stay at a lower level, stay towards the left. If you take two right branches, you will meet up with the Lookout Trail as shown. Go left on Lookout and then stay to the right and the trail will come out at the Red Gate. Turn right and proceed up Comin' Round the Mountain. When you get past the Water Tower exit, you can travel on 300-400 meters then instead of staying on the road, take the trail on the left which then joins back up onto the road, travels a bit further then there is a trail to the right. This trail then joins back onto the road and you complete your hike back to the parking lot.",
