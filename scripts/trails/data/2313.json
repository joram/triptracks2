    "description": "This trail is actually in the Dominican Republic, not Puerto Rico.  (But wouldn't you rather be there?):.The time and distance for this trail is based on a one-way trip, with the return to the bottom using the gondola (Teleferico).  This trail starts at the base of the gondola, and more or less follows it up.  With a gps and these coordinates, you will have no trouble finding your way, although there is some dense bushwhacking through jungle near the top.  Ignore the pesky guides at the base.  Don't worry, the WAAS signal gives your gps excellent accuracy in the Dominican.  If you do not have a GPS, hire a guide, as the trail does branch and fade out in several places.  On this trail, you will see a myriad of jungle flora, as well as some interesting fauna... We spotted a tarantula!  Wear long pants and long sleeves, despite the soaring temperatures and high humidity, as some things in the forest are very itchy!",
    "directions": "Grab a cab anywhere around Puerto Plata and simply ask to go to the Teleferico (gondola).",
