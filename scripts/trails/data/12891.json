    "description": "Completed on October 14, 2017 snow-covered and blizzard conditions from Burstall PassPossible bike approach for the first 2.9 kmEdwards Rating: I (II) L M5.5 to 8.5 hoursElevation of 894 m NET, 982 m TOT & max 2789 mGear: Poles (every hike), helmet (every scramble), microspikes, ice axe and maybe crampons if snow covered (be avalanche aware early-late season).*****This is a very easy scramble technically with a well-defined trail most of the time it seems (snow-covered when completed) but I rated it as a moderate because of the long approach. We had views only while under the Pass but it is surrounded by stunning and impressive peaks like Mount Birdwood, French and Sir Douglas to name a few. The West face of Whistling Rock Peak is also quite impressive with gigantic vertical slabs. We followed the popular Burstall Pass trail and turned right (north) once at the Pass/connecting ridge to Snow Peak summit. You can?t miss it, you actually see it from the parking lot and many times during the approach on Burstall Pass trail. We followed the ridge and saw an obvious trail from time to time but couldn?t care less as we were dealing with extreme wind gusts, snow and we stayed away from the cliff on our right in these conditions. We struggled a little bit with two rock bands but in dry conditions that would have been no problem at all for sure. We did use our microspikes to make it easier and even though we had no views in this whiteout at the top, I am positive it would be worth the trip with a clear sky because of several imposing peaks around here. Snow accumulation was recent and minimal today but I am not sure I would be comfortable doing that peak with a deeper snowpack as we don?t have avalanche safety gear nor courses completed yet.",
    "directions": "From Calgary, follow Trans-Canada Hwy/AB-1 W to Kananaskis Trail/AB-40 S and take exit 118. Drive south for about 50 km and turn right on Kananaskis Trail/AB-742. Follow that road for about 23 km and park at Burstall Pass parking lot on your left.",
