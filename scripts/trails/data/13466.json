    "description": "In an area where hiking destinations are perhaps not overwhelming, this is one of the jewels to be found.  Nestled in the barrens next to shag Harbour is a series of erratics, one of which is absolutely huge!  You can even spot it on sat imagery.  I set off from a cemetery but it might be faster to walk and or drive perhaps on that rail to trails.\n\nFrom the cemetery it was an easy traverse to some ATV trails that are running towards the erratic.  Follow the main ATV path and towards the erratic you will need to take a right at a Y intersection.  See the GPS tracks its pretty easy!  The back of the erratic has a man-made ladder to use at your own caution!   The rock is super solid, lots of small cracks for bouldering opportunities!",
