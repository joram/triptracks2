    "description": "The trail is uneventful the the best is the lake itself situated on top of Nose Mountain very nice place to camp and canoe if carried in and fish. Very nice views of the surrounding mountain going up the Muddy Creek Road.",
    "directions": "From Grande Prairie travel south on Highway 40 to the Wapiti bridge then turn right on the Two lakes road on to secondary highway 666. Travel this road all the way to Nose Creek Bridge. Just before this bridge is the Muddy creek road take a left and follow for 30 km. Look for a small trail leading left this is your trailhead. I've included gps data for both the muddy creek road and the trail.",
