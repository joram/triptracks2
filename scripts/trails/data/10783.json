    "description": "The UBC VOC winter trail is now a summer trail. Logging roads take you up high so only a 300 meter elevation climb over 6kms. Brew Lake is only 4 hours up and is among alpine meadows. An additional hour or so will get you to a 16 person hut ($5). For more information go to http://www.ubc-voc.com/wiki/Brew_Hut",
