    "directions": "We did this in both directions I'd recommend going counterclockwise. Starting from pullout 300m West of Beaverflat campground. Hop over the guard rail and go to metal post, descend to T junction. I'd recommend turning right and following the Rainy Creek trail. Going the other direction we couldn't find the correct start of the Rainy Creek trail below Rainy pass",
