    "description": "This is a popular hike and a very popular area for sport climbers. The trail leads to two small turquoise blue lakes. From the parking lot, follow the service road for the first 100 metres, then keep left on the well-defined hiking trail. The first kilometre is a gentle ascent through forest with a delightful assortment of wildflowers in bloom throughout the month of June. Approximately 100 meters into the hike is the first intersection (waypoint #002). At this point you can choose the easy or more difficult route. The easy route appears to be a fire road but by taking this route you miss out on the waterfall and views of Canmore and the Bow Valley. The more difficult route is not very difficult but as always you have to watch your footing. On the more difficult route there is a series of stairs to make the climb easier. On the way up are great views of Ha Ling Peak and at the top the two lakes. For more adventurous souls, a short scramble above the upper lake takes you to a canyon and a genuine petroglyph on a large boulder. The area around and above the upper lake is also a popular spot for sport climbing and provides lots of entertainment if you like watching spandex-clad climbers practice their moves.",
    "directions": "The trailhead is located 4.7 km south of Canmore on the Smith-Dorrien-Spray Lakes Road (Highway 742).To get there from the west or far end of Canmore's Main Street (8th St.), follow the signs for the Canmore Nordic Centre which will take you south of town. When you reach the end of the pavement just past the Nordic Centre, turn left at the Grassi Lakes sign. Follow this descending road for 500 metres and you will see the trailhead on your right.",
