    "description": "I parked my SUV and started the bicycle trek at Pijeboogwek parking area near the main information center in the park.  I peddled some 25.50 miles or 41.04 km in 3 hrs plus stops totalling 1 hr and 6 min.  This was the longest bike trek that I have done in the park  It was a beautiful day with plenty of sunshine and temperatures in the high 60's.The trails (crushed gravel) are in excellent shape with mainly flat terrain.  There are washrooms strategically placed thorughout the park and two canteens(only open in summer).  If you hike then there are numerous hiking trails in the park.  There is even a facility to rent canoes or peddle boats.",
    "directions": "Go to main park office to acquire day pass and then park at the first lot called Pijeboogwek.",
