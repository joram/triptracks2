    "description": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nentree island\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOne of the highlights of our trip to the \r\nMadeleine Islands, was our over night trip to \r\nEntree island, one of two regions in the \r\narchipelago where English dominates.\r\n\r\nThe Island lies about 10K off shore from \r\nthe rest of the islands. One certainly could \r\nkayak \r\nthere, given the right conditions. We \r\nunfortunately went on days where strong \r\nwinds made for huge swells and white caps, \r\nand our boats were left at home.\r\nThere are a few ways to get to the \r\nisland. A \r\ncouple of tour operators have passenger \r\nvessels and interpretive staff if that's \r\nwhat you want. The government offers a \r\nsmall car ferry for a few dollars cheaper that \r\nleaves out the frills. Finally, with a small \r\nairport on the island, a small aircraft takes \r\npassengers to and from Entree Island.\r\n\r\nWe got there in the morning, and our first \r\norder was to find Suzanne from  \r\nVert et Mer\r\n. She operates a small campground \r\nat \r\nthe foot hills of the community pasture land. \r\nWith some questions to the local \r\nshopkeepers, we were pointed in the right \r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nTo say that the island is hilly is an \r\nunderstatement. Thinking of the view out of \r\nour vestibule, more than anything sensible, \r\nwe pitched our tent on the top of one of \r\nthose hills. With the wind gusts shaking the \r\ntent that night, we hardly slept a wink.\r\n\r\nThere is one official trail documented on the \r\nisland, and it's called the James Quinn \r\ntrail. Quinn was a popular mayor of the area \r\na few years back. This trail leads you from \r\nthe area of the museum into the pasture \r\nland, and up Big Hill, notably the highest \r\npoint of the entire archipelago.\r\nGiven the length of the trail, it sounds \r\nlike \r\nsimply a tourist attraction. The cool part is \r\nthat this trail is but only a launching point to \r\nexploring the entire pasture land. The locals \r\ncertainly don't mind. As long as you \r\nleave the cows in peace, you're free to \r\nroam the hills. And that's certainly \r\nwhat we did both days we were there.\r\n\r\nBeyond the Quinn trail, there are no real \r\ntrails to follow. You see something cool, and \r\noff you go! Occasionally, you'll find \r\nATV paths, but otherwise, cow paths \r\noccasionally show you the best route \r\nbetween hills. Note that these hills can be \r\nvery steep, and sometimes they slope to a \r\ncliff into the sea, so common sense must \r\ndictate where you go. One of the thoughts \r\nthat occured to me as we explored the hills, \r\nwas how great a place to hold an \r\norienteering course.\r\n\r\nSome highlights we encountered included a \r\nsmall scattering of cows and horses, a \r\nkeyhole rock formation, the small natural \r\nterracing that contours the hills, the honest-\r\nto-God super friendly people, and finally, the \r\nhuge treeless rich green grassy hills. \r\nIt's sureal. This is the premier \"\r\nmust-do\" when you visit the Madeleine \r\nIslands. If you ever do bring your kayaks, \r\nmake sure you paddle around this little \r\nisland, and post it here on Trailpeak!\r\n\r\nWhen you do come to Entree Island, stay for \r\nat least two nights. If you want to pack light, \r\nthere's a B&B, a store, a terrific \r\nmuseum and a couple of restuarants. You \r\ngot to speak with the locals for sure. this \r\nplace certainly has charm. After all that \r\nwalking, put your feet up and relax.\r\n\r\nShannon Burt\r\nEast Coast Editor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r",
