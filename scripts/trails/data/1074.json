    "description": "The trails are a mixture of forest growth and rocky terrain. Spectacular views overlooking Howe Sound from St. Marks and Unnecessary Mountain. Nice view of the Lions from Unnecessary Mtn. Be prepared to hike back up to St. Marks when return from Unnecessary.Note: The GPS for this hike starts from Lions bay (not sure how we allowed that), but there are are a few entries on trailpeak for this hike giving you the directions and GPS from the Cypress ski area.  To see the trail to St. Marks along Howe Sound, with GPS for the approach from Cypress, check here or use the search form to find variations for Howe Sound.",
    "directions": "Take highway #1 to Cypress parkway. Park your car at the ski area parking lot. Note:you will have to pay a $5 fee for provincial parks. Trailhead begins to the left of the Eagle chairlift.",
