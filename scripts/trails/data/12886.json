    "description": "We would rate Arethusa Cirque as Easy, and Little Arathusa as Moderate (maybe due to the snow on the steep ascent!)This route is particularly beautiful in Larch season.The Cirque allows for great views from different angles at a higher elevation.Take a map to fully enjoy the views from the top!",
    "directions": "From Calgary, follow Trans-Canada Hwy/AB-1 W to Kananaskis Trail/AB-40 S. Take exit 118 and start your odometer at the Casino entrance for about 68 km or 1.3 km passed Highwood Pass parking lot. Park on the left side of the road.",
