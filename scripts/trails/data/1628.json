    "description": "NTS Map: 082J14Elevation Gain: 588 m (1,929 ft).Note - time and distance are one way.This is a continuation of the  Ribbon Falls trail. The trail is much less crowded and only 2km from the falls to the lake. However, there is a cliff to be scaled, which will keep lots of folks away. There are 2 sections to the cliff, each with chains attached to the rock for assistance. Know your limits. These chains are necessary to ascend this cliff.After you get past the cliff, the hike is not difficult, and is short to the lake. The campground is very nice, with a communal firepit, food locker, bear poles, an axe and lots of firewood. At night (at least when we were there), you could hear rocks sliding off the cliffs across the lake.Return the way you came if you feel comfortable descending the cliff (much more difficult than ascending), or make the loop through  Guinn's Pass to  Galatea Creek Trail, or straight through to the Spray Lakes Road via Buller Pass.",
