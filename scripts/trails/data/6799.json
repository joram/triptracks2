    "description": "The Avalon Trail starts from AMC Highland Center at Crawford North. Go on Avalon Trail for 1.2 miles, then the A-Z trail for 1.0 mile We then took a left and summit Mt Tom .5 mile returning back to the intersection. After the first summit of 4000 footer mountain, we took Willey Range Trail 3.4 miles summiting Mt Field and Mt Willey. We then took Ethan Pond trail for .3 mile then picked up Kedron Flume Trail 1.3 miles to where cars will be awaiting us.  The hike in trails were all great and we crossed over some brooks several times, hence, trekking poles are nice to have.\r\rHowever, for hike out, trail condition was sort of terrible.  So many trees were fell down onto the trails.  We had to either went over those or crawled under neath of them.  So it took a long time to complete long hikes.",
    "directions": "The AMC Highland center (302 Bretton Woods) is located 8.5 miles South from the junction of Rt 3 and Rt 302 in New Hampshire state.  The trailhead of Avalon Trail is located at the backside of AMC Highland center.",
