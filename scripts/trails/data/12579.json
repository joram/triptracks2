    "description": "This is one of those places I wanted to visit for a long time.  It started when I was looking at 1:50000 topo and noticed four falls on the same brook.  Usually in NS, it is very rare to see waterfall on maps at all!   Plus this brook was close to Egypt Falls which is a gem.a fellow explorer beat me to the lowest fall so I decided to see the three upper ones.  I mtn biked along some blueberry fields to get closer to the ravine and then dropped into it.  On the far side of the brook is a veritable moose highway.  I spotted one moose but we both had better things to do.  Downstream of where I crossed Mt Pleasant Brook, I followed a tributary upstream for maybe 150m to the first 25ft fall.  A drop surrounded by rock walls.  I made my way upstream for about 700m to the upper fall but all I saw there was some cascade type feature.I then cut across the plateau to go see the third fall.  The third fall was about 10ft high but very broad with a large pool up front.  So the lesson here is that the destination was not as imagined but the journey to get there was pleasant nonetheless.   The mature hardwoods in this area of CB are spectacular.",
