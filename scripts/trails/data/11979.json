    "description": "This is a somewhat rigorous hike from the valley bottom to Porcupine Ridge and beyond to Lime Ridge to the north. Bring lots of water as this area is very exposed and there will be no water to find once above the tree line.",
    "directions": "Go west from Clinton BC until you reach Jesmond Road. Turn right on Jesmond Road. There is a branch road on the right about 10kms north. There is a parking area here but if you have a high clearance vehicle, you can drive an additional 5kms to another parking area.",
