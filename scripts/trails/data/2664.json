    "description": "A short canoe downstream from a small diversion dam.  There are a few faster areas, but no whitewater and nothing even close.  Pass the golf course and under a suspension bridge that links to the trans-canada trail.  Great on a sunday or afternoon.  The channel and the trail finishes at Old Pinawa Dam, a heritage park on the site of an old hydro dam.  A great spot for picnics while you wait to be picked up.",
    "directions": "Turn off highway 11 onto 211.  Follow the highway to the end (about 11 km) and park your car.  Carry your canoe over the small dam and down to the channel via a trail on the far side of a small but highish diversion dam.  Finish and pick-up at Old Pinawa, about 15 minutes by car.  Turn right off 211, when heading out of town, onto highway 520 and Old Pinawa Dam is on the right.",
