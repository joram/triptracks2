    "description": "This is another trail that I ended at a waterafll but the trail continued further.  \nIf the main dirt road is passable you are left with a 3.5km return hike to the fall.  After parking your car by the bridge, follow the road that is along the stream and take the somewhat smaller left path.  the path will immediately start to climb a small hill and through a mainly deciduous forest.  You then come down the hill and start climbing another small hill.  The path is well defined and about the size of an ATV route with lots of hills, so x-country sking would be fun.  Once you reach the stream (1.75km) follow it downstyream to see a few sets of falls.  BTW, there is nothing big enough to climb on.",
    "directions": "Highway 103 to Chester Basin exit (Highway 12).  Take highway 12 North until a dirt road on your right (about 13km).  Turn on that road and follow until you come to a fairly big bridge over a stream at the end of a lake.  Park before the bridge and follow side road on your left...",
