    "description": "These falls aren\u2019t the tallest you\u2019ll find in Cape Breton Island but their location is a gem in itself.  Setting off from a gravel road, the brook is hidden by the dense forest on both sides.  I could hear the roar of a small fall and correctly guessed that a culvert under the road was the culprit.  I started to hike downstream following the brook and very soon the brook began to carve a small ravine.  At this point the forest canopy soars overhead as you walk between giant evergreens.  A lush moss carpet cushions each steps.  Pretty soon you will be at a 5 ft.  I wasn\u2019t sure what I was looking for as I was there on a hunch but I decided to push further downstream and was pleasantly rewarded by two 8-10 ft falls.",
