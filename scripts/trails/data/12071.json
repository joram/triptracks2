    "description": "This can be a difficult hike, in part by the finding of the trail, while hiking in a counterclockwise loop.There are three different routes down,but the best trail requires hiking up over both peaks.We hiked down from the first peak and in part bushwacked down, using my GPS to navigate.",
    "directions": "The Trailhead is at the Highwood House, or the junction leading to Highwood House. The trail does up the hill north of  Highway 40 as it intersects with Highway 541.",
