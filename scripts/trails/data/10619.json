    "description": "From Obstruction Point, take the trail on the left towards ?Deer Park?. Deer Park is 7.5 miles (12 miles) away, so in theory, you could do either a ?cross-over? or park vehicles at both ends. We simply walked 5 kms (3 miles) to the point where the trail dropped steeply, had lunch there and returned.A wonderful hike, with great views of the mountains to the south and west, including Mt Olympus to the SW, and Dungeness Spit, Victoria BC and Mt Baker to the north and east. This is a must do hike in the north Olympics.Don?t be shy to walk up to the tops of the ridge from time to time to view north and east.",
    "directions": "Drive south on Race St in Port Angeles, stop at the visitors? centre just as you enter Olympic NP, and get info and a map. Then drive 17 miles (32 kms) and up from 140 m to 1600 m to Hurricane Ridge. Immediately on the left on arriving at the Hurricane Ridge parking lot, turn sharp left onto the gravel road marked ?Obstruction Point?. The drive rises from 1600 m to 1860 m over 13 kms (8 miles) and you arrive at Obstruction Point. 4WD and AWD vehicles are best, but there were a few ?regular? cars at the trailhead.",
