    "description": "This short hike/walk starts and ends at the north foot of Boundary Road. It's a nice easy trip that takes about 3 hours total. Some urban walking on the way back. \nGo east into Burnaby and follow the TransCanada Trail signs. If you like you can extend the walk into Kensington Park and return from there.",
    "directions": "Boundary Road is the dividing line between Burnaby and Vancouver. This starts and ends at the north end of Boundary Road.",
