    "description": "There were many people there on a Thursday noon hour when I dropped by, both skiers and Society members getting it ready for the season. There are over 125km of named & signed trails with a range of difficulty for skiers from easy to difficult and you can do any length you want by mixing and matching.  The trails are managed by the Larch Hills Nordic Society under a long term management agreement with the Ministry of Forests.Looks very professional and well maintained with many trails to choose from.More info on their website: http://www.larchhillsskiclub.bc.ca/",
    "directions": "Fairly well signed from Salmon Arm, take 97b south from town and watch for the turn 5.7km after turning south from HiWay #1.  You can also go north up the Grandview Bench road 1km West of Grindrod on 97a.  Follow the signs 3km N of the Grandview Bench hamlet, look for John's Ski Shack and keep going another couple km N to parking lot.",
