    "description": "A challenging scramble follows a humpback ridge to the top where you are rewarded with a excellent view of the Athabasca River valley, as well a view of Mt. Colin next door.",
    "directions": "Start off from lay-by/parking lot at east end of bridge over Athabasca River on Hwy16 (about 20km east of Jasper).  Easy jaunt for 40mins to reach a creek which should be crossed, then follow the right bank up side of mountain. Off  the right is criss-crossed with the remains of burned out tree limbs and after 20mins you face the steep incline of (what shall be) a defining limestone ridge. Looking for red ribbon markings, head straight-up keeping left and avoiding the temptation to stray off to the gentler slopes over to the right.",
