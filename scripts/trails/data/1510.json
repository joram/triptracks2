    "description": "NTS Map: 082J14Elevation gain: approx. 1000 m (3,280 ft) from the parking lot.From the parking area, cross the road and look for a trail on the left (north) side of the creek.  The trail follows the edge of the creek valley via a fairly well defined trail to West Wind Pass.Look back while climbing for good views of the Spray Lakes.  From the pass great views of the Wind Valley and the Three Sisters can be had.From a slightly flat area just below the pass you should be able to spot a trail to the right (south-east).  The trail skirts around below the cliff bands and follows along the top of the steep slope just above the treeline.  You can choose to ascend at any point, but the easiest route is gained be traversing for a fair distance and climbing up past the cliff bands on easier ground.  The easiest trail is the most defined but can be confused with sheep trails.The trail should take you to the saddle between Loughheed and Windtower.  From there follow the ridge to the top.  Great views of the Wind Valley and the Spray Lake can be had from the top.  Be prepared for the wind.  Also be careful at the top as the descent to the Wind Valley is a near vertical cliff.A shorter descent route can be had by going across one of the cliff bands.The trail is also described in the Kananskis Country trail Guide, trail #66",
