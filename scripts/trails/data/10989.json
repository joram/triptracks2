    "description": "An excellent shoulder season hike, approx. 7-8 kms north of Squamish, right off Highway 99.We started at the small parking lot approx 2 kms south of Brohm Lake. Beware: if driving north on the highway, you are not supposed to turn left across the road into the parking lot, you should drive north to Brohm Lake, turn around and drive back, or, simply start at Brohm Lake.A very well groomed trail for nearly 3/4 of it, the rest still nicer than most West coast trails. We traveled 12 kms, circled around Brohm Lake, went up to Tantalus view point, and took in 3-4 other view points along the Cheakamus Loop. Don't miss the sharp right hand uphill turn after the view points looking south along the Cheakamus Loop. Much of the forest is quite open Lodge Pole Pine, with western red cedar, Douglas fir, other pine and some spruce, several types of deciduous trees also, including Big Leaf Maple, alder, etc...Follow the map or GPS data. We did the trail counter clockwise, ie, went north to Brohm Lake, around the north end of the lake, and then south to the High Trail.",
    "directions": "Hway99, 3-4 kms north of the Alice Lake turnoff, look for the small parking lot on the west side of the road, with yellow gate and large sign at the trail head. If you see the Cat Lake turnoff on the right, you've gone too far.",
