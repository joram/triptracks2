    "description": "NTS Map: 082A13Elevation Gain: 685 m (2,247 ft).It is a gradual climb of 2300 feet, and includes waterfalls, a natural tunnel in the rock, a cliff traverse and of course Crypt Lake. (I am told this is one of the best trails in Canada and personally I would have to agree).The pictures are from top (Crypt Lake) more or less back to bottom as follows.  Enjoy.The first is Crypt Lake itself.The second is along the traverse across the ledge between the tunnel and the lake. The third is taken in the tunnel. The fourth is another alpine lake visible in the valley. The fifth is a view of Waterton Lake from the trail.The sixth is a shot of a waterfall as one approaches Crypt Lake.It should also be noted that a short side trip can be taken while on the Crypt Trail to Hell Roaring Falls. We opted to skip it on this trip as we are going back this summer to take our kids as far as the falls.  About 4 kilometres up Crypt Trail one can veer off on a short trail to the falls. I'll send you some shots of that; I hear they are spectacular!For another perspective on this trail, click  here",
    "directions": "Catch the water taxi in Waterton across Waterton Lake to the trailhead. The trailhead itself is well marked and it's all up-hill from there!",
