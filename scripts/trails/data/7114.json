    "description": "This MTB trail runs through a protected Big Tree recreation site as well as the Sechelt Community Forest (logging might occur). It leads you to Desoto Ridge where the well preserved remains of a Desoto car are resting in the forest. The route is over intermediate trails using the beaver pond trail, forest service road, part of Rockabilly, Bypass, Desoto Ridge, Over Easy, Easy Street, Skullduggery, and back around the beaver pond. It is easy to lengthen the route by using other local trails in this area, local bike shops have the most up to date trail maps for the Sunshine Coast. \rThere are some steep sections in this trail.",
    "directions": "Parking is available at the Big Tree Recreation Site. Nine kms north of Sechelt on Highway 101, and 400m before Trout Lake, take the Halfmoon-Carlson Forest Service Road which leaves the highway at a small rock quarry on your right.  Proceed exactly 2.8 kms on the main logging road, ignoring spurs to the left and right.  Park at a wide spot immediately beyond the trail. (www.scrd.ca)",
