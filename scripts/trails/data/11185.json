    "description": "Nice walk through forest with several nice viewpoints.  Choice of many trails; the waypoints combine parts of the Chekamous Loop Trail, High Trail, Bridge Trail, Brohm Lake Trail and Alder Trail to make a nice loop which includes a nice view from a Fire Outlook.  Not busy, except for sections near lake.  Some noise from highway on parts of the trail.  Reccomended for kids / families.",
    "directions": "1st waypoint is the parking lot, which is about 2 km north of the Alice Lake turnoff, a few minutes north of Squamish.  If travelling North, you may have to turn around at the main Brohm Lake parking lot (about 2 km further north) and drive back.  Parking lots are on the West side of the highway.",
