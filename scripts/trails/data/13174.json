    "description": "Unmarked trail starting across Resting area. The path most of the time is visible. On top of the hill difficult to see the path but just go to the end of the hill for a nice view. Although it is almost 400m climb there are no steep climbs and it is a relatively easy trail. During spring path is wet with two stream crossing that requires some skills and waterproof boots and you still can get wet because stones are covered but fast running water.",
