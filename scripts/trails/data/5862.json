    "description": "Bookcliffe's defines flow.  The best part -- you camp at area 18 (free) and the trails are all around you.  There is a general grade to the whole network from the camp area down to the plains below.  Kessels Run is smooth and cuts right through camp, Joe's, and so on.  You can take easy long XC rides like Western Zippity to bring you down then back up to the cliffs.Trails in the google map of this trail (that I rode) include; Keesels, Joes, Western Zippity, Edge Loop, Front Side.The high point is the cliffs and ridges above you, and some of the trails that skirt the cliffs are super-fun, and a bit more  challenging. There are all day epics, to short loops around camp.Go ride here for a few days, 2-3 is optimal.",
    "directions": "It's a bit tricky getting to Bookcliffe's as it's a good drive out of Fruita.  The good news, is, you can get there straight out of town as follows. I'll add in specific directions later, but for your best bet, stop off in town at one of the Bike Shops.",
