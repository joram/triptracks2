    "description": "Red Willow Park Trails are over 34 km of paved multi-use trails extend to all areas of St. Albert. Users of all ages enjoy the trails in a variety of ways, including walking, cycling, in-line skating and running.   In winter, the trails on both sides of the Sturgeon River from Lions Park to Boudreau Bridge are swept. \nGoing West on the trails will eventually take you to the new Anthony Henday Drive connector and to a park being built.  More importantly, it is the East end of the new Lois Hole Centennial Provincial Park which was established on April 19, 2005, becoming the 69th provincial park in Alberta. \nThe park contains the former Big Lake Natural Area and an additional 302 hectares of Crown land, for a total of 1421 hectares. The lake makes up around 59 per cent of the park's total area.\nGoing east will take you to a kids water feature park.  There is all kinds of stuff to see & do.  \nA few Cappochinno bars in the downtown area will supply the noshments.\nCurrent conditions:",
    "directions": "Many access points in St.A.  Pretty much anywhere along the mighty Sturgeon River.  The easiest parking lot for non-residents is at the NE corner of St. Albert Trail (Hiway #2) and St. Anne/Sturgeon Roads in the old Visitor Center lot.  Other good ones are the parking lots across from St. Albert Place, the downtown Arts center.",
