    "description": "This was the route of the 2011 Spring Chicken Enduro hosted by the \rBeachburg Off-Road Cycling Association.  The route was a mix of \rdouble-track, dirt roads, pavement and single-track.   Lots of muddy \rhike-a-bike this early in the spring.  Plan on at least 4 or 5 hours to \rcomplete this ride, depending on the time of year.  A few sections \rcrossed private property (such as River Run Rafting), but the organizer \robtained permission for our event.  The route included sections in the \rvicinity of the \"Rapids-to-Rafters\" trails built and maintained by \rWilderness Tours Rafting.  They sell daily passes to access their trails.",
