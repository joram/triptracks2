    "description": "A relatively easy trail through rugged-appearing terrain that offers very rewarding panoramas and diverse scenery.\nApproximately 6.4 km round-trip, can be done in about 3-3.5 hrs at a moderate pace with time to enjoy.\nFrom the parking lot at Mt. Seymour Resort the trail is mostly a narrow path having some overlap with the ski runs.  After about 2 km there are some nice views from Brockton Point.  From there you're passing through sub-alpine meadows before emerging from the trees onto the mostly-bald top of 1st Pump Peak, the terrain of which is dotted with numerous minor peaks that cradle small bowls holding ponds or snow until late summer - we did the trail in late August and there were still isolated patches of snow here and there.\nFrom the top of 1st Pump there are beautiful panoramas of Vancouver and the Fraser Valley to the south, Indian Arm to the east, Garibaldi peaks to the North and the Island to the West.",
    "directions": "Cross the Second Narrows Bridge from Vancouver and take the Mount Seymour Parkway.  Turn left at Mt Seymour Road and follow it to the parking lot at the top.  At the north end of the parking lot there is a kiosk with a park map and the trailhead is just beyond.",
