    "description": "NTS Map: 083F09Note - This is not the Willmore Wilderness Area, which is north of Jasper.This is a good multi-purpose trail along the McLeod River with 2 campgrounds, a day use and even a small back-country campsite. It offers some short, but steep climbs and is a great mountain bike trail.  It is also great as a running trail.It can be busy on summer weekends but during the week days it is very quiet.  There is also a very good toboggan hill. In the spring the trails can get icy.Rail buffs may find the old trestle remnants just west of the park on the McLeod river interseting",
    "directions": "Look for the Park Signs on the west side of Edson on either the east or west-bound lanes of Hwy 16.  The park is about 6km south of town.Rail buffs may find the old trestle remnants on the McLeod river interseting.",
