    "description": "There is a short hike you can do located just a few kilometers north of Annapolis Royal.  The hike is located inside the Mickey Hill Pocket wilderness and consists of three interconnected trails.  These trails are short and suitable for all ages.\r\rThe picnic trail starts off in the parking lots and winds its way to the river with some suspended bridges and tables located quite close to the river.  The forest is a mixture of old growth evergreen and some deciduous trees located close to the river.  There are some large rocky outcrops with some of the outcrops having small opening you can crawl in.\r\rThe beach trail can also be accessed though the parking lot or at the end of the picnic trail.  The trail is quite short and leads to a very nice, sandy, beach on a lake.  The trail continues alongside the lake to the right of the beach and winds its way in a circle back to the main beach trail.  Just off of the middle of the beach trail is the start of ski trail.  This trail goes out into the forest and then loops back to the beach trail.\r\r",
    "directions": "Take the Annapolis Royal exit off highway 103.  Take highway 8 south and drive about 5km to the Mickey Hill Pocket Wilderness.\r",
