    "description": "A short exploration hike to an old mill site near New Glasgow.  I wasn\u2019t sure where the mill was when I set off from my car.  I reached the stream within 20 seconds and found lots of old car parts strewn on the bank.   I decided to walk downstream from this point as most of the elevation loss was coming up that way.  The brook is easy to follow and I did find an old dam of some kind way downstream close to a private residence bridge over the stream.  \n\nI left the stream and walked back upstream by following the road.  This time I went a little bit more upstream than my car and of course found the mill just above where the old car parts were.  Arghhhhh!  However, the mill has some beautiful walls and two intact windows and so was worth the detour.",
    "directions": "Highway 374.  Take East River West Side Road and turn on Millstream No 2 Road.  Go uphill to where it meets Millstream No 1 Rd.  Park here, go into the woods on your right and pass the abandoned cars to the mill site.",
