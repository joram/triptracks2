    "description": "This is the way to see two different waterfall on Gleason Brook.  The first one is about 10 feet and not much to look at while the second one is about 25 feet in total but it is in two parts.  The first part of the hike is easy and through a mature deciduous/evergreen forest but as you get closer to the falls there are a lot of deadfall to get through.  However the last fall is very nice and worth the fir needles that will end up down your shirt.",
    "directions": "Make you way to Upper Musquodoboit and continue past on highway 336 until you turn left on Dean Back Rd.  Drive until you cross over one branch of Gleason brook.  Follow this branch of the brook for 300m downstream until you meet the main branch.  Follow main branch upstream for about 1km to the second fall",
