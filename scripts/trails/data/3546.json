    "directions": "Head towards Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, east of Vancouver.  Parking can be found on Gagliardi Way, just north of where the high voltage power lines cross the road, on North Road, or at the University.  It is possible to use the public bus system to do drops, but those pins of yours are pretty good at pushing a bike up a hill as well.  Enjoy.",
