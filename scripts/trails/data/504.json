    "description": "NTS Map: 92J2  This is the most difficult of the Garibaldi hikes but well worth the effort. The trail is well marked and maintained but very steep, gaining 3600 ft in less than 6 km. From the trailhead, the trail begins its ascent immediately, although the steepest part is yet to come! After crossing the stream, you enter the forest and begin your climb. The forest is quite thick and gives up only occasional views. The trail switches back, following Wedgemount Creek which tumbles down the mountain via a series of waterfalls.When you finally emerge from the forest you find yourself scrambling on a steep, rocky slope through alpine meadows. A final push over the ridge and Wedgemont Lake, Wedge Mountain, and the glacier greet you with every bit of majesty that you might have come to expect from the BC Coast Mountains.There is a BC Mountaineering Club cabin here as well as places to pitch a tent if you are staying the night. The surrounding peaks and ridges beckon, and climbing opportunities abound.If you don't mind some hard work, this trail offers easy access and some of the most spectacular views you could hope for!",
    "directions": "Take Hwy 99 11.5 km north of Whistler. The turnoff is well marked on your right. You'll cross the BC Rail tracks and Green River. The road goes left after the river. At the next fork go right, and then left again on a logging road. The parking lot and trailhead are at the end of this road, about 2 km from the highway.",
