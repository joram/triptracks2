    "description": "This is a short hike to a beautiful and secluded and somewhat secret swimming hole.  The path takes you towards the river but you would never guess that just beyond those few trees lies a deep gorge incised with one 8ft waterfall and numerous smaller cascades.  The sun does reach the depth of the gorge most of the time so it?s quite cool and overtaken by a deep layer of moss.  The large fall sits upstream of the gorge and has a large pool at its base to swim in.  There is definitely some local use of this spot by the faint trail you can follow to the main fall.  The rest of the gorge is also well worth the short visit it will take you.",
    "directions": "Highway 347 just passed Meiklefield.  Turn on a dirt pull off area to the east of the highway about 500m before you see the JW McCulloch Rd if you are heading towards Sherbrooke.",
