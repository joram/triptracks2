    "description": "A nice little XC ski and bike area just South of Nakusp, Wensley Creek made for a nice place to get out of the truck and stretch my legs.  There are 2 main XC ski loops with a great little cabin in the middle.  Cutting through these double-tracks are a number of singletracks suitable for hiking, snow shoeing, and more adventurous biking.There are also a number of trails that spur off of these main trails, I investigated a few of them and found an odd little water filter shed or something, a road going steeply up a hill (I lost interest at that point), and a great singletrack making it's way down towards the highway presumably.  Also found some constructed trail features (skinneys, teeter, etc.) for those that heal fast (I don't)).Nice area, recommended to visit if you're in the 'hood.",
    "directions": "Easy to get to just off the main hiway southeast of town (#6) and turn North on Upper Brouse Rd and it is under 1.5km to the parking lot.",
