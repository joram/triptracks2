    "description": "Beginning at Songhees Point, walk along the Victoria waterfront to West Bay. The walkway is mostly level and is paved so it is wheelchair accessible. At all points along this walk there are views of the harbour. A nice walk if you?re stuck in the city or are unable to tackle more moderate hikes.",
    "directions": "From Downtown Victoria, cross the Johnson St. Bridge into Esquimalt. Turn Left on Songhees Road. There is a small amount of parking near the water. This is only one of several access points. Nearly every road between here and Head St. has an access point.",
