    "description": "This is a 11.4 K single- track loop that starts near the Colert beach and passes through a forested area with great views of Lake Minnewasta. Although there are some easy portions, this trail definitely requires an intermediate level of skill as there are many fairly steep climbs and descents with tight turns and narrow wooden bridges. The loop takes you onto a few quiet residential streets and then onto a community multi-use path that crosses a beautiful golf course. A must ride. There are additional portions of trails on this lop that can be accessed.",
    "directions": "Trail head is at the South end of Colert Rd. and marked with a large trail map sign.",
