    "description": "A short connector into the East Coast Trail that is suitable as either a starting point for longer treks of the ECT or a nice In-n-Out for a sample of the ECT.  This takes you to perfectly groomed trails and amazing lookouts where you will often see Whales frollicking off the coast.  \r\rIt has a few interesting features along it including 2 fantastic bridges over creeks and waterfalls.\r\rThis trail was brought to my attention by Elke @ Points East Guest Haus just up (North) the road a bit.  A great place to stay and a *very* knowledgeable lady on the ECT and Newfoundland Culture in general.\r\rInteresting side bar:  At the end of Satellite Road is the site of an old NORAD early DEW line installation.  Not much left except for some concrete footings.  Now the site is a Lions Club recreation facility.",
    "directions": "Hiway 20, about 20km North of St. John's, just North of Flatrock/South of Pouch (Pooch) Cove, look for Satellite Road on the East.  Drive down this road about 1km and look for a small (2-3 car) pullout on the right (South) side.  Trailhead is there and easy to find.",
