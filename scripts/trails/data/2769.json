    "description": "All other Mt Seymour postings on this site follow the route around to the east of Peak 1, to the Elsay Lake turnoff, and then up to Peak 1.\nThere is another, shorter, more spectacular route, straight up Peak 1, and then on to Peaks 2 and 3.\nI had resisted taking this route fearing it was difficult and treacherous. Took this route on Saturday Oct 14, 2006. It's no more difficult than the trail up from Peak 1 to 2, or even from 2 to 3. Also, no roots and rocks to hop over.\nI WOULD NOT HOWEVER VENTURE ON THIS ROUTE WHEN SNOW COVERED.",
    "directions": "Drive up to Mt Seymour, and follow the trail to Peak 1. Download the GPS data to find the turn off for the trail that leads straight up to Peak 1, rather than around the east side.",
