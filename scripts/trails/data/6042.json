    "description": "Not super technical trail, but a challenging hike. Good lookout points and great river access as you make your way up to the rock. We used the Fallway path to Gordon and Tama Falls, ultimately converging with Valley Way. Crossing a river, you can take Inlook Trail to Dome rock for a loop, and return by Kelton Trail (by that trail merge, you'll have climbed 1426 ft from the parking lot) to Sylvan Way. At the end, Sylvan will bring you across a mostly flat traverse back to the same lot (hang a left to cross back over the water again and walk through field to get there.)  On a sunny day with no wind, give yourself plenty of time to explore the falls and some time to catch some zzzz's by the rocks on Inlook trail.In springtime or high-water seasons, crossing a submerged rock path in the river is required to get to Inlook, so pack socks if you must, and a pole is helpful. Descent on Kelton is a knee-jarrer.",
    "directions": "From Gorham take HWY 2 to main trail lot [Appalachia] then follow the trails up.",
