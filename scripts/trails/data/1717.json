    "description": "This is the easiest trail in Golden Ears Provincial Park. It is an easy 1 hour (2.7 km) walk along Gold Creek to Lower Falls. The rocky beach about 20 minutes in is a beautiful spot to rest and relax. About halfway to the falls, part of the trail has been washed out and re-routed. If you stop at the bank of the creek and turn to look southwest, you get a great view of the mountains overlooking the creek.",
    "directions": "From Vancouver, take the Lougheed Highway (Hwy 7), and turn left onto Dewdney Trunk Road. Turn left on 232nd and then follow the signs to Golden Ears Provincial Park.",
