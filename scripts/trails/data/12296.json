    "description": "This is a fun day hike.Up BCMC first (steep!) Then continue on past the chalet and grizzly bear display, etc. to the entrance to Crown, Goat, etc.  Goat Mountain is a moderately difficult day hike. When combined with BCMC, it becomes challenging for the weekend hiker.  Great views from Goat and some fun challenging sections along the way.",
    "directions": "Park at the base of Grouse Mountain.  Start trail at Grind/BCMC gate.",
