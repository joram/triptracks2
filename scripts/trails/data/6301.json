    "description": "NTS Map 83C/6 (Sunwapta Peak)\r\rElevation gain: 1150m\rTrailhead: 1850m\rSummit: 3001m\rDistance is for a linear return trip.\r\rThis is a cross between a hike (first half) and an easy scramble up scree slopes (second half).  The views of surrounding peaks will not disappoint, even if going only as high as the treeline.\r\rFrom the Tangle Falls parking area, cross the Icefields Parkway and look for the trail to Wilcox Pass on the right side of the falls.  This is probably the most dangerous part of the hike, as motorists apparently aren't aware of the 50km/h speed zone.  This trail is described  here.\r\rAfter a kilometre on the trail, it comes alongside Tangle Creek again (5791217N, 481298E, UTM 11N, NAD83).  At this point look for a dry, rocky drainage on the opposite side.  A piece of blue flagging and a worn trail down the bank will help pinpoint this spot.  Cross the creek and pick your way up the drainage.  After a few hundred metres, a trail will develop on the left hand side of the steepening drainage - this is the side you want to go up.  This trail should be easy to follow to the treeline, where good views are already available of Wilcox Pass and it's surrounding peaks.\r\rAbove the treeline, start up alpine meadows which soon change to scree slope.  While no trail exists, the high point of the ridge is visible as you go up the slope.  Head up in a gentle arc from left to right, keeping the drainage to the right.  Once on top, many peaks of the Columbia Icefields and Brazeau range will be visible - even the repeater on top will not spoil the views.\r\rCAUTION: While the ridge is quite broad on top, do not stray too close to the NE side.  A steep slope of snow and ice drops off this edge.\r\rOn the return, keep on the same side of the drainage until you pick up the trail again at treeline.  As a landmark, keep in line with the ridge coming off Mt. Wilcox on the lower scree slope and alpine meadow.  One variation is to continue along the ridge towards Nigel Peak, before dropping into the valley to meet the trail coming down from Wilcox Pass.  This would add to the overall time and distance of the route.\r\rAs this is in the icefields region, be prepared for any weather, any time of the year.  A warm sunny day can turn cold and wet during the course of a hike.  Ensure you pack rain gear and warm clothing.\r\r",
