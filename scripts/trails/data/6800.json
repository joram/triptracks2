    "description": "Killington Peak is one of 5 4k Ftrs in Vermont state.  I took the Shelburne Pass trail which is the longest path to reach to the 4k footer, Killington Summit because I wanted to stop by Pico Peak as well in a day hiking.  Trail is well maintained and it's easy to follow.  At the first shelter, we take right to get to Pico Peak Summit (3957 ft). Then, return to the shelter (Pico Camp area), go  right on Shelburne Pass trail further South.  This trail eventually merges to Long Trail.  Keep going on Long trail, you'll reach to Cooper Shelter which looks really nice.  It is made by rock, not by woods.  At this point, we took the Killington Spur trail to get to the summit.(4235 ft).",
    "directions": "From the intersection of Rt 100 and Rt4, go on Rt 4 on West about 1.8 miles or so.  Parking Lot for Shelburne Pass Trail is located at your left side.  There is a small green sign of Shelburne Pass Trail in front of the Parking Lot.",
