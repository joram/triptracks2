    "description": "This is an alternative to the traditional front route to the top of Sulphur Mountain (which starts half way up the east side of the mountain from the base of the Sulphur Mountain Gondola).This route starts at the valley bottom, so it is quite a bit longer, and goes up the west side. It utilizes a road that was used for the original construction of the top station. Time and distance include the return trip.Today, there was snow at higher elevations... but then again it is November 11, in a mild year!",
    "directions": "Start at the \"Cave & Basin\" which is at the end of Cave Avenue, in Banff.",
