    "description": "Foret Ouareau offers a number of trails varying in length and difficulty. On the eastern side of the park, the Sentier Nationale leaves the parking lot and welcome cabin at highway 125, just south of Notre-Dame-de-la-Merci, and climbs easily but steadily towards the several peaks. The lookouts provide wonderful views of the surrounding hills and forests of Lanaudiere.",
    "directions": "From Montreal, follow hwy 25 north, continuing on hwy 125 past Chertsey to a well-marked parking lot and information cabin just before Notre-Dame-de-la-Merci. From Montreal, about 1h20.",
