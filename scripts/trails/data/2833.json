    "description": "Located in Quebec's Gaspesie National Park, this look off route is located directly opposite the interpretive center along Route 299. 1.6K each way, it's rated as intermediate, due to its moderate gain in altitude (200M) and its 1.5 hour duration.\r\n\r\nThis is also a summer path which continues up Mont Albert past the look off platform, but in Winter, the extended path is closed. The look off gives you views back over the Gite du Mont Albert and the McGerrigle Mountains to the East.\r\n\r\nI couldn't believe that it took almost 1.5 hours for us to climb and descend a 1.6K trail. Mind you, we did take in the view at the top for a little while.\r\n\r\nIt's a great little hike if you don't have a lot of time to invest in bigger undertakings. Great for the day you arrive, or something for the morning you depart from your park stay. It's a warm up that packs a great punch in the views.\r",
