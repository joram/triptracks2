    "description": "The trail is unique for a summit route in that it is a loop; the trail ascends to the summit and then makes a circle along the ridge to the trail again. The trail wanders for a mile through second-growth timber before entering the wilderness. You'll reach the junction after 1.8 miles and it is rather steep to get here. Take the right path for the more gradual route along the ridge. The summit yields views of Hood Canal and numerous Olympic peaks.",
    "directions": "From Hoodsport, west 9 miles on Lake Cushman Road to Forest Service Road 24. Turn left and drive 3 miles to the trailhead on the right side of the road.\r",
