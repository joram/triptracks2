    "description": "A difficult hike that is easy to navigate along single track leading to the base of Dunn Peak. A great spot for an over night though can be completed in a day. The hike takes you through wooded trails, open ground and offers fantastic views of the mountains, many streams and ponds as you hike in the valley. The trail is very very wet, has a multitude of roots, trees and rocks to scale.Towards the end of the trail to the ridge where you can see the other side, you will have to jump and scale huge boulders. Extreme care should be taken to prevent an injury and shouldn't be attempted alone. The is no cell service in this area from start to finish and for a distance down the road. This hike is best done in September or October. In the Spring it is too wet and during the summer, the bugs will drive you back.Regardless of when you hike it, proven waterproof boots are needed and a sock change is recommended for the route back. If you go in the fall, enjoy the blueberries that grow everywhere on the sides of the trail.",
    "directions": "From Kamloops direction drive into Barriere taking your second right onto Barriere lakes Rd for approx 15 KM's. Just before the paved road turns into a gravel road, turn left onto North Barriere Lake - Harper Creek FSR. Continue up this long road until it stops into a small square clearing. The trail head is on the left with a small sign that says \"trail\"! You will need a 4 x 4 truck as the top section is very rocky with washed out places.",
