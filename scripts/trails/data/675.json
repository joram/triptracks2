    "description": "NTS Map:92F12, NTS Map92F5. Short but sweet.  There is big elevation gain over a short distance. The trail is in great shape with bridges over all creeks.  Baby Bedwell lake is spectacular with several brand new tent platforms. Hikers can also continue to Bedwell Lake a few Km farther. There can be lots of snow, even on June 10th.",
    "directions": "From Campbell River, take Hiway 28 West to the bridge over Upper Campbell Lake/Buttle Lake.  Do not cross the bridge, but take the road down the East side of Buttle for 41km to Jim Mitchell.\nFollow Buttle Lake road south to Jim Mitchell Lake road which is on the left just after the Thelwood Creek Bridge.  Follow this dirt road about 7 km to the trailhead.",
