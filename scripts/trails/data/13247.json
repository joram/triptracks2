    "description": "This is one of those falls I explored for a long time ago and forgot to post.  I used to have a pict on panoramio but that site closed down.From a logging road, make your way towards the stream and boggy area to the south side of the road.  Follow the edge of the bog as the middle is quite wet.  You will cross one branch of Middle Brook but donate follow it up.  Rather continue circling the bog to another branch located approx at;  45\u00b032'0.34\"N,  62\u00b014'41.95\"W.  Follow that branch for a few hundred feet to a nice 30ft fall",
    "directions": "Highway 4 near Marshy Hope.  turn on Rossfield Rd.  At intersection at; N45.53713 W62.26321, turn left and go down hill until tyou cross Middle Brook...follow it upstream to the fall",
