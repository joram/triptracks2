    "description": "Starting with a pretty demanding climb and ending with some of the best singletrack with optional nutso downhill stunts in the area, this trail gets 6 thumbs up.  \nWe really had our doubts after 5km of grunting up the hill, but the quality of the trail build on the way down, along with the natural and un-natural stunts built in, and great, gnarly, twisty, singletrack, made us all believers (and thanking the forest gnomes who built this unsung gem).  You start with climbing 224m in 5km, so only 5% *average*, but there were some downs in there which add to the up % and some of the trail is a little soft, so it takes more work than you might hope for.  ALL rideable though if you have the legs (and the XC bike)\nOnce you are at the top, it is super fun, flowey, mostly rolling downhills for 3+ km until some very steep, sometimes loose, optionally crazy downhill.  A very cool, huge slab 'o limestone is an interesting feature.\nThere are a few walls, skinneys, berms and a '59 DeSoto (that's just a guess) adding to the action along the trail.",
    "directions": "Drive to the town of Exshaw, about 14 km East of Canmore on hiway 1A, take the first road (most Westerly) into town and go North up to the recycling center.  Look to the left and you'll see a small gravel parking lot.  Park there, the locals probably won't tow your car from there.\nPack up and ride (NO, WALK !!) across the small foot bridge to the first road, turn left and follow the road up, around to the left (West) of the construction (Fall 2010) and up the trail.",
