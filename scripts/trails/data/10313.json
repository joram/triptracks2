    "description": "This is a short walk to an overlook of Southeast Brook Falls. Unfortunately you only get one real look at the falls because of fences. Also there are the ever-present power lines to deal with. However, it is a nice diversion from driving and is generally quiet.",
    "directions": "Trailhead is on the east side of Route 430 about 10km north of Wiltondale, in Gros Morne N.P., well signed, good parking.",
