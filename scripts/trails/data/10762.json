    "description": "Jean-Guy on the rocks starts off with a steep section with some drops and small jumps  then about a 1/3 of the way in the speed picks up with more jumps and the end of the second section joins up with SLF. At that point there is a combination of a small gap jump to a step up to medium large gap jump with limited landingn area. The last part of the trail starts when you cross the power line and the bottom part has a lot of berms with the end of it marked by a wooden jump ramp that connects to a drop that connects to a left side hip jump. The trail is mainly west and south exposed, so it usually dries out quickly in the winter and spring, but also becomes subject to wind which may create deadfall in the spring.",
    "directions": "Trail head is at 6.5 kms on the West side of Moose Mountain road. The exit is at Ing?s mine road about 3.5km in and you need to get on that road and go south to the Ing?s Mine parking lot for retrieval. The parking is located right next to the trail head and is easy to recognize as it is the only flat spot with a guard rail between 6km and 7km and the east side has a view of Calgary.This is the same parking location used to access Race of Spades trail.",
