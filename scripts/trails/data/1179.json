    "description": "A relatively short (3k each way) hike up a closed road to a fire lookout / antenna convention.  400m elevation gain in 3km means it is a steep walk/ride up to the summit where you will find great views of the east side of the Rockies and possibly Abraham Lake (it was pretty hazy when I was there).  Good place to take non-masochists and/or old people (like me).NTS Map: 083C09Elevation Gain: 400 m (1,312 ft).",
    "directions": "Get to Rocky Mountain House (west of Red Deer), keep going west to Nordegg, grab a bite at the Coal Miner Cafe in the museum.  Go 1km or so further west of main Nordegg turn (south) and turn to the North up the road to the Shunda Hostle.  Take the right of the Y at the hostle and follow the road a further 5.1 rocky km up to a closed gate and parking lot",
