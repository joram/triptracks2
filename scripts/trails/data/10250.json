    "description": "Three Sisters Pass sits between the south end of Lawrence Grassi and Big Sister.  It is an interesting half-day / 600 m elevation hike/scramble to a grassy meadow with Big Sister towering 500 meters above.  There are views down to Canmore but the reason to be here is to ponder the huge expanse of cirque east of Big Sister!The trail heads first into a dry drainage on the east side of the highway, and then is fairly easy to track ? lots of options on either side of the creek.  No problems with route finding but if you use the GPS track, you?ll find the main trail was used mostly on the downward track.  If the water is low, enjoy the slabs instead of the trail.  About 1.6 km in, at the way point marked TspCanyon (see N51 00.922 W115 22.579), there is a narrow wet section with slippery slabs.  We had no trouble coming down this but you might want to bypass this by heading high on the right (south) side of the canyon and following a faint trail through the trees.The finish is pretty sweet ? just when you think your going to be broiling while slogging up scree to gain the pass, you come around a bend to the left and see a stand of trees.  The trail heads into these and you fallow a shady zigzagged trail right to the pass!Once on the pass (elevation 2277 m), wander off to the left on a faint trail to gain a small promontory and then look back at Big Sis.  NB: This trail might not be a good option in the spring with run off and snow.Added June 2014NB: Since the flooding of 2013, this trail has changed from a moderate trail to a gigantic sea of rocks. The trail was not always obvious, and we had to cross the creek constantly to find the easiest way up. We couldn't get very far (1.5 hours up) due to snow, so don't know how the rest of the trail looks.",
    "directions": "Drive the Spray Lakes Road Hwy 742 past the Goat Creek parking lot to a point where the canal begins to widen into Goat Pond.  Park in a short loop off the main road - see GR128520 or N51 00.621 W115 23.490.  Your elevation here is 1680 m.  Walk south on the road about 75 m to reach the drainage.",
