    "description": "This is an aggressive hike (10km return) with some spectacular views at the top. The start of the path isn't clearly marked but once above the tree line the destination is quite obvious. \nThe fire lookout is manned during the summer and there was a family of Martin at the top by the Lookout when I was up.",
    "directions": "Take the Forestry Trunk road (734) and take it north to Ram Falls.  Travel past the RV camping site and take you next left west. Travel 5 km to a parking area.  From here I walked west about 200 m past the HJ Ranch and took one of the Horse trails on the right and proceeded up the hill. \nThinks aren't well marked but once you get above the tree line you can see a clear path to the lookout.",
