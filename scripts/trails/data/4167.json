    "description": "A 1.4 mile hike round trip. It is very nice all year round, but there is no shade so plan to start a bit on the early side if you don't want to be hiking in the beating sun. It took me and my father about an hour to an hour and a half, but some people find the hike a little harder.\nGorgeous views from the lookout.\nWould definitely do it again.",
    "directions": "From Kalakaua Avenue, turn left onto Monserrat Ave at Honolulu Zoo and continue to Diamond Head Road. The entrance to the Monument will be on the right.",
