    "description": "NTS Map: 082G08\nCarbondale Fire Lookout\nElevation Gain: 457 m (1,500 ft).\nDistance: 8 kms round trip\nTime: 3 hours\nHere's a short hike in the Beaver Mines area that's great for the shoulder season. Follow the trail up and enjoy the fantastic 360-degree views of the Castle Crown Wilderness. \nNote: This is an active fire lookout. We did this hike on the Victoria Day Long weekend in May 2003 and already there was a fire warden stationed there. After saying hello, the lady fire warden informed us that she was using the snow around the building for her water supply. So be sure to say hello before trampling around the premises!\n-\tT. Helwig\nPS Note the snow on May 19th, bring along those gaitors!",
