    "description": "A series of short urban forest type trails located in the municipality of Coquitlam that are great for that day that you want to take a short stroll or don't have a lot of time. Two small lakes - Mundy and Lost Lake are located in the park. Trails are well marked and there are no major elevation gains in the park - part of a greenway project linking the Fraser river and Coquitlam Center and Eagle Ridge",
    "directions": "There are number of trails entrances from either Como Lake or Mariner Way - park and just start walking or riding.",
