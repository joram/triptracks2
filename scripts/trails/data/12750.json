    "description": "This quick hike offers a great view of Fulford Harbour. The trail is relatively steep at times, but overall, it's easy and well maintained.",
    "directions": "From Fulford Harbour, drive south along Morningside Road until you reach a wide clearing with a large community Postbox. Park your vehicle here and walk up the private Reginald Hill Road (pedestrians are permitted) for a few minutes. The trail begins along a gravel road which heads east. You'll see a signpost that marks your route near the road's chain-linked gate.",
