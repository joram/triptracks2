    "description": "This is an easy hike to a nice waterfall that is close to Halifax.   The Pockwock watershed is the water source for the west side of HRM.   The river that leaves the lake is not in the protected area so you can visit and swim there!The trail is the Old Pockwock Road and it descends a moderate hill.  At the bottom of the Hill, turn to the right and enter the woods....the fall is just a few metres in but well hidden by the forest.",
    "directions": "In Hammonds Plain.  Take Pockwock Rd and park at the sharp bend and follow the dirt road to the fall at  44\u00b045'23.64\"N,  63\u00b052'6.63\"W",
