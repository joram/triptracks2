    "description": "This trail leads along the Memaloose Creek through a valley until you eventually cross the creek and start gaining elevation and head up towards Poland Lake. A section about 30 minutes before the lake has been re-routed so make sure to pay attention where the new spur is flagged. Some blowdown is expected on this trail but the trail is well-marked and in good condition. Poland Lake has nice clear meadows, an outhouse, a fire pit, several good camp spots and great fishing opportunities. Makes for a solid trip in any season.",
    "directions": "Drive East from Hope on Highway 3 until you reach Allison Pass. There is a yellow gate on the South side of the road which leads to a highway shed area. Walk through this area towards the forest and you will see a marker for the trail.",
