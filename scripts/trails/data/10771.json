    "description": "I had been a few times to Eagle's Nest in Bedford for the view and rock climbing.  On this day, I decided to visit the rest of the huge park that lies at the foot of the Nest.Admiral Cove Park is another hidden gem in the heart of the city.  The rest of the park sees few visitors and there are a couple of unofficial trails to follow.  One of them leads you to the sea shore.  Within a few minutes you come out to a good size cliff of about 45ft into the ocean.  At its base lies the (copyright pending) Bedford Monolith.  a huge 30ft high single standing stone by the side of the cliffs.  almost makes you want to jump from the cliffs to the top of it..almost.  Maybe a cool thing to come back to and climb.the rest of the hike can be done on the seashore ( I recommend it) and is quite a nice coastal hike in the middle of the city.   Blue mussels and barnacle abound everywhere and it seems people are using the seashore for some bonfires from time to ti,e. I tried to cross through the park to come back to my car?.big mistake?wind damage is throughout the forest and makes it incredibly hard to go in a straight line at all.",
