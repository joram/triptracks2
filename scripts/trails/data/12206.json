    "description": "I had some time to kill near Bridgewater and I had noticed a fall on a topographic map on the Lahave river called Keddys Fall.   The way to get to it is to walk on a rail to trail section for about 5 minutes.  then you cut across the woods once you hear the roar of the river.  Unfortunately, it isn't much of a fall at 2-3ft but since it doesn't take long to get there it's ok nonetheless.",
    "directions": "Highway 10 north of Bridgewater.  turn on salmon Run Rd and park at the rails top trails.  Head in a northern direction",
