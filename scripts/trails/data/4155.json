    "description": "Great snowshoe up to Rawson Lake, about 300m of elevation gain. A really nice, varied trail, winding through a spruce tree forest, across a  minor stream (bridged), over a hill and down into an extremely scenic lake. \nWe were up on a clear sunny day with excellent visibilty facing a larger lake than I  realized and a magnificent view of the mountain complete with cirque and col. Had to take 3 shots of the camera to fit it all in.\nThe snow was really nice, but take a step 1/2 meter off of the trail and you're up to your shins in snow, even wearing the big Faber Snowshoes.\nA very worthwhile hike in any season, rated for a beginners, not very difficult at all.",
    "directions": "Take exit 118 from Hwy 1 (Trans Canada) near Morley (east of Canmore) and follow #40 south into Peter Lougheed Prov. Park. Follow road past Pocaterra Hut and turn left into Upper Kananaskis Lake parking lot (just after William Watson Lodge). Real easy to find. The trailhead begins here which is situated on Upper Kanaskis Lake (another photo op).",
