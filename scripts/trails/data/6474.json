    "description": "Nice and easy trail loop through a mixed forest to the edge of the Highlands Plateau.  Going counter clockwise, the western leg has many forks, just keep choosing the route that basically heads South.  You will hit Davies rd -- just go left.  Then take the right fork when the road splits.  The southern most point of this trail looks out over Thetis lake park and Victoria.  It is a good place for bird watching.  The trail, not on this GPS track, continues South through Thetis lake park (see \"Thetis to Munns rd\" trail).",
    "directions": "The main trail head is on Munns Rd. near the parking lot for Mt Work 48deg31.011N 123deg 29.445W.  Another access point at the end of Stuart Mtn Rd at 48deg29.900N 123deg29.661W.",
