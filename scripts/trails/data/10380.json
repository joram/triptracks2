    "description": "Callaghan Country is a privately operated area just south of the Whistler Olympic Park, south of Whistler BC. \r\rThe main road running through it (open to cars when there is no snow) runs from Hway 99, south of Whistler to Callaghna Provincial Park (it is the \"Real Life\" cross country skiing trail in winter) and is well marked as Whistler Olympic Park and Callaghan Lake Provincial Park.\r\rCallaghan Country has lots of cross-country skiing and snowshoeing, with showshoeing access to the bottom of Alexander Falls, and to the Whistler Olympic Park.\r\rThe subject trail is apparently a new snowshoeing trail, not yet even marked on maps (see the red handwritten trail on the attached map).\r\rIt goes through medium density evergreen forest, with clearings and small lakes, with total ascent of 285 m. over the 4 kms west (the route back is on the road, and literally all downhill).\r\rYou can detour via Alexander Falls, but I suggest you save that for another trip, due to the climbs down and up.\r",
    "directions": "South of Whistler, turn left at the \"Whistler Olympic Park, Callaghan Provincial Park\" road. Drive approx 9 kms and just before the sharp hairpin turn to Whistler Olympic Park, turn left over the single lane bridge (\"Callaghan Country\"), drive approx 300 m and park. You'll find the ticket office, pay your $8 for snowshoeing ($14 for cross country skiing), get a map, ask for directions and enjoy your day.",
