    "description": "NTS Map: 082O01If we're lucky enough to get some snow hanging around inside Calgary, I strongly suggest you look at this trip.  Right in the middle of town, easy to get to, FREE, and great scenery all make this an enjoyable way to spend a couple hours.  There are many sections of trails to take so you can make your day as long or short as you desire.Click to see the Shaganappi Brochure.All other City of Calgary XC areas can be seen here.Some other information on Calgary area XC skiing is here.",
    "directions": "Take Bow Trail west from downtown Calgary, turn right (North) on 26 st SW, and 1 block later you're there.",
