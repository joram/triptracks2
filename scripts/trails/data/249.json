    "description": "The trail begins from behind Farrel Rd located behind the Revelstoke Railway Museum. The trail is extremley well marked and follows moderate incline as it winds through beutiful subalpine and alpine forest. Durring early August meadows of wild flowers can be found along the trail and at the summit. Although August is the best time of the year to veiw the various wild flowers both fall and winter offer their own rewards. The fall offers beutiful colors and cool dry tempatures. Winter is an excellent time of the year to snowshoe through the park with the chance of spying some of the Cariboo that use the park as a wintering ground.",
