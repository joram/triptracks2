    "description": "Excellent short and easy hike to a couple of sea caves along the Bay of Fundy.  Lots of potential for minerals hounding too!   Watch out for the tides as they will come up right to the cliff face leaving no beach to walk on",
    "directions": "Aylesford Exit.  Turn on Victoria Harbour Rd and up the north mountain.  Keep going straight as the road deteriorates.  The road leads all the way to a beach.  Walk east!",
