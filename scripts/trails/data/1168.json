    "description": "NTS Map:92F13 This trail is 13km in length, one-way, gaining 600m in elevation. You pass through thick forest (beautiful big trees to gaze at) and a couple creeks to cross. The trail is very-well maintained and quite popular as it leads to Landslide Lake which is quite breathtaking. It's turquoise and crystal-clear, formed by the meltwater from the snowpacks on Mt. Colonel Foster (who,by the way, was one of the first guys to climb Mt. Robson). You can see where a big avalanche in '46 caused part of Mt. CF to fall into the lake, wiping out all the trees and vegetation on its way down. Really, it's gorgeous. There are 2 backcountry campsites on the way there (one at 8km, one at 11km) (no facilities exc. pit toilets and bear cache) because no camping allowed at Landslide Lake. I did it as a day hike (light packs, so 4hrs oneway) and it was great, but doing an overnighter would be fantastic too.",
    "directions": "Follow Hwy. 28 west from Campbell River towards Gold River.  You'll see the sign for the trailhead. Park your vehicle right there.",
