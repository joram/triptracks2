    "description": "This is a shorty but a goody.  Close to Dollar Lake Provincial Park, a beautiful 20ft waterfall is hidden...except for the faint trail that leads to it which infers that some people know about it but wont share its location.  The forest is quite typical for this area and the rocks on either side of the stream are super slippery and are kind of like slate.",
    "directions": "Highway 212 to Dollar Lake Provincial Park.  there is a short dirt road on the north side of the highway at N44 56.628 W63 19.654.  Follow it and enter the wood following the faint trail to the stream and fall.",
