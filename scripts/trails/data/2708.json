    "description": "NTS Map: 92J7.  Nairn Falls is an awesome waterfall just 20 minutes from Whistler and provides an excellent spot to stretch the legs if coming down from the Joffre area.  The walk to the falls is a short 1.5 kms (one way).  The trail is very well maintained and easy to follow.  The area around the falls is fenced off and the main viewpoint is on a platform.  We saw the falls in September after months of no rain and they were still awesome.  After a good rain storm the falls would mind blowing.  Just be careful not to slip on the rocks.  Car camping is available here and makes a great base camp to explore the beautiful surrounding area.",
    "directions": "Take highway 99 north and in about 20 minutes from Whistler make a right.  The entrance to the park is well signed.",
