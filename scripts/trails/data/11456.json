    "description": "Bone Collector is a great downhill run in Savona , outside Kamloops BC. a 7 k Switchback climb with forestry road gets you to the trailhead. It is a great Shuttle for the downhill riders and there is also a beautiful switchback forestry road road climb for the cross country riders that prefer a loop!",
    "directions": "Shuttle: on the west side of savona you cross the bridge and after 1km you will reach the Sabiston Creek rd. Turn right here and follow the road for 7.4 k to the trail head.If you prefer the cross country loop, you turn right just after the bridge( savona station road) and follow this road to the cemetetry. Park at the cemetetry as the bone collector appropriately spits you out at the cemetry at the end! Bike to the highway and turn right on the highway. 1 km further turn right onto sabiston creek road and follow the 7.4 k and 600m+ vertical climb through 8 large switchbacks to the trailhead. Beautiful viewpoints en route . Motivation. If you reach the cattleguard there are 4 switchbacks left and a viewpoint on the right. If you reach Smith creek sign you passed the Bone collector trailhead by a 100m.",
