    "description": "This is a very scenic trail that is steep, and requires some moderate boulder climbing in some places. Take as much water as you can carry (1 gallon recommended). The last part of the trail (between Cathedral Peak and La Cumbre Peak) can get over grown and \"bush whacking\" may be required in some places.",
    "directions": "Start at the end of Tunnel Road and use the first part of Tunnel trail until it crosses the creak (may not be passable after a big rain!)",
