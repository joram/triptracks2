    "directions": "Start at the Grouse Mountain parking lot and head East on the Baden Powell.  (alternatively, park at the top of Skyline Drive and make your way up to the Baden Powell).  After crossing the bridge over Mosquito Creek, follow the path to the left that leads to the old dam (5 min or so).  Now head back down and follow the BP up by the water tower and look for a sign that says \"Old Grouse Mountain Highway, 50 min.\"  Follow this trail up keeping a keen eye on the orange ribbons as there are lots of detours due to blown down trees.  After about an hour of slogging uphill ducking under and over trees, you finally arrive at the destination; a nice spot on Mosquito Creek to stop for lunch.  Now retrace your steps back down.",
