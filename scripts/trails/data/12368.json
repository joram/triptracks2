    "description": "This trail starts at Peers Creek Trailhead. Cross the footbridge across the creek (not the horse trail).  The trail takes several km on an old logging road.  It's pretty overgrown and more like a trail than a road.  It's quite beautiful.  then you reach the first camp with a toilet (open air).  The trail starts steeply climbing then until you reach ~ 8 km - Manson's Ridge area.  There is a lookout to the left of the trail but it is limited.  Some flat (potential camp sites around 8 km mark)When we went, the trail was very well marked, but more trail tape than blazes.   There are some blazes... and km markers with the Heritage Trail logo if you notice them.  our GPS tracks include a bit of off-trail travel as we were informed that there are immense views in most directions.  Indeed it is very beautiful up there.  There was still some old snow up there Jun 5, 2016, but not much.  Snow travel started at Manson's Ridge (~1500 metres elevation).",
    "directions": "Directions to the trailhead are on the Hope Mountain website.  Highway 5 from Hope, Exit 183, follow the FSR road around to the left - there are multiple signs indicating directions to the trailhead.",
