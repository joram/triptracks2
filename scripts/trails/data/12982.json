    "description": "This is the end result of finding a white spot on sat imagery  in the upper reaches of the East Branch Folly River.  I had spotted those in winter but had to bide my time for spring as the logging road leading to within 500m of the potential fall is about 8km long.  I wouldn't mind doing it on snowshoes but I wasn't sure there was anything to see.The road is a bit rough put passable.  Then enter the forest using the old skidded track aiming for the waterfall.  The forest near the river at least hasn't been cut down and there are some really nice mature evergreen.  The top fall is mostly a rapid while the lower fall plunges a good 15ft or more with rock walls on either sides.  The pool at the bottom looks super inviting for a swim except in late April.",
    "directions": "Highway 4 towards Wentworth.  Before Folly Lake, turn right on Stevens Rd and follow my gps track to an area about 600m from the fall.  Leave your car and make your way to N45\u00b0 32.102' W63\u00b0 29.741'.",
