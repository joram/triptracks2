    "description": "Also starting from Ribbon Creek parking lot this trail offers some loops and an In&Out section that is all gently uphill on the way out, so you can ski until you're tired then turn around and coast back down.  Good scenery and it passes through the base of Nakiska Ski area, and up some great back routes into the hills.  Not all trails are track-set, but those who want something a little more adventurous, this is it!.  And for those that can't live without ready access to Espresso, this trail goes right past  the Nakiska Day lodge and optionally the mid-mountain lodge.\nThe route is well signed and all maps have the little 'You are here' rivet installed.  The only route finding needed is through the most populous area ironically, you have to look across the Nakiska base area to see the next couple marker signs.\nOnce you cross through Nakiska, you ski under a lift, then you will come to a 4-way intersection.  Going left (NorthWest)gets you on to the trail to Marmot Basin trail and Skogan Pass in 1.3km.  From this next Tee, 2.7km of up gets you up Marmot to the Nakiska mid-mountain lodge, or turning right (North) opens up a multitude of advanced trails and loops on the way to Skogan Pass.  There is about 10km of loops and trails between you and Skogan, so it gives you a lot of flexibility in length.  \nRibbon has some of the better early season snow.  On the drive out we saw all brown grass and dirt on the side of Hiway 1, but Ribbon area was nicely white.",
    "directions": "Drive West of Calgary on the TransCanada Highway #1 to Hiway 40 (Kananaskis Trail) (about 60km from the lights at Calgary Olympic Park) and then go South about 25km to the well-signed Nakiska / Ribbon Creek turn.  Go up the road a km or less and follow the signs to Ribbon Creek.  Park in the furthest lot (past the hostel & picnic shelters).",
