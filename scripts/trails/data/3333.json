    "description": "The trail to Rae Glacier is accessed from the Elbow Pass day use area. Take the wide hiking trail up to the very, very popular Elbow Lake. It?s less than 1.5 km. and ~150m. gain in altitude so you?ll see families of all ages and sizes along with the campers, fishermen, bikers and horses. At the lake follow the path through the camp sites then along the south side of lake heading roughly east until you reach the creek. From here it is ~2.5 km. and ~400m. gain to glacier. Follow creek south, upstream, and ascend up the rib to a nice viewpoint. The trail now descends back to creek where you stay on the right side. When the creek veers left stay straight, you?ll see the trail unless it?s snowy. You are ascending again, just keep right at the paths fork and soon the glacier will appear. Look back behind you. Wow!Now here?s the sad part. 10 or 11 so years ago Rae Glacier was thick and filled the whole cirque, see Gillean Daffern?s ?Kananaskis Country Trail Guide? hike #110 for a photo. Today the glacier has receded so far as to be just a blotch on the mountain slope, see photos above. We thoroughly enjoyed this hike with its great views and spectacular mountain vistas but, if you?re looking for K-Country?s most easternmost glacier, you will be disappointed.",
