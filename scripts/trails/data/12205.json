    "description": "Bizarre and beautiful capture the essence of Bryce Canyon.  The Queen's Garden and Navajo Loop is one of a few options that will take you around the fabulous hoodoos.  More of a walk 'n' gawk than a hike.  The long grade out is the only real element of difficulty.We took in a sunset and sunrise at Inspiration Point -- well worth the effort.",
