    "description": "I had seen a description of this hike on a provincial trail website.  I was in the area and decided to check it out.  The memorial trail are not really well signed.  The only sign you will find at the back of the park for a hiking trail is really the rail to trails that runs behind New Minas (which part of it is paved).  So I ended up finding pieces of trails which normally I wouldn't write about.  However there is one distinguishable feature of this trail system which in my opinion makes this trail worthy of a post.  The trail is now home to a frisbee-based 18 hole \"golf\" course.",
    "directions": "Highway 1 to New Minas.  Look for signs to the Memorial park close to a street called Minas warehouse Rd.",
