    "description": "Sacacomie Lodge is one of my favorite. The hotel is beautiful, it has a rustic and cozy look and have an outstanding terrace facing the lake with a view that is totally fascinating. Have your favorite drink there, mine is a Ricard. \nThe Sacacomie lake is awesome; surrounded by mountains and decorated with many islands, you will find peace-of-the-mind there as there are no motor boat on the lake. \nCanoeing on the lake is fabulous, you can have a picnic on many islands and there is event a nice flat rock to update you sun tan. See waypoint \"RochePLATE\".",
