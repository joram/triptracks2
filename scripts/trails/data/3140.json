    "description": "A very nice trail in the heart of Stoney Swamp, and part of a much larger network of trails in west Ottawa's portion of the greenbelt.  About a third of the way down the trail is a very small branch (see GPS file) that leads to the edge of a secluded little marshland lake where many blue heron nests can be seen in the distance, usually populated with many young in mid June.  You'll also find many wild purple iris flowers growing near the waters edge in the spring.  The trails are best done in late spring / early summer once the ground has dried up and the black flies have vanished, but they can also be enjoyed in the winter months while cross country skiing.  Mountain biking is not permitted on this portion of the trail.",
    "directions": "Park at the P11 parking lot on Hunt Club road, west of the 416 / east of Moodie Dr.  An Alternate entrance (not indicated in GPS file) is the P8 parking lot on Moodie Dr.",
