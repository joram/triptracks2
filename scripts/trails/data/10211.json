    "description": "A short steep hike into some spectacular mountain lakes in the alpine. Another 1/2 hour past the lake will take you to a couple of  summits with endless Monashee views. The trail to Twin Lakes is very clearly marked and obvious. The elevation gain is 462m from the parking lot (picnic table, outhouse, and bugs) to Twin Lakes. The parking lot sits at 1800m so about half of the hike is in alpine and sub alpine terrain. We went in Aug of 2011 and caught some nice wild flowers but apparently everything was a month behind because of the La Nina winter/spring. Energy permitting you should definitely try to ascend to the saddle of Twin Lakes and gain an amazing view of a huge lake network to the east which also has great camping possibilities. It's a little messy descending to this lake network but certainly worth it if you can do it. There's no trail that we found.No amenities will be found at Twin Lakes other than what we saw in the parking lot. Plenty of fast moving streams are to be found (at least in Aug) once you pass Twin Lakes and move towards summits or other lakes but not many water options from the parking lot to Twin Lakes.",

Probably about 45 minutes total.",
