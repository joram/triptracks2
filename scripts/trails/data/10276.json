    "description": "An easy hike to some of the best views and wildflowers in BC.\nFrom the north car park, it is about 2 km to the peak.  After 300 m, the trail descends a bit into a bowl, then there is a steady uphill to the fire lookout at the peak.  The gradient is moderate, with a short steeper section where stairs are provided.  You should get to the top in about 45 minutes.\nAt the top, the views are amazing.  New Denver and Slocan Lake is below you, and mountain peaks are all around.  The main peaks are New Denver Glacier to the west, Kokanee Glarier to the SE, and Mt. cooper to the NE.  An interpretation sign names all the peaks.\nThere are lots of wildflowers in season, mainly June to September.",
    "directions": "From New Denver on Hwy #6, turn east on the road to Kaslo.  After about 8 km, turn south on the road to the old mining town of Sandon.  Near the end of the village, turn south briefly, then west on the gravel road marked \"Idaho Peak\".  Follow this road uphill for a good half hour, always following the signs to Idaho Peak.\nNear the end, at a switchback, you have the choice of the left or right side fork.  We took the right fork (actually straight ahead) 300 meters to the parking area.\nThe road is well maintained, and is suitable for any vehicle, except after a heavy rain.",
