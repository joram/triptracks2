    "description": "The Mt.Unnecessary Trail is a great workout. This is a steep hillside hike through 2nd growth conifers. It joins the ridge trail trail that comes in from Cypress Bowl. Views are ten times better than the Grouse Grind and there are few people too.This is a climb of roughly 3 km, roughly 1250m, and, as you can see from the topo map, steep.Bring plenty of water, and, be prepared.  Once up top, you may elect to continue to the Lions, however, that extends your hike by a few kilometers. You'll have fantastic views of Howe Sound.Access the trail from Lions Bay, by following Highway 99 from Vancouver to Lions Bay.  As the map points out, zig-zag yourself to the top of the small community, and park near the trail-head.  Accompanying GPS data shows the parking area near Waypoint #1 (set a GOTO and watch your progress as you approach Lion's Bay and wind your way up to the trailhead! 10U 483331e  5477943n Nad27Can).",
