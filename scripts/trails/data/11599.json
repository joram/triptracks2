    "description": "The first sanctioned new school flow trail, was rebuilt by the District of North Vancouver Trail crew in 2010. The proof is in the pudding of its popularity. On a nice day, you literally need to take a number for the flow show: big berms, small doubles and buff, undulating trail will have you climbing back up for another lap. Barely 10 minutes up Mountain Highway, it is easily accessed. It's importance lies not only in its popularity, but it proves new school trails can be built on the Shore.",
    "directions": "Accessed before the 2nd switchback, exits above the Baden Powell.",
