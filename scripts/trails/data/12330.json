    "description": "This is an area I wanted to explore after seing some sat imagery.  the imagery showed a large rock slide in a half moon shape.Striking off with my little explorers (7 and 10yo), we braved the rain and  mist and started off on the Bay of Fundy at the end of the hiltz Rd.  Luckily the rain stopped and within an hour the sun peaked in!   The whole hike is a natural play land for kids and adults!  There are huge blocks of rock that you can climb in and around and under.  there is a fairly large sea cave.  There are many minerals to look and gather...as well as perfectly white round .....golf balls! (there is a course above the cliffs).The walk skirts around some high cliffs so if the tide comes in you wont be able to retrace your steps so go for it at a time just before low tide so you have plenty of time to explore.  The large landslide turned out to be an old slide so it wasn't the best part of the hike.",
    "directions": "Highway 215 past Bramber.  turn on Hiltz Rd and continue to the end of it.",
