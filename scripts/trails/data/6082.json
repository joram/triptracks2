    "description": "A tour of the grassslands of Merritt. Using ATV roads and single track the loop can be as long or as short as you want. \r\rMake a weekend out of it by camping at Marquart or Lundbom lake.",
    "directions": "From Merritt take the exit to Hwy 5a heading towards Kelowna. At the top of the hill you will see a turn off to Lundbom lakes. Take this turnoff and drive down to the lakes and start your ride anywhere along this road. \r\rMakes for a nice XC ride.",
