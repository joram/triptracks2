    "description": "The Pinchot Trail is a 23 mile loop-type footpath in the Lackawanna State Forest. Backpack campers and hikers will find this trail on the Pocono Plateau challenging, exciting and beautiful. It offers everything from a scenic overlook of expansive forests, a path sheltered by hemlocks next to a gurgling creek, to bog areas which contain some plants not common to Pennsylvania.\r\rThe trail is blazed in orange. Although the entire trail can be hiked in one day by an experienced hiker in good physical condition, most hikers prefer to take two or more days. They either camp overnight along the trail or use one of the connector trails to make short one-day hikes. With a township road cutting through the center of the system, many one day hikers do the north loop and the south loop on seperate days.\r",
    "directions": "From Interstate 80 in Pennsylvania, take PA 115 north towards Wilkes-Barre. Pass the junction with PA 940 in Blakeslee (at a traffic light), and continue another 4.6 miles to SR 2040. Make a right onto SR 2040, which becomes SR 2013 at the county line. Take SR 2040 5.1 miles, and turn left onto Bear Lake road (SR 2016). Continue another 4.3 miles to a sign advertising the main trailhead for the Pinchot trail system. Turn right into the parking area. You will have passed the Lackawanna State Forest Headquarters on Bear Lake Road. (Lat:41.21874 Lon:-75.6315)",
