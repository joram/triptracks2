    "description": "A less traveled trail to the summit of the House Mtn Shield volcano near the village of Oak Creek Az.  The Turkey ck trail is 4.2 mile moderate trail through an area of scenic geology and vegetation.  The trail, known as #2392 in the Coconino National forest is not a commonly hiked route,  but it should be. Passing through ancient sandstones, mudstones in the local buttes and mesas the route take you to a scenic viewpoint overlooking the House Mtn shield volcano as well as Sedona to the north. The trail is non technical and requires moderate effort.  It climbs about 800' in elevation from trailhead to highest point but most of that climb is in the last mile or so.",
    "directions": "The trail is accessed from a well marked trailhead about 4.2 miles west along the Verde valley school road from hwy 179 in Oak Creek Az.",
