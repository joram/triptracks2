    "description": "Start at the Seymour Mountain ski parking lot. Follow the trail on the left hand-side of the ski run that starts at the end of the parking lot. The trail is basically uphill for most of the way to the peak. Follow the marked bamboo poles - when you get closer to the peak you will see a steep incline - this is usually fairly good to climb as steps are generally kicked to the top. After climbing this wall, you can either climb straight up the peak or traverse around to the right and then up the back side. On a clear day the view is awesome! For those with some back country experience, there are two additional peaks to attempt that can be seen behind this peak - if you tackle this allow another 2 hours to your time. When returning from the original peak there is a twisty and turny route that you can follow - traverse down the back of the peak and then head right down the valley following the bamboo poles.\r\n\r\nMake sure to take a warm jacket for the top as the wind can be chilly!",
