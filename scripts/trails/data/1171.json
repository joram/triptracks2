    "description": "The trail is an old fire access road, so it is wide and open.  The trail starts on the main trail to Willmore Wilderness Area and branches right at the Antler sign.  You can hear the falls from this location.  NTS Map: 083E14",
    "directions": "Drive North of Grande Cache to the Sulphur Gates Staging Area.  The trail leaves from the far end of the campsite.To get to the staging area, go W of GC on #40 just a couple km until you cross the bridge over the Smoky River.  Within a few hundred meters of the bridge, look for a turn to the left (south-south-west).  Drive down that road 7 km to the staging area.",
