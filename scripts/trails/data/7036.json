    "description": "A short and basic little ramble through the countryside up to the local high points. There is a survey monument (a very short monument - a 'Brass Cap') at the top and good vistas of the area. There is a Canadian Flag up there but painted on metal, very durable I would suspect.  A short spur leads you up to the summit of 180m (only about 40m higher than the parking area, so don't worry).\r\rThere are some very boggy sections along here, so bring your Wellies.\r\rIt was a misty, damp day when I was up there and the silence was very nice. You can poke around on some side trails and/or combine it with 2 other trails up here as well.",
    "directions": "From downtown Pouch (Pooch) Cove, take Meetinghouse Road SouthWest about 2 to 2.5km to either of the small parking pull outs and start up from there. Easy to find.",
