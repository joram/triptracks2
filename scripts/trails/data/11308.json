    "description": "This is a hike called Hell?s Point.  What is unique about his hike is that you will be on private land for most of it.  The landowners have agreed to have a trail set on their property as long as you use them at your own risk.Basically the trail goes around the Hells Point except for one property that you have to go around since there is a wooden fence.  From the beach, the trail quickly ascends in front of the homes and continues in a fallow field.  At the tip of the Hell?s Point there are a few small rocky cliffs and some kind of barrachois ponds.  On the opposite side, once you have gone around the fenced property, you continue in front of some spectacular home as you make your way towards Dry split Pond.  I saw lots of deers in the field so be on the lookout.  I would not drive all the way there to do this hike but if you do the Gaff Point hike nearby this is a quick addition to your day!",
