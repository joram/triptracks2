    "description": "This 15 km loop trail is well worth the strenuous workout up 915m to the Cory Pass, around behind Mt. Edith, past Mt. Louis and through the Edith Pass on the way back to the trailhead.  From the Fireside Picnic area follow the trail 1 km to the Cory pass junction.  You will then climb most of the 915 m over 4.5 km, eventually climbing well above the tree line.  There are several points to stop to catch your breath and take photos on the way up.   There is a tricky spot where the trail becomes indistinct on a sharp knoll on the ridge just before you come out of the trees.  Watch the trail markers carefully.Once through the Cory pass you will follow a rough trail for about 3.5 km through scree fields and across avalanche paths until you regain the main hiking trail at Edith Pass.  Descend along the drainage through the forest between Mt. Norquay and Mt. Edith until you loop past the Cory Pass junction again and then to the Trailhead.NTS Map: 082O04Elevation Gain: 920 m (3,018 ft).",
