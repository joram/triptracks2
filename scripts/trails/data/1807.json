    "description": "This is a great trail. Huge jumps from top to bottom. There are some large wallrides and some technical sections. This trail is not meant for unexperienced riders. Hardtails will be destroyed on this trail if any of the jumps are attempted. For the most part, the trail is smooth and fast-paced, but alot of the jumps landings are half-assed, with big jagged rocks sticking out of them. But i think that theres being work done to fix them",
    "directions": "Theres 2 ways to get there, you can either drive up panorama drive, then get onto the powerline trail and walk up the dentist and 4 lost souls, or you can drive up to the top of plateau blvd. to the locked gates and walk up to the top of lungbuster.",
