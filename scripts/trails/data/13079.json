    "description": "As you drive the Cabot Trail towards Plesant river and enter the Cape Breton highlands National Park, most people will pull off where you can see the skyline trail mountain.  The pull off area is just after the Corney Brook Trail.  In front of you is the tree less mountain and you can see the hikers at the end of the trail.For mre, I was always looking downwards...at the very deep ravine created by Jumping Brook.  I sought to see if there were some waterfalls in this ravine in late August 2018.  I used a small tributary as my guide down from the Cabot Trail to the brook below.  the descent is steep but always in a forest with loits to grab...the effort is mainly on the way back up.  the brook has a few smaller falls of 10-15ft at the downstream end where it plunges one last fall of about 20ft into the Gulf of St Lawrence",
