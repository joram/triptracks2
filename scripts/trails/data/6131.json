    "description": "First 30 minutes up a rock blasted access road.  Second half through wilderness with spectacular views to keep you motivated!  A few rocks to climb over and the final 360 degree view of Shawnigan Lake and the ocean definately worth it.  Good hiking shoes and trek poles are recommended.",
    "directions": "There are several ways to the top.  This particular hike is for the beginner.Take Shawnigan Lake/Mill Bay Road East, Turn left on Sylvester Road, right on Baldy Mountain Road, Left on Hawking Rd.  Stay on Hawking and it will curve to the right and change into Strathcona Heights.  You drive for aprox 3k and watch for gate to the left, up a bit from the road.",
