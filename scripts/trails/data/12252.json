    "description": "This is a hike to a mostly unknown fall just a few minutes from Halifax.   I had explored a brook in this area a few months ago on a hunch that a waterfall was around there but I never found anything.   It turned out that I had followed the wrong branch of the brook.This time around, the kids and I set off in a rain storm (March break activities with dad!), and followed a woods road to a small stream.  Then we saw some marks on trees leading downstream of the brook and within a minute...there it was a very nice and tall fall of about 20ft.  The area is surrounded by an evergreen forest.  the only drawback for this hike is that some people have dumped some garbage right at the trail's entrance (at least it makes the start easy to spot).",
    "directions": "Lucasville Rd.  turn on highway 101 service road and drive on it as you climb a small hill look for the garbage dump on your left and a pond on your right with a big beaver lodge.  Fall is at 44\u00b0 46' 43.47\" N  63\u00b0 43' 32.61\" W.",
