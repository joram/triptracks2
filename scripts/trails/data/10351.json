    "description": "The trails in the area appear to be under development and the trail head can be a bit hard to find as it is down the road a little bit from the trails sign. \nYou can take the Smallwood and Bigwood trails to create a loop. The trails are heavy forested. Smallwood has a few short steeper sections. Bigwood appears to be developed as a downhill for mountain bikes.Smallwood continues on along the ridge from that mapped. Another map on Trailspeak.com shows this option.",
    "directions": "From the Taghum bridge (Nelson side--8km from the city) drive west for 5.3km. Turn right onto Beasley Road. At 0.6km right onto Queen Victoria Rd (unpaved).
