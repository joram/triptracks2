    "description": "Mount Baldy is a short and steep hike that will take about 20 minutes to reach the top. From there you can go down the back side of the \"mountain\" and find Windward Falls. The falls are kinda neat and are about 6 feet high. Go in spring or else it will be dried up.\r\n\r",
    "directions": "\r\n\r\nDrive to the water tower in Chetwynd, and park at the gate.\r",
