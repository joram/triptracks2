    "description": "Vancouver's shoreline is a scenic place to paddle and kayak rentals are available at Ecomarine Kayak Rentals  at Jericho Beach, or, a variety of other places around town. During summer's Ecomarine also hosts Wednesday evening fun races - featuring half-price rentals.  \r\nIf you're using your own boat, park for free at Spanish Banks or Jericho Beach for a short walk to the beach, or use the pay parking at Jericho Beach Yacht Club, or by the Coast Guard dock near Burrard Street Bridge, on the south side of the water.  Watch for power boats and inner harbour ferries close to Granville Island.  Paddle into the inner harbour for a water view of downtown, Granville Island and Science World, or out along Kitsilano, Jericho and Spanish Banks beaches to the point of the University of British Columbia.  There are countless places to land for a picnic lunch.  Great view of the city and the mountains.\r\n\nMap of the Vancouver shoreline: NTS Map 092G06 \r",
