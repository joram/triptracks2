    "description": "This is a small (1.67km-return) unofficial trail to a very big waterfall on the upper reaches of the Musqodoboit river. I saw the name Phantom on a piece of board nailed on a tree by the fall.  This is a very massive waterfall and there are also some smaller ones downstream of the main one.  \n\nLooking on GoogleEarth there seems to be some other big white areas on the stream close by (looking upstream) and these could be other falls that I did not get the time to get to.  The unoffcial trail is flagged and starts into a logged area before entering a mature evergreen forest which in the summer would  shaded.  At the top of the fall there is lots of space for a tent and by the looks of it, it has been used by locals in the past as such.",
    "directions": "Make you way to Upper Musquodoboit.  From the corner of where highway 224 and 336 meet, continue 4.5km on highway 336 to a dirt road on your right.  Take dirt road for about 1.8km (drive over a bridge at mid point). Park and try to finf some flagging tape on your right which will lead to the falls..about 800m from the road.  Not sure if that road is plowed in winter.",
