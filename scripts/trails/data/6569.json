    "description": "This is the way to get to these 15 foot falls on the Fall river near New Glasgow.  The first part of the hiking I followed the brook but you could probably walk in the field that is located to the right of the brook to save you some time.  The walk through this forest to the falls is quite easy as there is not too much deadfall and the forest is pretty mature.  You do have the cross the stream a couple of times but it is not very wide so you can jump across easily.  The falls are located in a small cleft in the rocks and are very pretty.  Although the brook is not very big so I would be careful not to go in the dry season (if such a season exists in NS)",
    "directions": "Take highway 347 towards Sherbrooke (from Highway 104 pat New Glasgow).  In Mcphersons Mills, turn right onto Fraser Rd and take immediate left on Fall brook Rd.  Drive about 700m to culvert below the road.  Head upstream for about 1.3km to falls",
