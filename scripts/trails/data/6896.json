    "description": "This is a classic Okanagan hike.  The High rim trail and okanagan highlands trail pass this summit too.  The back access is a rock road that degrades rapidly.  The length of the hike depends on how far you can drive up the road. but soon you are above the forest and on rocky singletrack that goes behind the mountain before becoming a short ridge walk to the summit.  Various other routes exist, including a trail from the KVR.  Once at the top, crawford lake is visible and a good 1 hour detour.  not much trail distinction at the top, and exploring becomes choose your own adventure.  The lake was the highlight of the trip.  there was still some snow in july.",
    "directions": "this trail is difficult to find because the forestry roads are notoriously confusing.  Best access is off highway 33 by McCullough lake or up McCullough fsr from kelowna.  use the gps track from there.  The mountain is in a park, so no motorized vehicles.  Also accessible by the upper-crawford trail, which is off the KVR by the Bellview Trestle. Gps to follow.",
