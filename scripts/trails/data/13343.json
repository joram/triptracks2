    "description": "I don\u2019t remember what made me look at this particular stretch of South River but its probably satellite imagery.  South River already had two well known falls (via trailpeak post and my waterfall guide!) named Shingle Mill Falls and South river Mini Gorge and Falls.  The first is located in the headwaters of the river while the second is located downstream of the Factorydale dam.  This third fall on the system is located just a few kms upstream of the dam.  There are no trails that I know of to lead there and I just bushwacked my way for about 1km from a well travelled road to the falls.  The traverse of the forest was mostly uneventful and neither hard or easy.  Beals falls are just gorgeous.  There are two drops in quick succession followed by a deep pool and a 90 degree turn of the river.",
