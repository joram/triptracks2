    "description": "This is a sweet trail that goes up along Bear Creek.  It's not too difficult or long.  It's 3 km and gains and loses about 100m in elevation.  The trail follows along the top of the canyon and has some impressive views of the creek and Okanagan lake.  At the top of the trail, there is a small bridge and the return trip is done on the other side of the creek.  There are some stairs and steady but easy climbs.  Check it out.  There is a popular campground between the highway and the lake that requires a reservation for most hot summer nights.  The park is actually closed in the winter, but the trail is still accessable by parking on Westside Rd.",
    "directions": "Go south on Westside road off Highway 97, just outside Westbank.  If coming from Kelowna, cross the bridge and take a right (north) on Westside road.  The road soon is along the lake and the campground and parking is about 5 km north of the Westside rd./hwy 97 intersection.",
