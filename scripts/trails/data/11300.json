    "description": "This out and back trail is on land under an easement with the Nova Scotia Nature Trust. http://nsnt.ca/ourwork/explorer/?id=19.   It generally follows the Meander River upstream.  The trail is sparsely marked but quite well defined and easy to walk.  There are great views of the river which is beautiful to watch as it bubbles along over rocks and into pools.  At about the 1km mark the trail crosses the river.  It is not really passable during times of high flow. The trail beyond this point is marked by flagging tape but is less traveled, it continues along the river and eventually meets up to an old road that leads to a farm field.  The trail does continue along the river but is on marked private land please respect the signs.",
    "directions": "Trail head directly across the street from Smiley's Provincial Park by the bridge.  There is a small Nova Scotia Nature Trust sign.",
