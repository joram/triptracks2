    "description": "The Blind Bay to White Lake Connector was completed in the summer of 2009. This trail connects the Balmoral Bluffs Trail System to the White Lake Lookout Trail and the White Lake Bike Park. This trail features a wide variety of terrain, and forest types. The viewpoint above the White Lake and Tappen Valleys provides a breathtaking view of Salmon Arm to Notch Hill. If you are riding your bike, don't forget to stop in at the John Evdokimoff Bike Park to brush up on your technical skills. While not a technical trail, there is some signifigant elevation gain and loss. You can park a car at each trail head for an eight km trip, or go out and back for a 16 km trip.",
