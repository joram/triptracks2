    "description": "West Canyon Trail is actually the first leg of Golden Ears but this review will just be on the canyon trail.\nThe trail starts out easily enough with an easily graded gravel coated trail. Don't be lulled into a false sense of security soon after the trail transfers from gravel to a dry seem bed where it is all to easy to roll an ankle. The hike hen gets progressively steeper until the gold creek lookout. Watch your step around there. The trail continues on until the 4.5 kilometre point where you have to go down a 25 foot loose embankment and up the other side by the means of a thick yellow rope. there used to be a cable bridge there. Alder flats campground is about 500 metres down the trail",
    "directions": "From Vancouver take Hwy1 to the Port Mann bridge where you will take Hwy 7 to Maple Ridge and follow the signage to Golden Ears provincial park and then follow the main parkway to the sign telling you to turn in to the west canyon parking lot. You wills an interpertive bord an directional sign at the trail head.",
