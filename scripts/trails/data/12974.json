    "description": "This is an unassuming brook crossing near Mushaboom on the eastern shore.  i had spotted some white marks on the sat imagery and last year, I stopped and explored.  the walk from the car in a direct line to the fall is fairly easy and goes downhill.   As you approach the fall the forest get a bit thicker but its still easy to travel.  there is some kind of old foot bridge right over the 5ft fall.   I came out by following the old power line corridor back to highway 7.",
    "directions": "Highway 7 to where western brook crossed th highway near (N44\u00b0 51' 43.1\" W62\u00b0 34' 48.0\").  follow brook downstream about 500m to the fall at approximately N44\u00b0 51' 42.4\" W62\u00b0 34' 33.0\"",
