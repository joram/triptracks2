    "description": "An 11km ATV trail that leads to the summit of Sugar Mountain.  Just over 4,000' of elevation gained with very rewarding views and a shelter at the top.",
    "directions": "From Cherryville, turn north on Sugar Lake Rd.  Just after the Dam lookout on the left and when you can SEE the lake ahead of you, turn right onto the FSR road (Kate-Sitkum FSR).  This takes you up the east side of the lake.  After crossing the creek (at the end of the eastern bay of the lake), remain left against the water.  When you get to the rec site sign, stay right and continue up the hill.  After crossing Sugar Creek, just past the steep climb (where the road deteriorates slightly), there is a pullout on the left just past the trailhead on the right which has a \"notice to users\" sign.N50 25.139 W118 28.266",
