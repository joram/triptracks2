    "description": "This is a rare occurrence, a waterfall close to downtown and accessible by bus!  On MacIntosh Run there is a gorgeous little spot where the brook looses enough elevation to create a series of cascades.  A well worn path leads from the road all the way to the fall so no bushwacking required.  as for the name, I chose the name of a person who likes to explore falls and tagged me on this one that was missing from my map!",
    "directions": "Highway349 south towards Purcell Cove.  turn on Princeton ave and drive to its conclusion.  Walk by the metal gate and find the path just past that gate.",
