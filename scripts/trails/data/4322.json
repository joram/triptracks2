    "description": "This easy trail conveniently located in Beasley close to Nelson takes you to a paoramic view of the Nelson-Castlegar valley and surrounding mountains. The trail includes less steep options for biking (hikers take the steeper option). It includes a long ridge walk that offers hints of the view at the end. The elevation of the lookout is 4,200'. At the end of the ridge turn right to access the lookout (left takes you down another trail that will leave you an hour walk back to your vehicle).",
