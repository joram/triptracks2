    "description": "I wish the weather was nicer that day; we had rain, cloud, snow??yes, it?s snowing a little bit at the top, and a tiny bit of sun toward the end of our hike.  Just the normal Vancouver weather in April. The lake was still snow covered. \r\n\r\nThis is a moderate to strenuous hike; it takes about 3 hours to get to the lake (930 meter elevation gain), and the trail is quite steep at the beginning.  One hour in, you come to the old logging road with a gentle incline and then a steeper climb all the way to the lake.  You get views of Howe Sound and water falls. I can?t really say much about the lake, as it was still snow-covered.\r\nThere are 2 entrances to the trail, the first one is directly across from the parking area by the creek, and the second one is also on the opposite side of the parking area but is about 100 meters or so north of the parking area along Hwy 99. You will see the aluminium and orange tags and that?s where you start.\r\nIf you are using the attached gps waypoints, wpt001 or START is the entrance of the second trail.\r\nThe trail is well marked. There is a major fork at 1 km (I think) from the start; to the left takes you to Deeks Bluff, and the right to Deeks Lake.  From there, just follow the signs and orange tags all the way to the lake. On your hike down toward the bottom, when you come across an alternate route to Hwy 99 with a warning of steep rock ahead, don?t go there.  It?s almost impossible to hike down especially on a wet day.\r\n\r\n\r",
    "directions": "From Vancouver, take Hwy 99 toward Squamish, and as soon as you pass Lions Bay keep your eyes on the creek signs.  Deeks Creek is the one after Loggers Creek, and about 4 km from Lions Bay. The parking area is on the left side of the highway by the creek, but please don't try to make a left turn on the highway.  There is a turnaround area not too far ahead.\r",
