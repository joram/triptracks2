    "description": "14 km round trip trail to beautiful and quaint Grass lake, and then to the much bigger Shields lake. Trail starts off as an old gravel road of some kind and then branches off into 3 smaller trails after crossing the old sooke water pipe line. This trail is the middle trail which rises to 540 metres at the highest point. The trail gets progressively harder until you reach Grass lake where it opens up again into old 4x4 roads which will take you to Shields lake.",
    "directions": "Park on the right hand side of sooke river road directly before the gates to sooke potholes park. The trail starts off as a riverbed until you get to the galloping goose. Take the goose for about a km until you see a large trail on your right. This is the begining of the trail.",
