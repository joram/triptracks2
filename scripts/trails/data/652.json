    "description": "The trailhead is located on the Granite Lake Main Line, 1.5 km south of the Burma Road junction. Markers are Blue/Green on Red diamonds. A short distance along the trail you will come to a \"Y\".  The trail is a loop so you can go either way to return to this spot.  If you go straight (left) you will connect with a junction of the Suicide Creek Trail.  The trails actually merge for a short distance.  Follow the creek past the picnic area up to the upper bridge.  Turn right and follow the trail to return to the junction you started from. Turn left at the junction and follow the trail back to the Granite Main Line. Some of the highlights of this trail include Suicide Creek and an excellent creek side picnic site.",
    "directions": "Access to the trail is from Highway 101 south of Powell River via the Goat Lake Main Line (name changes to Granite Main Line part way up). Trailhead is approximately 1.5 km off of Highway 101, south of the Burma Road junction. If you pass Burma Road, you've gone too far.  Park off the road and enjoy your hike.",
