    "description": "Right next door to my latest adventure was another valley I was curious to explore.  I had enough time that day and decided to check it out.\n\nFrom the secondary logging road, I aimed my GPS and followed a faint stream through a logged area.  After not very long, the logging area ended and the canopy soared overhead.  The stream kept loosing elevation but it was just small cascades until finally I could see ahead where the brook was plunging from a great height into the unknown.  After carefully going around a little cliffy part, I was able to bask at the foot of a 45 ft true drop. Wow!  One really scenic fall\u2026but then I wondered\u2026was there another one downstream?   I followed my hunch and sure enough where the brook empties into another, there is another 30ft slider type cascade fall.\n\nFrom here I followed the other branch of the brook and found more cascades and one other fall on the side wall of about 20ft.  This brook is small and if you don\u2019t plan ahead it might be dry so plan accordingly.",
