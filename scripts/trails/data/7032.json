    "description": "A short and basic little ramble through the countryside up to the local high points.  There is a survey monument (a very short monument - a 'Brass Cap') at the top and good vistas of the area.\r\rIt was a misty, damp day when I was up there and the silence was very nice.  You can poke around on some side trails and/or combine it with 2 other trails up here as well.",
    "directions": "From downtown Pouch (Pooch) Cove, take Meetinghouse Road SouthWest about 2 to 2.5km to either of the small parking pull outs and start up from there.  Easy to find.",
