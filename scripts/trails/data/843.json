    "description": "Strike up the embankment into the forest and look for more ribbons. The rough trail climbs steeply and has several slippery sections supported by hand lines. Work on the trail currently ceases above where it traverses, notably south at about 840 m.\r\nIt is best to time your hike when spring snow covers the forest floor down to 800 m or so. Snow trudge over the marshy outlet of Vicar Lake and on to the summit. There are some big yellow cedars just above the lake. We measured one with a circumference of 6.1 meters. A worthwhile destination for a day out on Vancouver's North Shore for those who have run out of new things to do there.\r\n\r\nThe information above and the GPS route are from a hike in June of 2001. There has been some trail work done since.",
    "directions": "Mt. Bishop can be climbed in a day from Seymour Spur 4. Mountain bike to within 200 m of the watershed gate. Three parallel red ribbons wrapped around a smaller sized tree on the downhill/Seymour River side of the road, just north of a small creek, mark the beginning of the trail.\r",
