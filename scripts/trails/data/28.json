    "description": "NTS Map: 092G07\r\nWe have included the racer maps for the Whistler race (since we did them), where those considering the race can check out a previous year's route. \r\n\r\nInterestingly, I did this route with friends way back when in 1998 I believe, where one groups started by bike from Squamish, the other by kayak from Deep Cove, we camped and switched the next day.\r\n\r\nIf you do so, ensure you plan your trip accordingly, this is wild country, and you may encounter snow at the upper reaches. There is also some steep and dangerous downhill past the height of land, getting close to Squamish. Consider hiring a guide or going with an experienced group, or, just train like mad and sign up for the race, your best bet. Check out  www.sea2summit.com",
