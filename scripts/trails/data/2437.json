    "description": "Section of the Baden Powell trail from Lynn Valley Road to Grouse Mountain Skyride.\r\n\r\nNice mix of terrain and a couple of okay views of Downtown. The route intersects several mountain bike trails, so it could be a good way to scope out potential rides.\r\n\r",
    "directions": "Take the 228 bus from Lonsdale and get off at the terminus at the top of Lynn Valley road. Follow the road into the park, looking for the trail entry on the left. Zoom in on the Google Map preview for details.\r\n\r\nAt the other end you can get the bus back to Lonsdale from Grouse.",
