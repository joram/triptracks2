    "description": "The FM Radio trail was constructed and maintained by the Sooke Mountain Biking Club. They have done a sterling job with its construction with berms, rock trails and culverts.\r\rThis trail works well for making a loop trail to go up and over the mountain. The other trail on this website is better to ascend on. Once you get to the fire tower at the top, you can follow this trail down the back of the mountain and onto Sooke Mountain Road for your trip back the car or the other way to Shields and Crabapple Lakes.",
    "directions": "Drive along Sooke Road from Victoria and turn right onto Harbourview Road just after the Shell gas station. Drive to the very end where there is a CRD Parks parking lot. Hike past the main gate and hike up the wide, gravel road for 3.5 kilometers. You should see a \"no motor vehicles\" sign on the right side to indicate the trail leaving the main gravel road. The rest is pretty easy. Watch out for bikes coming down the trail on a nice day!",
