    "description": "The trail to Rummel Lake is pleasant walk mostly through the forest to a small lake at the end. \r\rThere is only one view point at 1.6 from the start where you can see Spray lakes reservoir to the west, other that it's a walk in the forest until you arrive at the lake.\r\rThe trail is a bit \"rooty\" you have to watch your step continually.\r\rThere are fish in the lake so you can take your fishing gear along and spend a pleasant day at the lake.\r\rYou can walk all the way around the lake. \r\rIt's also possible to continue over the pass to Galatea Lakes",
    "directions": "As per Rummel Lake winter. Opposite the Mt Shark road, trail begins on the east side of Smith Dorien. There is a pull out right at the start of the Mt Shark road where you can park.\r\rOne difference from the winter trail, ignore the bridge on the left when you arrive at it about 1km before the lake. The trail continues and for a short time deteriorates along the edge of the creek. The good trail continues about 30 meters further on.",
