    "description": "We had intended to do the Volcano Ridge Loop but the road was closed on Gorge Creek Trail before Volcano Ridge parking lot so we started out from Gorge Creek trailhead. The trail started out with promise with a small ascend through the forest and dropping down into meadows loaded with flowers. The next 4+ km, along the Gorge Link Trail, was quite flat and uneventful so when we reached the juction with Link Creek Trail, that goes to Volcano Ridge Trail, we said \"boring\" and headed to Volcano P.L. and back to our truck via the road. This trail is mostly used by equestrians so m.bikers beware it's chewed up in spots. The trail was not our cup of tea, we've heard the rest of the loop offers quite a bit of variety,  maybe you would like it. Both trailheads have maps that are readable and in good shape.\r\nEditor's Note: The enclosed GPS data and pictures are from the 27km long full loop.  It was a long ride, it felt much longer than 27km somehow.  Mighta had something to do with the over 700m of elevation gain.\r",
    "directions": "From Turner Valley take Hiway 546, Sheep River Trail, ~30 km to Gorge Creek Trail. Follow gravel road ~8 km to trailhead. Road closure, from Sandy McNabb's on 546 right thru  Gorge Creek Trail to the 459, in effect from Dec. 01 to May 14.",
