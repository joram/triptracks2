    "description": "NTS Map: 082G10- July 2nd, 2006. There are a number of bolted routes for rock climbing accross from Crowsnest Lake. Routes can be for sport or lead climbing and range from 5.4 to 5.10d. We only had time to try a couple of routes before is started to rain (we tried 'Unfinished Business' and 'Amazing Grace'. If you can find Chris Goble's Rock Climber's guide to southern alberta  he describes 11 routes on Knob Hill as well as many others in the Pass).",
    "directions": "Take highway 3 and park at Crowsnest Lake. Cross the highway and seek out a path going to the cliffs at the base of Mt. Sentry(see map and 1 waypoint).",
