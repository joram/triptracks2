    "description": "Most people climb straight up the 30 to 45 degree front side front the old gravel pit.  We went up the old road (now atv trail) to the back side and then bushwacked our way to the peak.  Its much longer but about 9kms, but it's much less scrambling up loose gravel and through standing dead birch trees. We descended down the front side, so this portion of the track could be used to find a way up.",
    "directions": "Drive to Pleasant bay and head North to Ref River, look for Hinckley Glen Road on the right, follow that up to the old gravel Pit.  The ATV trail is a little back from the pit by the wooden bridge.  If you decide to go straight up, the pit is as good as anywhere to head in.",
