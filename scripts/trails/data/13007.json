    "description": "This is a beautifully wooded trail that travels over an escarpment in Grand Beach Provincial Park. The route is a compilation of trails, some dual track (main trail) and others single. This route was designed so that you can discover, at another time, the many single-track trails that run off of the main trails. Note the waypoint on the map that indicates the direction to begin in. The section between junctions 8 and 9 will be ridden twice. The 1st time turn left at junction (jcn) 8 and right at jcn 9. When you arrive at the jcn 8 the 2nd time, turn right and then left at jcn 9. Although much of this trail is at the beginner level there are several rocky and fairly steep hills that require an intermediate skill level and a good fitness level. There are paper maps available near the parking lot.",
    "directions": "Enter the East Beach gate at Grand Beach Provincial Park off of Hwy 12. Once through the gate it is a short drive to the right turn for the ski/hiking trails.",
