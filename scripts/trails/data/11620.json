    "description": "Just off the old Cobequid highway is a man made tunnel which is about the size of a ten year old.  The tunnel was made so a small stream could pass underneath the railroad track above.  The forest on both side of the tracks are a mixture of evergreen and deciduous trees.  The easiest approach is to follow the track from highway 4.  Notice the rock walls on either side.   You should hear a brook on your left and also it's the only place you can easily enter the woods as before that point the sheer walls will prevent any entry.Inside the tunnel there is one spot where they have enlarged the tunnel and you can stand upright and its also the widest.  Water is never deep except one or two spots where it might be 30cm deep but you can jump over those.",
    "directions": "Highway 4 from Debert.  Park on the bridge that goes over railroad track and walk on the track due east for about 250m.",
