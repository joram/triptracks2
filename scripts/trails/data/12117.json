    "description": "This is a hike to an unknown waterfall on a tributary of the rights River, North of Antigonish.  The brook starts unassuming by the road and as you fight your way through some dense brush at first ...you are not having fun.  However, the forest soon starts to be more mature and the walking becomes easier.  I was getting nervous that there were no falls on this brook and was just about to turn back when I spotted a very nice 20ft plus fall almost at the top of Connors Mountain.  Sometimes it pays off to be pig headed!!!  Upstream is a narrow area where two smaller falls occur just upstream.  afterward I crossed the plateau that is pretty much an open forest so no real bushwalking involved.  I reached a brook about 600m in distance figuring that there might be more falls on that one..... Well donate bother...there is nothing on that brook.  So if you follow my gps track only go up and down the more northern brook!",
    "directions": "Highway 245 north of antagonism, Turn on Clydesdale Rd and then on Pleasant Valley Rd.  Turn left on Connors Mtn rd and park where the brook meets the road at 45.693504, -62.099710",
