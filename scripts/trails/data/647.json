    "description": "NTS Map:92C9.  A 2.8 km loop trail from the parking lot leads to Botanical Beach and Botany Bay. It leads to the shoreline with many tide pools and abundant opportunities to observe marine life. Some parts of the trail are elevated wood paths and stairs. The east end of Botanical Beach connects with Juan de Fuca Marine Trail. It is best visited at minus tides.  Caution should be exercised when near the ocean as rogue waves can be large and dangerous. Warnings were posted 16 May 2003 regarding bears approaching camp sites. There is GPS data attached to this trail (see \"download GPS\"), which if loaded into your GPS can help you find route points.",
    "directions": "Stay on Highway 14 from Victoria until it ends at Port Renfrew. \r\nIn town, take a left uphill just when you enter the harbor area.
