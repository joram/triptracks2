    "description": "Manic  5 Dam, Flagship of Hydro Quebec power ; the reservoir: a 70 km wide donut, created by a meteoritic impact.  Now full of water retained by the dam.  A wonderful  place for sea kayaking: \r- With the Mont-Groulx in the back ground and its 1000m summits;\r- The central uplift (the hole of the donut)  also with 1000 m summits  and sharp edges;\r- A shore line looking like shaped by tides;\r\rTwo couples, Martine&Michel and Sylvie&Myself(Bruno); We have a three days week end. We planned a 7o km  itinerary on the revervoir extendable to 90 km.  Entering the reservoir at the boat ramp on the Thimines River and getting out at Le Camp du Prospecteur, 70 km South.  We have the option to continue up Le Relais Gabriel adding another 20 km, if we have time on Monday.\r\rThanks to our friend Ghislain for the first night and Bernard for the second night with their cabins on the reservoir.  That makes camping much comfortable.\r\rThe sceneray was so nice on Sunday afternoon, that we decided to camp there.  Too bad for the additionnal 20 km. The exit point will be Le Camp du Prospecteur.\r\rFor 2012, we planned a family weekend with the Zodiac on the reservoir. Plenty of space and scenery to discover. \r\rThe pictures speak by themselves.\r\r",
    "directions": "From Baie Comeau, take the 389 North up to Km 210. From there (betwenn km210 and km390) following the 389 , there is 5 or 6 entry points on the reservoir.\r",
