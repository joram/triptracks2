    "description": "The Forks Grind ascends up the side of the Credit Valley up and over the bluffs surrounding the Forks of the Credits. In .6km you gain approximately 500feet of \relevation with much of the hike in the 15-22% grade range. \r\rSome ascents require climbing over small rocks approximately 3-4 feet tall mid \rtrail - much of the climb is stairs - and the ending has a well built rock stair \rascent with a guide rope on the side for additional balance.\r\rVery nice views - feels like British Columbia in Ontario - great workout as well. \r\rIn the winter it can be very icy but is doable with proper hiking gear - however \rdescending without proper poles can be dangerous as much of the area is quite \ricy and steep.",
    "directions": "Proceed down Forks of the Credits Road west from Highway #10. Parking is \ropposite Chrisholm St. on the road. Once parked walk south on Chrisholm St \rand the trail head begins at the end of that short street. \r\rEnjoy!",
