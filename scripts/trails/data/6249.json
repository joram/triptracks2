    "description": "A fairly demanding ride, all up (500m+ in 8.7km), then all down, followed by 6km of hiway back to the parking lot.  To be fair, there are some nice views along the way, especially when you get to Baldy Pass.  Good training route, good workout, not flowey.\nFrom the parking lot, you ride through the UofC grounds, past the little lighthousey thing, and up the Bill Hoar Crescent or something where a couple mobile homes are.  The singletrack up starts from the end there.  There is an alternate path up using the double track road that starts about 800m North up the highway and adds 1km onto the loop.\nOn the way down, you lose 300m in the first 2km down from the pass (15% grade) and it is a technical, rocky, rooty 4.5km descent.  2 words of advice: All Mountain.\nPast the 2km of rocks and roots the trail opens up a bit and runs along a very gravelly stream where it is easy to lose sight of the trail, but no problem, just keep going down and it spits you out on the hiway where you turn right and start riding back to the cars.\nThis is near:",
