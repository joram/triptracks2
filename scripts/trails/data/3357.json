    "description": "Lots of steps, all well built.  the trail follows a staircase up the gorge to a set of tall but low volume falls.  an easy hike in this small park.  Watch out for bears.  On the way down, use the stairs or take a trail by the rusty remains of on old irrigation pipe.  Hard to miss, really.",
    "directions": "Enter the Fintry Provincial Park off Westside road.  The road follows the west coast of Lake Okanagan.  Park by the old buildings, just inside the park gate.  The trail leads past the building and to the right.  It is very hard to miss.",
