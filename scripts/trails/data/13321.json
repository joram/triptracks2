    "description": "Trail initially ascends up creek on Cranbrook Hill off of Foothills Blvd, heads north and then loops back down. Its well marked, but is more of a track than a trail. Can be travelled from South to North or vice versa. Access points on either end are the City of Prince George storm water collection points. You will see tracks of many animals - deer, moose, lynx, bear and of course, little critters like rabbits. You will also see remnants of old mountain biking escapades.Directions:South trailhead is the access right to the right of Blue Rock off of Foothills Blvd, across from Freimueller Park. Follow the creek up the hill, and eventually there will be a gully to the right which you'll follow north. The North trailhead is south of Rolling Mix Concrete. There is no access road, just a pullout off the side of the road from which you can see a gully where creek comes down. Head up to the right, trail ascends along right side of creek.",
