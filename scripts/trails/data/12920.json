    "description": "Cutbank Falls is a 2.5 km hike into a remote area seldom visited in the winter making it a nice quite hike on snowshoes. You follow quad trails that I'm sure would be a mud bog in the summer. There is a decent of about 100 m down to the falls that is a easy ascent on the return trip.",
    "directions": "Travel South of Grande Prairie on Hwy 40. After crossing the Cutbank River, continue south on the Hwy to the top of the hill (about 1 km) turn left onto Teddy Lane and park. Walk across the hwy to the west bush line and go about 50m south to find the trail head leading west.",
