    "description": "This is a longish loop hike along the ridge of Chuckanut Mountain with views of the valley below and the town of Bellingham Washington.  As most of the time is spent hiking up and down an undulating trail, the views from the ridge are not spectacular compared to those later on the return part of the loop.",
    "directions": "Highway 11 skirting Bellingham, and up Samish road to trail-head with sign \"Arroyo Park\".",
