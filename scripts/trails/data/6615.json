    "directions": "Travel on Sooke Road towards Sooke. At Harbour view road, just before Sooke, turn East. At the end of Harbour view road is the parking lot and the gravel road that leads up to the lookout. The first right off the gravel road is easy to miss but is at UTM 10 U 450112 5362264. The lookout is at the peak, at UTM 10 U 451168 5363194.\rNice views at the top.",
