    "description": "Trails within Boyle Point Provincial Park and Morrison Marsh Nature Reserve can be combined to make a very scenic loop. The terrain includes meadows, mature forests, marshes and views of the Strait of Georgia, Baynes Sound and Vancouver Island. Starting at the end of Green Hill Road means that Eagle Rock and Chrome Island viewpoints can make pleasant mid-hike rest places. In spring of 2019 there was an active eagle's nest that can be viewed from above by walking a few meters west of the Chrome Island viewpoint.",
    "directions": "Take BC Ferries from Buckley Bay to Denman Island. At the top of the hill turn right on Denman Road then soon another right on Lacon Road. About 5 kilometers along Lacon, turn left on McFarlane Road, then right on Green Hill Road. The trail head is at the end of Green Hill Road.",
