    "description": "The trail from Paradise Inn to Camp Muir is difficult, steep at times, and crosses snowfields on the Paradise Glacier. Do not underestimate the difficulty of this climb and bring appropriate cold weather and rain gear to protect from hypothermia even on clear days. The climb up to Panorma Point is particularly steep and, depending upon snow conditions, crampons and ice axe may be required for this section.  At camp Muir there is a public bunk house that is built into a rock band at approximately 10,200 feet. There are public toilets and sleeping accommodations to weather out any storm here. Camp Muir is located just under Gibraltar rock between the Nisqually glacier and the Cowlitz glacier.",
    "directions": "Follow 706 East through Ashford, Washington to Mt. Rainier National Park. There is a Ranger station where entrance to the park is gained for a $30 fee for climbers, $20 for hikers. From there the road continues up through the park to Paradise. At paradise, there is an inn, food, and lodging, and one can gain access to the Camp Muir Trail.",
