    "description": "This is a trail that is mostly used by mountain bikers in search of very nice single tracks in gypsum and karst terrain.  The last time I was riding, I took a pause from riding and followed a karst depression.  At the end of the depression lies an exposed gypsum face.  At the base of the gypsum is the entrance to the cave.\nFrom the mountain bike trail it's only a few hundred metres to the cave entrance.  Basically the trail follows the contour of a ravine.  At the bottom of the ravine you will find the gypsum exposure and the karst cave.  The descent is moderate and trees are evenly sparsed for a easy descent into the ravine.  At the bottom of the ravine, there is an intermittent stream that is actively eroding the cave passage.",
