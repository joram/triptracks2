    "description": "Easy trail which follows the Pacific Northwest Trail in parts leading up to Alger Alp, a bit of a hill just northeast of the town of Alger.  From there you can head down to Squires Lake encircling it before retracing your steps back to Alger.  Nice views of the Olympic Range on a nice day.",
    "directions": "Take Exit 240 off the I-5 and head east a kilometre or so.  Once you reach the main intersection in town, in another couple hundred metres you will see a gated road on the left.  Park just beyond that on either side of the road just before Silver Creek.  Walk back to the gated road and head up the trail.",
