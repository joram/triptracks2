    "description": "I had some doubts that there might be some falls on this tributary.  The main West Bass River has a large one at approximately the same contour lies I decided to visit on a crisp March morning.the first stream I followed lost a lot of elevation but never achieved any large fall.  Once another tributary  met up with the one I was following there was a couple of nice 10-15 ft falls.  I decided to follow that second tributary upstream.  although it didn't show on my 1:50 000 topo it showed up on a 1:10000.   After a few nice small fall, I was rewarded with a huge fall.  I would say its a good 50ft plus.  However it might only flow strongly in spring or after rain events.",
