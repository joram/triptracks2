    "description": "This is a trail that will take you to the Brigus Lightstation.  Its a beautiful trail with a lot of ups and downs.  In the late summer you can pick berries all along the way.  the view along the trail over looking Brigus is quite beautiful.",
    "directions": "The trail starts in the town of Brigus.  Drive to the area leading to the Historic Kent Cottage (LandFall).  There are two ways in which you can start.  In the parking area, you can see a trail facing north, you can proceed along this trail, or take the trail leading into Kent Cottage (LandFall).  Just before the gates into the cottage follow a rockwall North up the hill and follow along the trail.  Don't be surprised if you see a cow along the way.",
