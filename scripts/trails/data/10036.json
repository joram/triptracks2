    "description": "The longest of the west bragg ski trails, Telephone Trail is a fun combination of old exploration roads and single track. The trail winds through mixed wood foothills forest as it follows the route of a telephone line that once connected the elbow and jumpingpound ranger stations.",
    "directions": "In Bragg creek, cross the bridge over the elbow river and drive 10km west to west bragg picnic area. A map and sign on the north end of the parking lot mark the trail head.",
