    "description": "The network of trails on Burke is large and complex.  Some date back to the logging days in the early 1900's, when it was known as Dollar Mountain.  Most of the mountain biking trails are located on the lower half of the mountain, with endpoints on the Coquitlam River, Harper Road and Victoria Drive (AKA Quarry Road).  The broad plateau on top of the mountain has excellent hiking and snowshoeing, with access to Widgeon and Coquitlam Peaks.",
