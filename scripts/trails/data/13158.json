    "description": "This trail is an out and back up to falls. There is usually water over the falls in the wet months. This is an easy steady climb up that starts on an outwash plain then as you turn the corner it continues up a major wash. The trail narrows for the last 500m into a slot canyon and ends at the falls. Though the trail is easy going the ground underfoot is rocky and sandy so good footwear is recommended.",
    "directions": "Travel to Furnace Creek in Death Valley. There is an unmarked gravel access road located 31.5 miles south off of Badwater Road.  Take CA-190 to the start of Badwater road and travel south between mile markers 31 & 32.",
