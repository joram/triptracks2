    "description": "This is a fall that lies in the middle of nowhere north of Chester, NS.  You can drive a way on a logging road if you vehicle has clearance for it.  If not start walking on the logging road and continue until it ends.  then enter the woods and make a bline for the stream.  I found this fall to be about 18ft or so and it's a rare sight for this area.",
    "directions": "Highway 14.  turn on Cannan rd and drive on it until you cannot anymore.  the fall is approx at N44.70296 W64.24113",
