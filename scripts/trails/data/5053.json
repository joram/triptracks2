    "description": "This trail leads from the highway down a marshy trail and end up at the crash site of an old Canso A plane that went down in 1945.  We parked at the bottom of the Radar Hill entrance by the parking ticket dispenser. It's a bit of a walk up the highway to telephone pole marker 300. The track shows where to turn off the highway. The trail goes up over a ridge and then drops down into a wet marshy area. There was loads of mud and puddles here and made progress a little slow.  After a while in the mud the trail starts to go up the ridge on the other side of the marsh. The plane is tucked in the trees on the side of the ridge. Just before the crash site the trail goes past a circular hole usually filled with water. This is where the bombs from the wreck were detonated by clean up crews soon after the plane crashed.",
    "directions": "Drive towards Tofino. The Radar Hill parking lot is a few km before you get to Tofino. The trail head is on the highway about a kilometre south of the Radar Hill parking lot.",
