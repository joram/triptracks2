    "description": "The trail is an estimated 22 miles long in the South section. It?s a wide gravel path in the summer and groomed snow in the winter.  There are two sections because the entire trail is not yet complete and there are around 30 miles between the North and South parts.  The South section intercepts the Friendship Trail which runs along I-10.\nIn the winter season, snowmobiles are allowed on some parts of the trail depending on conditions.  Horses are allowed during the summer months.",
    "directions": "On the norther edge of Lake Butte de Mortes, taking 41 (North) over the lake, take the first exit after the bridge, take a right, and then another right. You'll go under the bridge. The parking lot for the northern portion of the trail is 1/4 mile down on the right hand side.",
