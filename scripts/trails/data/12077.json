    "description": "A less than lazy paddle down the Bow River from the Ghost Lake Dam. The beauty of the sunny fall day and the foothills was in contrast to the river itself. We were paddling a tandem kayak during a moderately fast flowing day. Just purchased the kayak and totally unprepared for the river.Recommend not using a 2-seater kayak as they are not as maneuverable in a strong current!!",
    "directions": "Hwy 1A 17Km west of Cochrane, AB. Left at Cottage Club - Ghost Lake, follow dirt road down to electrical dam and carry \"watercraft\" down path to river approx. 300m.Note: no parking on the dam or the access road.",
