    "description": "An easy and flat trail that leads away from Okanagan lake.  It follows and crosses a small (and slightly unnaturally modified) creek.  The end is a 3 meter waterfall with a pool to splash around in during the summer.  This trail is very popular due to its easy access, short length and easy walking.",
    "directions": "Just south of Peachland, take Hardy road away from the lake.  The parking area is only about 100m off highway 97.  The trail head is well marked. Park next to a trailer park.  The beach at the intersection of hardy road and Highway 97 is a good spot for a swim after.",
