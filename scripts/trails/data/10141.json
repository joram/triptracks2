    "description": "The trail is the former location of an abandoned railway line and is flat, wide, and gravel covered.  Some of the trail runs through farm land while other parts run along the dyke structures along the Salmon River / Bay of Fundy. There are benches along the river trail - great for bird watching! \nYou'll see many use the trail to run, and dog walk. Come winter, some use it to cross country ski. At one of the parking lots, there is a natural spring where many come to bottle the fresh clean water.\nThere are great views across the water, and if you time it right, you'll see the tidal bore rush in.\nThe trail is linear and extends out past the community of Old Barns.",
    "directions": "Take exit 13 in Truro, turn right and drive to Willow Street (about 1.5km).  Turn left at the lights, \nand go past the hospital (about 1km). Turn left and park by the A&W. \nYou can also start in the middle of the trail out on highway 236.  It is off of exit 14 about 0.5km. It is \nacross the street from a convenient store.  There is signage and a designated parking area. \nThe Province has a trails page detailing the route:\nhttp://www.trails.gov.ns.ca/SharedUse/co015b.html",
