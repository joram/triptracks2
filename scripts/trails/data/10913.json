    "description": "OMG, not often will I use this acronym but Carter's beach could be located somewhere down south....except that you would have to overlook the gnarly black spruce on the shore  The sand is powdery white and super fine.  Water looks inviting but not enough to go in in February.  A 10ft outlet of a pond prevented us to walk the whole beach but looks like it continued a long way.  Some sand dunes can be spotted being overtaken by vegetation.",
    "directions": "Drive the 103 towrads Liverpool.  South of liverpool, you will come up to Port Mouton.  Turn left on Central Port Mouton Rd and then left again on Carters Beach Rd",
