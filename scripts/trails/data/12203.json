    "description": "This was an area I was curious about for a while.  You see the name on highway signs, parks are names after it; Mt Uniacke!So I decided to see what the mountain was all about.  I decided to get to it from highway 101 as I was traveling back from other explorations in the valley.  The first 2.5km or so is very boring as it is on an old railroad track.  Once you see the Five Island Lake, it's time to head off into the woods on a north direction.I was there in the winter and got into some fairly deep snow.  The small evergreen created air pockets and I would sink way down at each step.  The mountain climb is only a whopping 60m elevation gain or so but the soft snow made it hell.  all in all, you get to the top and in winter you can see some views to the south but not much more.   I did intercept some snowshoe tracks close to the summit but they were heading towards the provincial park.",
