    "description": "This is a very short hike that takes you to an old mining adit on the shore of \rthe Walton River in Walton, Nova Scotia.\r\rCross the old cemetery by the side of the road and then onto the salt march.  \rThere is a small but deep brook to cross in the salt march towards the relatively \rhigh hill that stands between you and the Walton river.  There are a few mining \radios that have been infilled on the eastern side of the hill.  However if you go \raround the hill to the side facing west and the Walton river, you come across a \rsmall adit that was used for mining.  It's about 30ft deep and 5ft high.  Just \ramazing to think that people used to spend days crouch in those to access \rminerals.  In front of the admit and towards the river, you will see a perfect \rcircle of water (you can actually see this from google earth as well).  This is \rprobably an old bend of the river that was cut off from the main channel some \rtime ago.",
    "directions": "Highway 215 to Walton.  In Walton, turn on road going south(walton back \rRd??).  this is the road that parallels the east side of the river.  Park by the \rchurch and cemetery on the right",
