    "description": "This loop trail begins at the easily accessible Mt. Seymour ski parking lot.  The trail first heads to the relatively easy Dog Mountain, then along a more difficult trail called Suicide Bluffs, finishes on better marked BC Provincial trails that go to Brockton Point, then back to the parking lot.  Without any cloud cover, spectacular views of Vancouver, and the range of mountains heading north beginning at the other local ski hill, Cypress Mountain.",
    "directions": "From the city of Vancouver, take the Second Narrows Bridge north to exit 22 for Mount Seymour Parkway and head east until you reach the left hand turn for Mount Seymour Road.  Drive up this road until you reach the Mount Seymour ski parking lot at the very end of the road.",
