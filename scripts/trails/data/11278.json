    "description": "This is a hike to a hidden waterfall in the spout moutons near Berwick.  I followed a hunch to follow this stream as it entered a ravine between two hills.  I followed it for about 25min and was just about to turn back because the topography was becoming very flat.  surprise; at the next bend a beautiful 25ft with a kind of hot tub pool at it's bottom.  The area near the fall is used by locals as there are signs of fire pits.  The forest the whole way is mostly softwoods with some pretty good size pine trees in there. I found that following the right hand side of the stream (looking downstream) was easiest as there were less fallen trees to duck under.   It also look like some logging has occurred on the opposite bank therefore there are lots of raspberry plants to plow through",
    "directions": "Take Cambridge Mountain Rd from highway 1 near Waterville.  turn right on  Prospect Rd and park at the bottom of a steep gully where Sharpe Brook flows.  Follow it downstream for about 1km to the fall.",
