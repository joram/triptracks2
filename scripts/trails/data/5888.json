    "description": "Klondike Bluffs is an in-and-out to a fantastic viewpoint over Arches National Park.  It has a variety of terrain and is a fairly easy trip, among the flatter and easiest in the area.   243meters of climbing on the way in, and all downhill on the way out.\nI think this is where there are a couple sand traps, nothing serious but you'll probably walk 100 meters or so.\nIt also gives access to Baby Steps (which aren't for babies) and climbs up to a series of bluffs.  Do this in the evening to really see the colors come alive.  We nearly overstayed our welcome there as darkness falls fast. If you want to ease into Moab, you want a short after supper ride or any other reasons you want to take it easy, this is a great choice.",
    "directions": "Drive about 22.4 km North of Lions Park (Highway 128 corner) at the North end of Moab. Turn right (East) and drive just under 1km to a well marked trailhead.  You can stop earlier and ride the road to make a longer trip.\nAccommodations:\nA lot of people hiking and biking in the MOAB area stay at condos managed by www.moabutahlodging.com, speak with Andrea. They offer a range of in town homes and condos.",
