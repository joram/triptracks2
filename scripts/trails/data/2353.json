    "description": "You will climb until 380 meters and it is a difficult hiking trail. You require some basic equipments as good boots and enough water. The walking time to complete the circuit Wolf Trail is five hours approximately. Tawadina Lookout is 335 meters high and Mahingan Lookouts are about 380 meters high. From both lookouts, Tawadina and Mahingan, you can see the Ottawa River and the Ottawa Valley. From there you have a very beautiful and an interesting view. Wolf Trail has become the favorite trail of the Gatineau Park",
