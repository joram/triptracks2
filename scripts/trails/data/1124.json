    "description": "Good all around typical MTB trail.  Its got hills, dales.  You'll laugh, you'll cry (well, you probably won't cry unless you're a girl (unless you're one of those girls that can kick my ass (which there is no shortage of))).  150m from lowest to highest elevation.  Bring water and mud repellant.  Only place that is hard to navigate is start if going CW and the soggy meadow (about 3/4 if going CCW) - stay to the right-ish. NTS Map: 082J15Elevation Gain: 150 m (492 ft).",
    "directions": "Take Hiway 22 (or hiway 8 from Calgary west) to Bragg Creek.  Cross the only bridge and turn left at the T.  Follow that all the way out (9km) to the Provincial Recreation area (road turns into gravel at rec area gates).  Follow the gravel to the parking lot at the end.  Trail starts from the middle of the north side of parking lot (to go counter-clockwise) or the road past the gate to go CW.",
