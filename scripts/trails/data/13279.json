    "description": "This is a hike to a small but picturesque fall near Drysdale Falls.  Actually there path I took goes right to Drysdale and then continues about 700m further west to Lucas Falls.The reason I called them Lucas is because of a fellow explorer who was kind enough to let me know about these falls.  The path from Drysdale falls is basically an old woods road who kind of disappears in a hemlock grove.  Once there aim for the small brook and follow it upstream to a 3ft drop followed by a 15-20 ft drop just upstream.",
    "directions": "Park at N45.62916\u00b0 W63.50780\u00b0 which is the same parking spot people use to access Drysdale falls.  Follow the well worn path to Drysdale.  Once there continue just a bit further upstream and to the west where a good logging road is located.  Once on it and following it south, you should see a fainter road on the right leading west and towards the falls which are located at; N45.62916\u00b0 W63.50780\u00b0",
