    "description": "Flywheel is a fun flowing trail, which has some built-up ramps, and some jumps at the top.\r\n  If you're riding Burke Mountain, it is a  good ride to finish on.",
    "directions": "Go to Port Coquitlam, turn on Coast Meridian Road, and go straight.  Go up a long hill till you get to Harper road, and turn right onto Harper (a gravel road).  Follow it till you get to a bend in the road and you will see an entrance to a trail on your right.  Get on your bike and ride!!",
