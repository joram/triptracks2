    "description": "Beautiful hike in the eastern Superstition Mountains.  Trail isn't particularly difficult but it's long if you do it as an out-and back.  Would avoid in the summer due to extreme heat.  You can shorten it and make a loop by following the old lost Wildcat Canyon trail, but I woudln't recommend it unless you are an expert route finder as the trail isn't maintained and at times almost impossible to find.",
    "directions": "Turn of I-60 just west of the To of the World, onto Pinto Mine Trail.  Follow the long curvy dirt road to the MIles Trailhead and start there.  I suggest using Google maps for navigation as there are many dirt roads in the area and it can be confusing.",
