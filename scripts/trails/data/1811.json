    "description": "A good moderate hike. Generally good trail, with some rooty, rocky and muddy stretches. You can go by skirting Dam Mountain (shorter, but rougher and muddier), and return by going over Dam Mountain (a bit longer, but more pleasant). Elevation gain from the Peak is 300 m, but most of that is in the last scramble up to the top of the summit. \nGood views of Crown Mtn, other surrounding mountains, English Bay from the summit, at 1400 m.",
    "directions": "This trail starts at the Peak, at the top of the Grouse Mountain Skyride, at the north end of Capilano Road in North Vancouver. There are 3 ways of getting up to the start: 1) Grouse Grind, 2 k, 800 m up, very busy, not so pleasant; 2) BCMC trail, approx 100 m further east from start of GG, 800 m up, 2.5 kms, much less busy, much more pleasant; 3) the Skyride, @ $30/adult, or $15 if you're a guest of someone who has a pass ($5 for ride down only).\nHead NW past the bear and wolf enclosure (look but don't feed), follow the same trail as towards Crown Mtn for approx 2 kms, but go right at the sign to Goat Mtn.",
