    "description": "Topo map: 1 N 10\r\nThis is a good mountain biking and hiking trail that leads to a great pond for swimming.\r\n\n(Editor's note:) According to the local trail guide which you can purchase around the St. John's bike shops (Avalon Mountain Bike Trail Guide), this is part of the Pippy Park trail system. It's ranked three out of four stars for difficulty.\r\n It's made popular due to its location, next to the St. John's Golf Course, and near the University.\r\nThe course has been described as rooty and slickrock with a mix of single track and double track, and gravel connector paths with some hills. There are a ton of route options, providing you with many variations on a theme.\r\n\r\nOn the south side of the gravel road, there are more trails, which were designed as XC ski loops during a snowier season.\r\n\r\nPlease be mindful of others, as this is a shared access trail system.\r\n\r\nShannon Burt\r\nEast Coast editor\nDirections to Trail\r\nAlong Route 1, or Outer Ring Road, look for Nagle's Hill Road, just past the Public Golf Course.",
