    "description": "This was a search for some climbing routes and boulders in an area west of Otter Lake just north of Lake Echo.   The good part about this hike is that once you clear the logged area close to the stream, you enter a seldom sen stretch of wood super close to the city.  Why is it so unvisited you may ask?    Its because it is some of the most unforgiving terrain to bush walk through.   The bushes and thickets are at least 5 to 8 feet high in some places and you feel like it would be far easier to try to crowd surf on top of them.  If ou do have some resilience and make it to the top of the hill in front of the starting point, you will discover some climbable cliffs and large boulders on the other side of the hill.",
    "directions": "Highly 7.  Turn on River Rd in Lake Echo and follow it as it becomes potholed and park by the large erratic boulder with graffitis on it.",
