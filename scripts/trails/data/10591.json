    "description": "Fun fast trail made up of packed dirt and rocks. Great for a recovery ride. A few rough sections but mostly fast smooth riding. Great for a light hardtail! Trail is very well marked and shows the flow of direction. Impossible to get lost just always remember that turning right will be a faster way home and turning left will be more technical sections. Always bring water since it is Arizona and is usually always warm/hot.For bike rentals: We rented in Scottsdale (near Phoenix) at AOA-adventures for great weekly rates on GIANT and Specialized, allowing you to ride nearby McDowell Preserve or South Mountain before heading to Sedona for more.",
    "directions": "Take I-10 west to Hwy 303 north. Go west on Olive Avenue for 4 miles to the park entrance.",
