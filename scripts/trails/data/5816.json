    "description": "The official Trail 26 is a relatively easy mountain bike trail. The interconnecting unofficial trails might be a bit more difficult. I do not know the exact length or time required to do all these trails but it would probably take under half a day to ride them.They can also be hiked, and in the winter snowshoed and cross country skied.See Map attached as a photo.",
    "directions": "The trail can be accessed from NCC Parking Lot P11 on West Hunt Club Road and P8 on Moodie Drive and from a bit North of P10 on Moodie Drive on other side of the road.",
