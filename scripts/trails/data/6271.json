    "description": "Fast and dusty ridge ride for an all mountain bike.  Great views down into and across the Fraser Valley.  Great for a group of enthusiastic downhill and cross country riders.  There are no big stunts and a short steep section that can be walked.  It is best shuttled from the road along the river up the forestry road about 2km to the North.\nThis trail is 30km South of :",
    "directions": "From Lillooet head South along the W Fraser Rd down the Eastern side of the Fraser River. Road name changes to Spencer Rd.  The turnoff up to the trail head is 30 km (almost exactly) from Hwy 99.  10 km (almost exactly) up switchbacks rising 800 m altitude up to a gate.  The ride starts about 20m back from the gate and follows the ridge SE down towards the river.",
