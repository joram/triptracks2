    "description": "This kayak route is great for an afternoon paddle, or as an optional overnighter becuase of all of the localized islands nearby. I launched at the beach where there is a parking lot and hiking trail, and paddled within the protected waters between Pole Rock and Duck Island. I even landed at Duck Island to have a look at the shed and the landscape.\nThere are lots of camping options all around you with both sandy and rocky but safe landing zones. Due to time, and solo paddling, I stayed out of the surf zones. But on a more adventurous outting, I think the location offers a lot of potential for fun and exploration of the rest of the island groups.\nIt just goes to show that Port Aux Basque isn't just a place to get to or come from because of the ferry schedule. You can spend some quality adventure time here.",
    "directions": "Off the TCH, take the Gand Bay West Road, turning right at Kyle's lane to access the beach.",
