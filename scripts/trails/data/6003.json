    "description": "An easy to moderate 1 km trail that starts in a replanted cut block and ends in old growth coastal rain forest on the shores of Douglas Channel.  This small rustic site has 3 tables, firepits and an outhouse.  From the beach, a short walk to a rocky outcrop gives further views of the Douglas Channel and Kitimat area. The site is walk in or boat access only.\nThere is a great viewpoint over the Douglas Channel to see inlets and islands in the distance. The trail drops approximately 100m vertical distance to the beach. It is an easy walk down, however a little more difficult coming back.\nThe area has several nice coves and you can use this to launch a kayak for exploring the channel. The next 8km paddling to the south will lead you to several bays, a river and some nice secluded coves.",
    "directions": "From Kitimat head south past the Alcan Smelter , turn right on the Bish Forest Service Road and drive south for about 8 km.  Directional signs are located about 1 km before the parking area at the trailhead. From the parking area it's another 1 km hike to the recreation site.",
