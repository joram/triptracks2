    "description": "A rugged trail following the shore that doesn't get a lot of use.  Some minor trees that had blown down needed to be climbed over but there was a crew actively maintaining the trail while we were there.  Eerie dead, salt blown trees along the trail (there's a name for this I think?)\nYou can see many seals frollicking in the waters of this cove and if you bring binoculars, out on the rock about 1000m off shore.\nThis may one day tie in with the East Coast Trail that can be found just North of here up in Cappahayden (look for the Round Cove B&B for a good trailhead and good place to stay.)",
    "directions": "From Renews - Cappahayden, drive about 13km SW and look for the well marked Provincial Park entry.  Drive 6km down the PP road to the parking area.  Trail follows the shores.",
