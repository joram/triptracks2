    "description": "Millcreek Ravine is a well maintained city trail, that offers surprisingly scenic and sheltered hiking within the bustling city of Edmonton.  While Ravines usually offer a great one-way experience, then having to back track on the same trail, Millcreek ravine offers two very different trails: one paved trail taking the high ground, and the other a more rugged venture through the ravine bottom on gravel and dirt paths. This is a great beginner walk or hike for those interested in starting hiking, but not interested in venturing out of the city.A full commentary on the ravine can be found at this link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mill_Creek_Ravine",
    "directions": "Millcreek Ravine can be accessed from either end.  The main trail heads would be Muttart Conservatory to the North, and Mill Creek Ravine park to the South.",
