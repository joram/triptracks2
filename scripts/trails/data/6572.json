    "description": "This GPS track leads you to a small and somewhat hidden waterfall on the upper reaches of this brook.  I have rated the hike as a 2 because there is a lot of deadfall to go through to reach the falls.  The falls themselves might be 15 feet.  This is not for the faint of heart.  There is a lot of dead tress to go over or under and reallistically I am not sure the falls are that impressive to warrant the effort to get there...but I am a sucker for punishment.  Facing the brook there are a lot of dirt roads on the right side of the stream which will save time and effort to reach the falls.  I was on some of those dirt roads to come back and this is reflected on the GPS tracks.  Good luck",
    "directions": "Take highway 224 to Middle Musquodoboit and continue approximately 3.7km past the Moose River Rd (on your right if coming from Halifax).  Park on side of the road where Kent Brook flows underneath and walk up the brook to falls.",
