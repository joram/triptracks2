    "description": "NTS Map: 092G14Powersmart is a popular trail just outside of Squamish that you get to by far from the golf course off Mamquam road.  Take the logging road up, and, park just past the municipal garage, which also near the golf course and a small kayak shop.  Shuttlers can park up above. Part of the trail now cuts through an area that has been clear-cut but overall it is still a classic ride.  If you shuttle, there is space to park up top.  Keep an eye out for other parked cars; we've marked the spot on our map, as well as the co-ordinate.  E-mail us for the key waypoints, or, stop in town at the local bike shop to ask about this and other local trails.  UTM above is the trailhead, but we have complete track..",
