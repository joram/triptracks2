    "description": "Description: Rubberhead started off as a single trail that has now expanded to include 18 trail sections, 10 of which were added in the fall of 2009. The expanded area offers a variety of downhill mountain bike options for intermedite to advanced riders. From steep and rooty to open and flowy, this system has something for everyone.  Toilet bowl is a blue run and has small drops and is tight trail in spots carved into the hill side, but for the most part a fast and flowing trail.",
    "directions": "Access: Travel east of Salmon Arm on Hwy 1 approx 4 km past the Federated Co-op mill. Turn right onto Forest Service Road (FSR) #110 just after a right corner on the highway and an info pullout on the left side of the highway. Follow the 110 Rd. up approx. 2.5 km where there is an old narrow skid road that goes up to the left. Park here. To continue to the trailhead, follow the 110 Rd. up to 8.2 km, and turn right, up the steep hill, and follow this road up to the next switch back. The trail starts from here and is marked. \nThe best approach is to shuttle from the 2.5km area of the 110 FSR. Here you will find parking and maps of the trail system. Trailheads range from 5km to 11kms up the mountain. Riding up is an option, but the road is on the steep side.",
