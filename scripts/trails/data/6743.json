    "description": "The Moosalamoo Trail is one of the trails to hike up to the summit of Moosalamoo Mtn which is located between East Middlebury and Forest Dale.  The one way is approximately 2.1 miles, Trailhead is 1503 ft and summit is 2553.6 ft per my handheld GPS.\n Trailhead is located at the parking lot of Moosalamoo camp ground, however, campground will be opened at May 28 time frame, thus, I had to walk 0.8 miles or so from the small area where I could park my car until I get to the trail head.  (Camp ground will be closed Sep.)\n Around 0.4 miles from Trail head, you cross North Branch Voters Brook bridge.  After then, the trail gradually ascent as you can see my elevation profile. Moosalamoo Trail eventually meets to Oak Ridge Trail junction sign, take turn left to reach to the summit of Moosalamoo Mtn.\n Originally, I had a plan to take different longer Trail to hike out, but, weather didn't seem to be perfect. So I changed my plan and hiked out exact same Trail.",
    "directions": "From Burlington, VT area, take Rt 116 (Hinesburg Rd) to South, then, take Rt 125, and take south off on Goshen Ripton Road which is unpaved road.  About 3.4 miles driving, you'll see sign of Moosalamoo campground at the right hand side.",
