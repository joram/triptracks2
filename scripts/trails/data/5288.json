    "description": "Trail starts at the Grotto Lake parking lot and then parallels the 1A highway behind the Baymag plant #2. It is 1.1kms from the parking lot to the creek bed where you head north and follow the creek bed for another km to the falls. The indian pictographs are just before the falls (on the left) and are fading fast so don't touch as the oils in our fingertips will accelerate the erosion of these 500-1000 year old paintings. From the falls you can continue further up the creek bed through a high walled corridor which eventually opens into a wide open valley. There are some hoodoos in here with a large cave at about the 3km mark. Bear sign quite evident in the area with large overturned stones, tracks, droppings, and at about the 4 km mark a very suggestive growl and some \"blowing\". I didn't venture any farther as I was soloing. A good half day hike where good footwear is a must. Plenty of water sources so bring a filter/purifier if you need to drink alot. I searched using several names but could not find this little jaunt anywheres in Trailpeak. If it is a copy I apologise. Hike safe!Editors Note: This is also doable as an ice hike up the canyon and ice climbing for the properly equipped and trained.",
    "directions": "From Calgary take the 1A though Cochrane and Exshaw, or for  faster & safer drive, go West on TC #1 to the Seebe exit, go North then turn left on 1A for 10.9km.  The Grotto Mountain Day Use area is on the North side of the highway and well marked. Trailhead is in the parking lot with an information board at the start.",
