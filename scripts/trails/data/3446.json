    "description": "A hike/scramble up the wide and rocky bed of a shallow creek.  The trail occasionally wanders into the bush or along the ridge, but is essentially the creek bed.  A few kms up you will reach some cool hoodoos, which is a great spot for pictures and picnics.  Continue past these and along a more challenging trail to reach a cave further up the trail.  Bring a flashlight if you want to explore it.",
    "directions": "About 3 km south of Windy Point on Highway 11.  There is no formal parking area, so we just parked along the side of the road.  Look for a wide and rocky creek bed. That's the trail.",
