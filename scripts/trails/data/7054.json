    "description": "This is a great way to pass the time while you're in Port Aux Basque either waiting for the ferry or just getting off. The trail starts off with a long interpretive boardwalk that explains some of the geography, fauna and ship wreck history from the area.\nThe trail turns the edge of the shore and continues as a beach walk / cart trail return. I managed to hike 4 K worth not taking the time to continue up the shore along the beach. Avoiding as much of the delicate dune system, I was able to find an access point and double back on the cart road on the land side of the dunes back to the beach parking lot.\nThis is a nice place for a stroll, or if you want access to a more remote beach area.\nShannon Burt\nEastcoast Editor",
    "directions": "Off the TCH  route 1, take the turn to Grand Bay West, and follow the main road toward the beach where there is a parking lot and signage. (follow Grand Bay West Road, and take Kyle Lane to the beach.)",
