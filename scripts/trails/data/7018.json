    "description": "Stanleyville is a short distance day hike / backcountry destination within the southern portion of Gros Morne National Park in an area called Lomond. It is well suited for a quick get away as well as for those looking for a brief shake down run, or who are new to taking it all on your back to get out for a night.\nYou might think that an alternative to the \"high road\" might be to take the shore way around. I thnk you would almost get there this way, except for one or two places where the rock walls go vertical to the shore. If you don't mind getting a little wet, I think you could make it.\nThe path is well groomed with step infrastructure, bridges and a narrow gravel path.  It arches up and over a huge hill and deposits you along the shores of the eastern arm of Bonne Bay. There are a couple of picnic tables and a pit privy. The views of Killdevil Mountain across the water and the surrounding shores are breathtaking for such a short distance away from the trailhead. This route has a big bang for such little effort.\nOnce you get settled in, go explore the coastline. There you?ll see bits of basalt in bazaar formations.  Oh, and here?s a great tip to pass the time, the rocks there on shore are perfect for skipping.\nShannon Burt\nEast coast editor",
    "directions": "From route 430, take the 431 where you will reach Lomond. (12-15K down the road) Follow the signage that takes you along a dirt road into the picnic area. The trail head is alon the upper left, and the boat launch us along the lower right.",
