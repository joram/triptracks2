    "description": "This is a bushwhack hike to a small but unexpected waterfall.  The only reason I ended up exploring here is after I saw an entry for a fall somewhere along this brook.  The entry was in a book written by Wally Ellison. It didn't give any coordinates but had enough information to send me to this brook. I heard that Wally passed away in 2018.  I really wish I had the chance to meet him and talk waterfalls and explorations in Cape Breton. I looked at the topo map and decided on two different points along the stream that could have the potential for a fall. I set off from McIntyre Rd and followed the brook downstream.  The valley gets deep and pretty scenic quickly but unfortunately the fall only appears towards the end of the brook which I could have accessed more quickly if I had known where the fall was located.  Here you go...the fall is at;  N45.71413\u00b0 W61.34579\u00b0.  There was a bridge just downstream of it but I just bushwhacked back to the TCH.",
    "directions": "Trans Canada highway from Port Hastings towards Baddeck.  Turn right on McIntyre Rd.  The brook flows under the road in the first 200m.  Follow the brook down to the coordinates above or better yet..try to find the road that leads to the bridge I saw in the woods.",
