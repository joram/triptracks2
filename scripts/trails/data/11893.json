    "description": "This is a cool short but very steep hike to the bottom of a gorge.  If you do it right then its just a short hike upstream to a beautiful 70ft fall.  I had been here almost ten years ago and since then the logging road has gotten worse but there is a new flagged route (blue tape) to the bottom of the falls which makes it easier to navigate.  The first time around I had hike to the top of the falls and had to be very careful to descend on the side.  The forest in the upper reaches is usually wide open as it is in a hemlock stand.  the bottom is more mixed.",
