    "description": "NTS Map: 082G01Elevation gain - 530 m (1,750 ft). Time and distance are returnThe hike to Goat Lake in Waterton Lakes National Park starts as an easy stroll along the Snowshoe Trail.  This section of the trail (4.6 km) is also very easy to bike on.  There were a few stream crossing in mid-May when we went but stepping on rocks allowed us to stay dry.  Once you reach the fork in the trail (there is a sign directing you to the right for Goat Lake) the trail becomes much more steep and exposed, you will have to leave your bikes behind here.  There is some scree near the top but the trail zig zags up the mountain so it isn't bad.  Lots of wildflowers along the trail and we saw a mountain goat across the valley.Distance is one way.",
    "directions": "Drive up Red Rock Road in Waterton NP and park at the end.  There is a large parking lot and a large trailhead sign so you can't miss it.",
