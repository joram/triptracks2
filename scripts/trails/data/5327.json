    "description": "There are a lot of trails at French Fort Cove, I will do my best to post a trail map here and a GPS ride too.  The trails are tight singletrack, tight and flow. The best thing to do is check in with the local shop, Incline Sports for directions.\nThere is a local mountain bike club responsible for all the development and they are launching www.bikemiramichi.com early 2009. \nCurrent conditions:",
    "directions": "The parking lot on Route 8 by Kawasaki and Chrysler is the best place to start. You will see a trail map posted where you should enter. Enter 1119 King George Highway, Miramichi, NB E1V 5J7 in Google maps for driving directions.",
