    "description": "Edwards Rating: III (IV) S M This is an incredible scramble, a real one: Great exposure half of the time, lots of hands on scrambling, narrow ridge walks, down climbing, scree, lose rocks, etc. You definitely need some route finding, bushwhacking and scrambling experience to do that one. In Nugara?s book, it is rated difficult and I would totally agree. My spouse had no problem with all the exposed sections and she would rate it as moderate. You?ll know what your level of comfort is quite fast since the first section of its ridge is the crux. Start off the same trail than Wasootch Peak hike and keep going until you reach the ridge. When the views open on your right and you see this wide scree slope, you can start hiking straight through it gaining a bit of elevation but not too much since you want to pass under an outcrop. Keep going in the nice shale rocks until you reach the Wasootch-Kananaskis Peaks col. You can summit at Wasootch, but it?s a long day of technical scrambling and since we did it the week before, we couldn?t care less at this point.Once on the col, this is an easy walk to the crux. You will see a little scree slope on your right with dangerous exposure. Avoid it as much as you can by skirting the rock on its left. You?ll find some weaknesses there but this is more of a climbing scramble as you will see. If you think you can?t down climb that section, don?t go further. You will have some other challenges after the crux. Once past it, you will have to take the next outcrop on its left. It seems like the trail goes on the right side, but footing is not so good with deadly exposure. Next to that is more of an exposed ridge walk, a beautiful one! You will reach out the false summit and see the highest peak a few minutes away with again some exposure.We headed down on the right side of the summit to do GR338442, an unnamed peak in Nugara?s book. It is again some moderate hands on scrambling with a bit of route finding. Once at that peak, we went down on its right until we saw a scree slope with an obvious trail going down to a dried-up creek bed, a very narrow one. We decided to go down all the way until we reached the active creek down in the valley. From there, route finding and bushwhacking again since the flood may have destroyed some sections of the trail on the right side of that creek. Once at the end of the cliff on our right, we bushwhacked up to the main trail.I recommend doing only Kananaskis Peak and go down one of the gullies pretty close to the summit. It?s an easy way down, but be careful with the rock bands in the scree slopes. Elevation of 987 m NET, 1163 m TOT and max 2432 m for Kananaskis Peak & 2275 m for GR338442 Peak 7 to 11 hours",
    "directions": "From Calgary, follow Trans-Canada Hwy/AB-1 W to Kananaskis Trail/AB-40 S. Take exit 118 and start your odometer for a 23 km drive, such is just before the Kananaskis Village turnoff. Make a U-turn and park on the east side of the road, close to the dried-up creek bed.",
