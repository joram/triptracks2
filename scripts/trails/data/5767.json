    "description": "A moderately steep but well marked trail up the back side of Gunstock Mountain.  \r\rPark at gate and hike up road crossing brook, trail is on the left and blazed with white marks.  Follow the blazes to the summit. 3/4 the way up the blazes become a little harder to follow but they are there and the trail can be followed with care.  Great views from the top, and peace and quiet in the off season.",
    "directions": "US 3 to 11A in Gilford. Head northeast and then right onto Belknap Mountain Road, follow for just over 2 miles and then go left on Carriage Road, park at the gate.",
