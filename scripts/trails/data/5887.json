    "description": "A standard slick rock trail in the Moab Area, among the flatter and easiest in the area.  Monitor & Merrimac Trail is so named as it provides a good look at (and access to) nearby Monitor & Merrimac buttes.\nIt features a lariat shape (loop with a tail), is well signed, 6 or 7 miles long (or more if you take the spur to M+M) and under 200m (660 feet) cumulative climbing.  If you want to ease into the slick rock scenario, you want a short after supper ride or any other reasons you want to take it easy, this is a good choice.\nAlong it's length is a gen-u-ine historic stage coach stop that you can see the bottom 1/2 of the original stoppin' house. You're also in the 'hood of Mill Canyon Dinosaur Trail where you can see Dino's foot prints in the sedimentary rock.",
    "directions": "Drive about 20.7 km North of Lions Park (Highway 128 corner) at the North end of Moab.  Turn left (West) and drive about 1km or less to a well marked trailhead.\nAccommodations:\n\n A lot of people in the MOAB area stay at condos managed by www.moabutahlodging.com, speak with Andrea. They offer a range of in town homes to budget and upscale condos.",
