    "description": "This is an excellent hike with some of the best views around.  If you are wanting to visit the monument after bagging the peak you are looking at another 3 hours to complete.  The trail head is well marked, and the trail is well-defined.  The trail gets into the switchbacks right away and doesn't quit until you are past the treeline, and then it is up, up, up with plenty of scree and talus to negotiate.  There is a water source on the way to the monument, but not before (see gpx file).",
    "directions": "Before getting into Valemount on Hwy 5 there is a turn-off on your left heading onto an forest service road, where the signage is pretty good getting to the 'parking lot' at the trail head.",
