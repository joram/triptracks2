    "description": "Edwards Rating: III (III) M MElevation is 1196 metres and max 3054 m at the top officially.About 4-6 hours return if you go on a moderate/steady pace.***Another incredible scramble in Kananaskis for the views as you are surrounded by lakes, meadows and a 360 view of the Rockies! Technically considered as a moderate scramble, I thought it was quite easy.This is a very easy approach by Chester Lake trail. Once close to the lake and a few minutes after the view has opened wide on the meadows and Chester Peak, look to your right and you'll see a \"bridge\" over the creek, that's where the scrambling starts. The trail is still obvious while you are approaching a large gully you'll have to hike straight up to the col. Once at the col, you will see the trail going left and a lot of cairns from there. I didn't follow the cairns but rather scrambled up wherever it made sense to me. Lots of fun!",
    "directions": "The trailhead is obvious on the Smith-Dorrien/Spray Lakes Road, 20km north of the junction of the Kananaskis Lakes Road in Peter Lougheed Provincial Park.",
