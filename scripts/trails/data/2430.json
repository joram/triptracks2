    "description": "NTS Map: 082J07It's hike number 260 in \"Kananasksis Country Trail Guide\" by Gillean Daffern.It's about 500 meters of vertical in a 3.5 km walk up the trail that starts in forests and ends with wide open vistas above the tree line. The trail winds through the forest before breaking out in the open grassy area.You can continue through the pass to Trapp Creek for a much longer hike. Great views to the west including Holy Cross Mountain. It's an open area that is frequently clear of snow both early and late in season. Beware though it can be windy.The crocuses and shooting stars were already blooming the first weekend in May.",
    "directions": "From Longview take Highway 541 west to Sentinel day use area. There is a small trail to cross the road, then head east to find the trail heading north. GPS data is attached.",
