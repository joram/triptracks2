    "description": "This is a shorty but a goody. Not far from highway 7 is a super unassuming brook.  I was lucky to follow in the footstep of someone like me who likes to explore.  Chritopher sinclair shared this location with me!  The small brook is nestled into a beautiful mature everreen ravine.  The fall itself is only about 8-10ft but the short journey and beautiful ravine make I worthwhile.",
    "directions": "Highway 7 near Aspen.  A dirt road at     45.33165, -62.05359 also called Goshen Fishers Mills Rd on google map.  Drive about 700m or hike.  At the brook crossing, follow it upstream for about 300m to the fall.;",
