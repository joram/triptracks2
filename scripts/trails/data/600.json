    "description": "This is a short section of the East Coast Trail. The trail follows the coastline, slightly above sea level.\r\n\r\nNote: don't forget to have a car waiting for you at the other end of the trail if you don't want to walk back. This is not a loop.  There is GPS data attached to this trail (see \"download GPS\"), which if loaded into your GPS can help you find route points.\r\n\r",
