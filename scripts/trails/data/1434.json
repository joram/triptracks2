    "description": "This trail leads from a small parking lot at  the trailhead right beside the St. John River. It enters a mixed forest stand, and has a gentle uphill grade. The trail eventually comes out at the Number 2 divided highway, but along the way, passed through a large gully where spur trails lead to the base and head of a waterfall.The waterfall's head (Hayes falls) has safety fencing and picnic tables for the public. The view from the top is nice. At the bottom, you see a great view of the falls. My first time completing the trail was done during the winter, so the ice buildup makes a prime site for an easy and fun ice climb, (lots of anchor potential at the top) and a great winter camping spot to boot.In all, the trail is a great afternoon day hike venture that anyone could enjoy.For the climbing inclined, there are several ice lines in the vacinity. Look for it in mid to late December.",
