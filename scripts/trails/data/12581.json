    "description": "Little Brehat is a community that was resettled some years ago. The little Cove is the only protection from the Open Atlantic Ocean, where whales and Icebergs can be seen from.Some of the families who lived there included The Pilgrims, Richards, Colbourne?s, Penney?s, Cull?s, Noble?s, & Patey?s. Now all that remains is two small cabins and a graveyard, which is a little difficult to traverse to, but is quite possible, be careful. If you choose to go this way, take some time to explore the surrounding coast as the views of the coastline and sea stacks are amazing.The hike is relatively easy, not much elevation change, some muddy sections, and some newer wooden walking sections. It is worth the hike as the scenery is beautiful.",
    "directions": "Drive to Great Brehat, Take a left when the community splits and park somewhere near the end. The trail to Little Brehat starts before the other small walking trails at the end of the community.",
