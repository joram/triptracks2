    "description": "This is a typical Canadian Shield environment, with lots of rock hills and valleys.  It can be very wet in spring, with lots of bugs in summer.  The best time is in the fall.  Camping spots have primitive toilets and bear boxes for food.  You will require water treatment to purify lake water.  And excellent trip. There is GPS data attached to this trail (see \"download GPS\"), which if loaded into your GPS can help you find route points.",
    "directions": "See GPS co-ords.  North of Hwy 1 in the Whiteshell.",
