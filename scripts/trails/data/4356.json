    "description": "Mission's Heritage has a complex system of trails that can accommodate every type of rider. The Mission, or more correctly, monastery, in the middle of town is perched on the top of Mount Mary Ann on the east side of the park.  The single track trails weave through the tree'd mountain park. \nGlen's loop is the main access trail for all the western trail heads while Jacob's ladder will lead you to the eastern end. \nSalamander Trail is the return trail that runs along the bottom and all upper trails exit here.\nOther trails in this area include Hail Mary, The Gondola, Blaspheme, Hell's Gate and The Monastery.",
    "directions": "The trail can be accessed 200 meters along Prentis Ave in Mission, on the right hand side of the street.",
