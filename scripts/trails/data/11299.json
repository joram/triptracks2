    "description": "Edwards rating: I (II) M SWinter is already there, so I try to find hikes with less exposure and \"avalanches safe\", this is a good one for sure! Rewarding with views of the Valley and Canmore, Three Sisters-Windtower--Pigeon-Allan, name it! Great rewarding views for the effort, between 12-13 km return.Trail: You start at Skogan Pass/Centennial Ridge parking lot at Dead Man's Flats exit on Highway 1. You take the main trail for approximately 700 m. Then you will have to take the right trail and cross 2 creeks at that point. After approx. 600 m you arrive at another intersection. Then, you can even decide to keep going or turn right (this would be the shorter way up). Those 2 trails will meet again later as they form a loop, just before the last portion to the open slope. On the left, it is West Wind Ridge Trail. On the right, Wind Ridge Trail. West Ridge trail will bring you to another intersection where you want to take the trail to your right. You'll see the trail leading to the open slope and the ridge about 2.4 km later, a bit more on the West Trail. Then, trail will be obvious (in summer I suppose...!), try to stay close to the tree line on the ridge for less exposure. When you arrive at the rock band, you can either choose to climb it or take it on the right side, there is a narrow path and steep trail leading to the same point, before the last slope to hike to the peak. It was icy-snowy when I did it, so I took the trail around, but it must be a fun scramble in summer time.Elevation gain 724 m, max elevation 2128 m.",
    "directions": "From Highway 1, you take exit 98 to Dead Man's Flats, then you go South on George Biggy Sr Rd, you will find the parking lot at the end of this road, onto your right. It's right beside the entrance of Banff Gate Mountain Resort.",
