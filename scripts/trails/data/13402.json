    "description": "Left Vancouver at 5:30AM, started skinning at 9AM. We got up near the snowline and had very little to hike before strapping skis on.  We had a short skin up through the forest to gain a ridge, less than an hour. On the ridge the views were stunning. The day was perfectly clear maybe on a warmer side. Following the ridge we had several rocky sections to navigate but most of it was easy skinning. After gaining the foot of the mountain we climbed the east face to the summit, all on skins apart from crossing one rocky section. We reached summit after 5 hours, the views were spectacular from there. We spent about 30 mins there, having lunch and soaking in the views. There are several routes to ski down, we chose same route we climbed which is probably the easiest, traversing along side the ridge. We had to put the skins back on  for the short section to re-gain the ridge and skied down the same track. We walked from the snowline to the cars and ended up there after around 9 hours. Very fun spring skiing!",
    "directions": "Drive to Pemberton, follow Pemberton Meadows Road, turn left to Miller Bench Road and follow that forest service road for 11.5 km, or to the snowline. There are quite deep waterbars along so high clearance 4x4 vehicle is a must. I have a GPX track of the FSR drive, please contact me for the one (not sure if I can upload 2 tracks).",
