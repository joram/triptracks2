    "description": "The Enchanted Forest is located on South Pender Island, on Spalding Road. There is a waterfall (dry in the summer) and a lookout overlooking Bedwell Harbour. The forest is walking distance to or from Poets Cove Resort and Spa. There are three paths which start from Spalding Road, all eventually connect to each other. It is a relatively small area, but easy to get lost with so many paths interconnecting. There are some signs but they are difficult to see as they blend into the surroundings.",
    "directions": "On South Pender Island, driving South on Spalding Road, the trail head is on the right hand side before the sharp corners leading up to Poet's Cove. There is some space on the right hand side of the road to pull off. Be careful, as there is lots of traffic in this area especially in the summer, and the trailhead is right before a blind corner.",
