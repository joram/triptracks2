    "description": "A very easy and short trail that leads to Dawson Falls.  It takes an hour if you take your time, but is worth the short stroll.  the falls are very cool and there are a few spots along the way to take pictures.",
    "directions": "follow the clearwater valley road north from clearwater BC.  This is the road that leads into Wells Grey park.  The Dawson Falls trailhead is on the east side of the road, about 41 km up the highway from clearwater.  stop at the info booth at the intersection of the yellowhead and Clearwater Valley road and get a park map.  they are free and useful.",
