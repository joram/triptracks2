    "description": "Placenta is a fast flowing single track through the trees.  It is steep and windy with a couple of hucks.  There is a lot of bang for your buck on this one; the trail seems to go forever.  Warm up your fore arms and check your brake pads.  This one can be dusty if it has been dry for awhile.",
    "directions": "Check with one of the local bike shops (Sacred Ride, Gerrick's)Note: GPS data is for a loop riding up from the bottom (Bottoms Up > Upper Bottoms > Placenta > Fat Tire DH).",
