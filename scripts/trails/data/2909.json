    "description": "NTS Map: 082J14\nThis trail is right beside:\nStarting from the *very* popular Ribbon Creek Parking Lot, this network of trails has it all.  It can be a popular place but there is enough choices that it doesn't feel crowded.\nThere are several other trails starting from the same parking lot so you can tailor your day to your what ever you want.  Like most of Kananaskis Country, there is no shortage of signs so don't worry about getting lost.\nIt was all skier set tracks but the snow was great and the tracks were holding up well.  There is also a good mix of up and down.  The trails are all Green & Blue, reasonably gentle, nothing a few herringbones won't fix.  You can make a couple mini-loops if you want some fresh.",
    "directions": "West of Calgary on #1 to hiway 40 (Nakiska / Kananaskis Village).  South for 23 km to the K-co village road where  you turn right.  2km in to the Ribbon Creek parking area.  Start on either the Terrace Trail (trailhead on SE corner of furthest west parking lot. or Ribbon Creek (SW corner of same lot).",
