    "description": "Hike, or quad, your way up on the logging roads. Hike into the forest and follow the orange markers to the unnamed lake. This lake sits in a bowl with a nice peak over looking the lake and, on the other side, Narrows Inlet. We attempted the peak but turned back after only half the way due to safety for the kids.We used quads to get very near the top (logging roads). So our hike was only about 1km 'as a crow flies'.  This took us about 1hr to walk.",
    "directions": "Jakes Landing is water access only. We arrived using my landing craft which  I also used to pre-drop 2 quads and a mini-truck. Kayak from Sechelt (1 day) or from Egmont (much closer but you have to go through Sechelt Rapids). Jakes Landing is a short stretch of cottages backing onto one or more large  private parcels - which, in turn, back onto crown land. There is a public  section about mid-way along and this is used for landing boats etc.",
