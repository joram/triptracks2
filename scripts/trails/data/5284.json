    "directions": "The trail head is on a road with no official parking. Until there is parking, access by auto will not be described.\nEditor's Note:   Still, I think we'll have to tell people how to get there even if they're walking or biking.  Take Highway 11 North of Orillia (about 15km from the tracks) to County Road 52 at Severn Bridge.  Turn East and go 2.5km  South & East on #52 to Riverdale Road.  Turn South and follow Riverdale Road 2.6km to trail area.",
