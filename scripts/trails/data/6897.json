    "description": "This is a very easy trail to a series of ochre beds in Kootenay National Park, after crossing the Kootenay River on a very good supension bridge. The three 'pots' are formed by the accumulation of iron oxide around the outlets of 3 cold mineral springs. Native tribes used the ochre for paint. White settlers mined the ochre beds until the late 20's.\nIt's a good idea to keep your distance from the yellow liquid, it doesn't come off! One other thing that I noticed was that trees that fell into the creek were decaying much faster than those which fell into a normal creek.",
    "directions": "Kootenay National Park about 30km north of Kootenay Park vistor centre at Kootenay Park Lodge. Signs right on the highway.",
