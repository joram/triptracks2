    "description": "On the edge of the Charlevoix?s crater\nThe topography of Charlevoix has been shaped 360 million years ago by a 15 billion Tonnes  meteorite. The body hit exactly at the joint between the Canadian Shield and the St-Lawrence Lowlands. I read somewhere that it made a 9 km deep hole. Today, the crater makes 56 km in diameter.  \nHiking on the edge of the crater from the Canadian Shield side offers spectacular views.   The one selected here is a 10 km  loop circuit call Lac a l?Empeche.  On one of the pictures, you can see Le Mont Des Eboulements, which is the center of the crater.",
    "directions": "From Baie-St-Paul to St-Urbain on the 138.  Left turn on road 381.  You drive 24 km from the church of St-Urbain to reach the entrance of the Zec des Martres.",
