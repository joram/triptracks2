    "description": "This is part of Mount Wells Regional Park, but a side trail with less elevation gain. The trail can be quite muddy in the winter. The arbutus trees and mossy rocks are lovely. Where the trail forks, you can go right and up to the top of Flatty Hill, or left which circles down along the river and back to where you started.",
    "directions": "*As of January 2018, Google Maps will not direct you here correctly, as it has not updated it's map to include the new traffic circle and housing development.*From Westshore Parkway, take the exit for Meridian Road off the traffic Circle. Turn onto Irwin Road, then left onto Creekside Trail, continue right up the hill, then turn right again onto Ravens View Drive. The trailhead is on the right hand side just below the cul-de-sac where Ravens View Drive ends.",
