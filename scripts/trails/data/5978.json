    "description": "Set inside the Quarry Wilderness Park, this twenty-three acre CVRD Community park is located on the east side Cobble Hill Mountain and was once the site of the Cobble Hill Lime Quarry. This once productive industrial site has now given way to a rich and diverse plant and wildlife community, which grow and flourish around the historical features of this park. Park Features include: Walking Trails, Scenic Views, Historical Site, Picnic Sites, Nature Identification, Park Interpretive Signage, Habitat and Wildlife. The park is rich in bird life, some species reside year round and others are seasonal. Birds that call the park home at one time or another include: Pileated Woodpeckers, Hairy Woodpeckers, Swansons Thrush, Varied Thrush, Stellars Jay, Northern Flickers, Robins, various types of Sparrows, Goshawks, and many others species.The rich vegetation and habitat provide ideal conditions for Red Squirrels, Black Tailed Deer, Chipmunks, Raccoons, and the occasional Black Bear. The area is primarily mixed coniferous fir, cedar and hemlock, with some deciduous maple and alder trees.",
    "directions": "Turn off Hwy #1 onto Cobble Hill Road or Shawnigan Lake Road both lead to Cobble Hill. The parking lot is next to the train tracks and across the street from the landmark Cobble Hill furniture store.",
