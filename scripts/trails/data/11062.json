    "description": "The forest consists of Douglas-fir, wet areas of red alder, salmonberry, and skunk cabbage. The concrete footings and a few of wooden piers from the old Comox Logging trestle of the early 1900?s can still be seen at the edge of the river. Black bears are frequently seen in and around the park. The park is within the floodplain of the Tsolum River with access to the river. The distance from the parking lot to the swimming beach is 637m.",
