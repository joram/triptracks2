    "description": "This is a beauty of a fall nesteled in the hills near Argyle.  There is even a small hand painted sign at the start of an atv trail calling it Falls Rd!Chris Sinclair pointed me in the right direction on this one ..Tks!   The fall is also clearly visible in google earth.  The start is on an ATV trail in a blueberry field.  Once the trail enters the forest, aim for the river and follow it upstream,  Try to get to the left side (facing upstream) as it is WAY easier to walk than the other side.The fall is just orgeous with three tiers in a dark and high canopied evergreen stand.  Fal is at; N45.38650 W61.91004",
    "directions": "Highway 316 towards Argyle. Turn on Argyle Rd and park at stream crossing and ATV path at; N45.38208 W61.91790",
