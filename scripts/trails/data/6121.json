    "description": "The Yellowhawk trail is the perfect trail to take the children on, the trail is well marked and winds up gently through the timber into the alpine. There are old cabin ruins near the summit of the trail and then a short hike can take you to the North East side of Mount Greenberry where you can get an excellent view of Spectacle Lakes on the Bowron Lake Chain or a short hike through the valley North to Mount Murray takes you to the Jubilee trail summit where you can make a round trip back down towards the Bowron Lake Road. Keeping in mind once back to the road you will have a 2.8 km walk along the Bowron Lake Road back to the Yellowhawk Trail head.",
    "directions": "Take Hwy 26 off of Hwy 97 from Quesnel to Wells, 5 kms out of Wells Take the Bowron Lake Road for 3.5 kms. Trail Head is well marked with a parking area and sign marking the trail.",
