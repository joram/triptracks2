    "description": "A short afternoon hike to some beautiful waterfalls and big old trees. Rated difficult because of an indistinct trail and lots of steep ground up and down.",
    "directions": "Off Black Powder Range Road, which is the first right turn past Coombs Country Candy headed east out of town on Hwy 4. It's a gravel road with a great big ORANGE gate in the shade at the start. From there take the first left, and keep turning left until you get to a dead end big enough to get turned around in. That's one trailhead. Look around it is tricky to find and follow in the dense second growth forest. Oh ya! This is private land here. So don't mess it up! It's beautiful! I had to shoot it. Enjoy the jpgs.The second entrance is a little harder to find, but it's shorter, but it's steeper. Anyway, it's exactly one kilometer up the Hump heading eastward.",
