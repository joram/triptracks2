    "description": "Awesome downhill trail that hardly gets ridden as it involves riding up  Blackcomb mountain to almost the top of the Blackcomb Gondola.\nThe trail itself from top to bottom (not including the up hill hike to the trail  head) is about 2.7kms long. At a guess, I would say that approx 75% of that  is nice, steep, tech downhill. \nI do not recommend taking your cross country bike down this one. Although, If you don't want to push your bike the whole way up to the trail head, then you will need something you can pedal up hill on.",
    "directions": "There is a couple ways up. You can go up Glacier Drive and keep riding past the sliding center up the  mountain summer access trail.\nOr you can go straight up the ski run from the base of blackcomb till you  reach another summer access road.\nEither way it's a decent uphill slog to reach just under the top of the  Blackcomb Gondola. There will be a big sweeping right hand corner in the  road, just below the top of the Gondola. Look for the trail on the edge of that  corner. I think the corner has a marker right next to the Trail Head,  identifying the corner as 3.5 (I think...I will update next time I ride it)",
