    "description": "NTS Map:92K3.  An 8km trail starts off in an over grown field of blackberries for about 15 minutes.  It then heads into the woods for the rest of the trail, which makes up for the beginning (now fixed).  The end of trail, up to the summit, includes a large set of sturdy stairs. The end of the trail takes you overlooking Seymour Narrows where you can see to the Quadra Island, the mainland and view of ships passing by, if you time it right you can even see cruise ships go by and practically shake a tourists hand.  The narrows is less than a kilometer wide and you are quite high so the view is really nice.  The largest non-nuclear explosion in the world happened here to get rid of the marine hazaard.",
    "directions": "On Vancouver Island take the Island Highway north past Campbell River.  About 10 minutes past Bloedel you will see it on your right.  Avoid parking in the parking lot since a lot of break-ins occur here.  Park on the shoulder on the highway and you should be fine.",
