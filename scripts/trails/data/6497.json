    "description": "Canoe (or boat) then hike to Mattawas fabled 3 crosses. Located directly across the Ottawa River from the historic town of Mattawa, the 3 crosses placed at the top of this Laurentian Mountain, tower over the community. Park at the Mattawa Marina and paddle across to the rocky shore just upstream from the train bridge. The Southerly trail is less steep and better suited for the climb. The northerly trail is much steeper and not suitable for children or dogs. The views from the 3 crosses are simply spectacular, with the Ottawa River Town of Mattawa and surrounding landscape unfolding in front of you. \rCanoe rentals are available from Algonquin North Outfitters located on Kiosk Rd outside of Mattawa. Local tourism information available at www.visitmattawa.travel\r",
    "directions": "The town of Mattawa is located on Highway 17, approx. 65km East of North Bay and 300km NW of Ottawa. When entering the town follow signs to the Museum, the Marina and Museum share a parking lot. Take a stroll in downtown Mattawa before or after your hike.",
