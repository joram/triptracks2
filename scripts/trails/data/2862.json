    "description": "NTS Map: 082J14Another great little loop, perfect for beginner snowshoe users.  The loop as defined is 4.5km.  but there is some interesting side trips you can make while exploring that can add a few more kms on.  It also appears to be backcountry skiing central, there were a great many skiers prepping in the area.The attached GPS data only bears a slight resembelence to the trail as shown on the K-co Snowshoe map (below) we kinda made our own way.  That being said, we were always on 'A' trail and had a great time.  There are many, many alternate routes through here and you will enjoy all of them.The views really are wonderful and the route is well wind sheltered with several sunny spots to stop for sustinance or scenery.Click Here  for a map of PLP.

    "directions": "This one can be got to from either end of K-country.  Either go to canmore and take the Smith-Dorien Trail (road) South for 44km or drive to Peter Lougheed Provincial Park (50 km S of Hiway 1 on Hiway 40) and take the Smith-Dorien Trail (road) North for a further 20.4 km.  Either way you're looking for the Burstall Pass trailhead / parking lot.  Snowshoe trail starts on North-West end of lot.",
