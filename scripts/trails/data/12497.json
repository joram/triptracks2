    "description": "This was a three day backpacking trip with the two nights camping at Upper Michele Lake.Our approach up Owen Creek was very challenging. Be prepared for 3 km of scrambling along steep creek-side cliffs and rock hopping in the creek itself.The Upper and Lower Michele lakes are absolutely beautiful, and a popular fishing spot for Golden Trout. The drop-off from the outlet of the lower lake is very dramatic. On our middle day, we hiked over the next pass (the highest on the Great Divide Trail at 2590 metres) and spent the day exploring the waterfalls dropping in from the west.",
    "directions": "The Owen Creek trailhead is 1.6 km east of the Banff National Park gates on Highway 11.",
