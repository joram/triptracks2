    "description": "At 10,466 feet, Mount Cleveland is the tallest peak in Glacier National Park, Montana.\nWe hiked for about 1 hour from Goat Haunt on the Waterton Valley Trail before reaching a small bridge corresponding to the creek described in Gordon Edward's guidebook. We started the bushwacking, as he described in his book and managed to find what we thought was the Mystical Elk Trail. That trail brought us straight to Camp Creek where we did not want to go and then disappeared on us. We then bushwacked for 2.5 hours up to the base of the West bowl were we managed to find a flat area to set up the tents at 6,020 feet. \nWe left camp the following day at 6:20 and started to climb the scree on the south end of the bowl to get to the west ridge then traversed to the west bowl at about 7,700 feet. The rest was a series of rock bands fairly easy to climb (class 3) to reach the summit ridge (10,000 feet) where the view of the east horizon is gorgeous. The last bit before the summit is a ridge boogie. There were very obvious signs of grizzly activity there! (Grizzlies eat the moth larva which are found on the summit).\nThe view from the summit is spectacular... We down climbed the same way and got to the camp at 14:30. It took only 2.5 hours to get back to the boat by following the drainage below the big waterfall from camp down to Camp Creek. We walked along the creek as long as it was possible. After that we went back into the forest but stayed at lower elevation where we followed several different small trails.\n[Editor's note: For an alternative ascent, the Stony Indian route is also listed on Trailpeak (see Mount Cleveland (Montana)]",
    "directions": "We took the 10:00 am boat from Waterton townsite (Alberta), after getting an undesignated campsite permit.  We had to show passports at Goat Haunt and started the hike at 11:30.",
