    "description": "NTS Maps: 082O03,082O04,082OElevation Gain: 360 mGoat Creek Trail is a nice, easy 18km (one way) bike trail from Canmore to Banff (or vice versa or both). Easy if you start at the Canmore end. There is 1000' of elevation drop from there to Banff, with the odd uphill section. The trail follows a dirt trail at the beginning and widens to an old road by the end, with numerous bridge crossings in between. Ends at the Banff Springs Hotel parking lot. Lots of hikers (walkers) near the Banff end.\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n      \t\r\n\r",
    "directions": "From Canmore drive south on the Spray Lakes road about 9km. Large parking area on the west side of the road.",
