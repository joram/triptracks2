    "description": "A hike starting at the bottom of the Cypress Ski Area in West Vancouver. Start out on Baden-Powell trail heading east. Take the old Mount Strachan trail heading Northwest when you run into that intersection. Follow this trail up to South and North peaks of Mount Strachan. After breaking at the North peak, descend to the saddle between the two peaks and head West down the \"Christmas Gully\" trail until you connect with the Howe Sound Crest Trail and head South to return to the starting point. An optional detour is to the Bowen Island lookout and then continuing to the bottom.",
    "directions": "Just after Highway 1 turns to Highway 99 heading West from Vancouver, take the Cypress Bowl Road exit and and follow the road right up to the ski hill parking lot. The trail starts here.",
