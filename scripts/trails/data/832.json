    "description": "NTS Map:92F11.  This hike starts out as an easy hike on boardwalk, and then becomes a bit rougher.  The trail length is about 14 Kms, taking about 5 hours, with an elevation gain of about 185 meters.  At every junction there is a direction map and  - a you are here - arrow on it.  However, the points between junctions have no indication to help you along, so make sure you stick to the path at all times and when in doubt retrace your steps.  One wrong turn and you could be lost for a while.  You'll be treated to beautiful alpine lakes with some nice views of the distant peaks.",
