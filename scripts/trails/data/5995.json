    "description": "A section of the Trans Canada Trial that runs along the Chilliwack River. Moderate grade - the trial runs along the valley floor. Easy riding on a mountain bike, although there are one or two short sections that are a bit rooty. Can be ridden both ways, so good for an out and back and you can adjust then length of the ride by picking your turn around point. The GPS track is about 8km one way.",
    "directions": "Go through the town of Chilliwack and head up towards Chilliwack lake. \r\rThe most western end of the GPS track is a bit steep, if you want to avoid that steep bit then drive a km or two up the road and join the trial at that point.",
