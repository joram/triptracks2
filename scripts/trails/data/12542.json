    "description": "More or less a walk from the Howard Eaton trailhead (just south of Old Faithful) circling around to Fern Cascade residence for Old Faithful staff.Total of only 70 m ascent each way, it is a lovely walk through open forest and open spaces. Could also be done on snowshoes or back country skies in the winter.You can also do the side trip to the cascade along the creek. Look for the sign, where you turn northwest towards Fern Cascade.",
    "directions": "Approximately 1 km south of Old Faithful exit, on the south side of US Hway 89/191 in Yellowstone National Park, just after the pedestrian crosswalk and rumble strips. Go straight south on the trail, and circle around southwest and then northwest to Fern Cascade. You can walk back to the trailhead along the highway, or circle back for reverse views.",
