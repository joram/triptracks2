    "description": "The Grouse Grind was first developed in 1981 and has become Vancouver?s \rmost popular hike with more than 100 000 hikers yearly.  Summer weekends \rsee a steady stream of people ?Doin the Grind? from when the trail opens till \rclosing.  With an approximate 56 per cent slope (30\u00b0) and very few flat parts \rthis hike is often refereed to as Nature?s StairMaster.  Most view the Grind \ras a workout as there are no viewpoints along the route and it consists of \rmainly stairs, thus it is primary completed for exercise.  However, many \rtourists to Vancouver also feel obligated to make the climb if for nothing \rmore than to say they did it and complain about the hike being to steep and \rcrowded (which are both valid complaints).",
    "directions": "The trail head is at the base of Grouse mountain and is at the end of \rCapilano road in North Vancouver.  There is ample parking near the trail \rhead and buses run all the way to the hikes starting point (if using Google \rmaps find directions to Grouse Mountain Skyride).  To find the trail, look for \rthe Grouse Grind sign just east of the Skyride (If coming up Capilano road \rthe trail head is just left of the Gondola complex).  Look for the notice board, \rclock and water vending machine then go through the gate which locks \rwhen it gets to late to start, normally around 7:00 in the summer.",
