    "description": "Elevation Gain 1370Mtrs.The trail is straight forward until you reach a slight y-intersection (there is an arrow on the ground made of dried wood - thanks to some previous hikers) If you miss this you could end up going the wrong way. From there its straight forward. The views are amazing. There is some hands on scrambling as you near the top. This hike made for an awesome day out. The small alpine meadows along the way are filled with flowers (early July) and you may even be lucky enough to spot some mountain goats, we managed to see three, very cool :)",
    "directions": "Head west on HWY 1 from Banff and turnoff at 1A. The trail head is 1.9km from the turnoff. Small parking area is right at the beginning of the trail. This is not the same trail as Cory Pass but slightly further down the highway.",
