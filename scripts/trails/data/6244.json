    "description": "Roche Miette is a very prominent peak just inside the east gate of Jasper National Park. The North Face is sheer, but as a scramble the summit can be gained from the northeast. \r\rFrom the trail head cross the gate, from the back right side of the parking lot the approach trail is visible. The approach is an overgrown road to the left that parallels the road, running northeast. Follow the trail for approximatly 10 min, passing a cairn, as well as some orange marking pickets. The second cairn, with log's laid parallel to the trail, indicates the trail head.  \r\rThe path begins in a forest and gains little elevation until after crossing a drainage. Following the drainage the path begins to gain elevation quickly, to gain the ridge. As you gain the saddle veer left for an obvious gully, marking tape an the occasional cairn mark the route through the talus/scree field. \r\rThe summit of Roch Miette is gained by traversing the plateau like top, however more people are interested in the sheer drop of the north face, which is past the summit.\r\r",
    "directions": "The trailhead is on the east side of highway 16, opposite a pipeline, 3.5km southwest of Pocahontas/Miette hot springs road. There is a small parking lot.",
