    "description": "The 5.1km Fiddle-Mystery Connector in Jasper National Park joins the  Fiddle River Trailto the  Mystery Lake Trail. It is completely lacking in scenery and is prime grizzly habitat. Yet combined with the other trails it makes a loop trip in the Fiddle River Valley a possibility.The trail starts between the Fiddle warden cabin and the outhouse. After a short distance the trail to  High Pass branches right, keep left. Crossing a low forested divide the trail connects with the Mystery Lake trail at 7.5km. For a virtually unknown trail I was surprised that it was recently cleared of deadfall.Submitted by 'mtncat'.",
