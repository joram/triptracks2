    "description": "A nice trail with only ~250m or so of cumulative elevation, the North Bragg trail is another trail winding though the trees and hills West of Bragg Creek.  Close to Calgary, it makes a nice trip if you're looking for a 1/2 day outing or a place to take your time.  You can shorten it up a bit by not walking around the optional loop you can see in the NW corner of the map.\nIf you're walking it counter-clockwise, in the NE corner of the parking lot you will see SnowShoe Hare trail and /or Hostel Loop, you start off going up this trail and bear (bad choice of words.. STAY) to the left / north-ish to get to the North Bragg Creek trail.\nThis trail winds through the hills on the inside of the much longer Telephone Trail.  The other end (or start if you're walking it clockwise) is back in on the end of Telephone trail which you then use the road or Moose Connector over to Crystal Line.\nThe possibilites are endless, just get out there and wander around.  I do wonder why this trail doesn't make the maps of the area, trust me it is there.  There are a number of other trails all in this area so you can take any of them and/or mix 'n match them.",
    "directions": "West of Calgary to Bragg Creek (17km S of Hiway 1 on Hiway 22), go into Bragg Creek, past the 2 small strip malls, and find the bridge in front of the T interesction with a stop sign. Turn left and go 9km to West Bragg parking lot (at gated end of road). Trail starts at the NE corner of the parking lot.",
