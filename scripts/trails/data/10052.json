    "description": "Excellent trail. Steep start up to a nice ridge. This can be connected to Viking Ridge for a loop trip. \r\rThis trail is an excellent transition from interior rain forest. Lots of cedar. It continues up into subalpine and then into full alpine. There are only a couple months of the year where this trail is completely snow free.",
    "directions": "Travel highway 16 west from Prince George past the Purden Ski Hill. The boundary to the Sugarnbowl-Grizzly Den park is mark on the side of the highway. Several hundred meters after the park sign, there is a parking lot on the right (south) side of the highway with a sign and parking. \r\rThe trail head is clearly marked out of the parking lot.",
