    "description": "Northern half of the 60 km-long Coastal Trail along the northeast shore of Lake Superior, from Hattie's Cove south to Oiseau Bay and back. Rough in many places, and often requires pushing through fairly thick bush. A fair number of fallen trees on trail (maybe one per hour), which are easily bypassed. Rocky sections marked only by cairns; not always well marked. Some boulder fields which are hard on the ankles and knees. Quite slippery when wet. Insects are bad. Campsites are pretty but primitive.It's a popular area for sea-kayakers as well!",
    "directions": "Fly to Thunder Bay, take Highway 11 about 300 km, about 20-30 km past Marathon. You could also take a Greyhound bus from Thunderbay to Marathon and then catch a cab from there into the park (possible, too, that you could get the bus to let you off at the turn-off to the park and then hike maybe 8 km to the trailhead).",
