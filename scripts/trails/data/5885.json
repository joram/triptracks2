    "description": "Very steep with little let up.  Trail is rough only go if you want to challenge your resolve.",
    "directions": "Drive Interstate 90 and get off on Exit 34 (Edgewick Road), turn left, pass the Seattle East Auto Truck Plaza and turn right on Middle Fork Road. The road splits at the end of the pavement and rejoins at Valley Camp (2.1 miles from the turn onto the Middle Fork) -- it doesn't really matter which road you take. Three-tenths of a mile further look for three roads off to your right. The middle road (gated) is the beginning of the hike. You'll find plenty of room to park.",
