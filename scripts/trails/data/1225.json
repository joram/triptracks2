    "description": "NTS Map:92F12.  A short trail (20 minutes) take a long Ralph river for a while before it loops back through the woods.  Nice big trees and a nice walk a long the river.  Worth a stop if you are in the area. Combine with some of the other shorter trails.",
    "directions": "Take the Island highway north to Campbell River, hang a left onto highway 28.  Then take Westmin Road south to Wild Ginger parking lot. About 1.5 hours from Courtenay.",
