    "description": "This trail is one of the easier ways to reach the summit of Cadillac Mountain. The trail head can be found just off of a small parking area on the Park Loop road. It provides a gradual ascent to the summit. There are severl points  to step out and enjoy the view as you make your ascent. Once above the tree line, the trail skirts the auto road to the summit and consists of mainly exposed rock. Once on the top you can enjoy the great view of Bar Harbor and the surrounding Islands. You can take the trail back down or try the Gorge Path if you want a more challenging trail.",
    "directions": "From Bar Harbor you can take either route 3 or 233 to the Park Loop Road. You will find the entrance to the trail a short ways down from where the loop road turns into one way traffic.",
