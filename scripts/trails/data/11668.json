    "description": "A different spin to a old trail. If you are tired of the traditional routes to the top try this one. It adds about 30 extra minutes, but it allows you to escape the forest canopy that covers most of the traditional route and walk about an hour along a largely open ridge.",
    "directions": "Start from traditional trailhead at Witchcraft Lake. Hike one of the trails until you hit the old logging road at about 700 metres. Turn right and proceed straight along logging road. Avoid two left turnings - keep continuing straight. Turn left at third turning. Proceed down old road and keep right. Pass the new park boundary sign. Logging road eventually peters out, but the trail continues. This is not a major trail so keep your wits about you. If you are not sure of the trail go back to where you last were sure of the trail and proceed from there. Trail continues and goes slight left until it debouches on to the open ridge. Follow the ridge to the top following cairns. Some places the trail is a little thin, but you cannot get lost as long as you follow the ridge. Eventually this route joins the major main trail just below the summit block. Note: Trail is not major, it is hard to follow in places. Use you good sense of geography and map/ compass/GPS if unsure. Cairns mark the route, but in places there is trail trace lacking.",
