    "description": "Moderate to difficult depending on choice of trail-utilizes old logging road for easy access or trail for more adventure. The main feature of this trail is the end! The lookout over the Madawaska Highlands is breathtaking. If you time your hike well you will spot Turkey vultures or Eagles soaring out over the 300 to 400 ft cliff band. The trail keepers have tied into the local native community and have incorparated signage explaining the significance of the area. A local artist has built a huge wood sign with local folklore.",
    "directions": "From Ottawa-west hwy 417 to Arnprior--continue to hwy 508-turn left through town of Burnstown, through town of Calabogie, past Calabogie Peaks Ski resort. 3 km up on the left keep an eye out for small trail marker with small parking area on right.",
