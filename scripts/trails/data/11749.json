    "description": "This is a short hike you can tack on after you are done with the Crow?s Nest hike close by.  This is a hike along the Pennant River to a series of small falls and rapids.  There are seldom any waterfalls on the South shore and these ones are as high as they get.  The trail is unofficial but sees a lot of traffic as it is well defines.  There are large boulders everywhere to explore.",
    "directions": "In Sambro, drive towards West Pennant on highway 349 and park by the bridge over Pennant River .",
