    "description": "This beautiful water fall trail is located about 21 km from the centre of Marysville, BC, just down the hill from Kimberley.  The trail is about 1.4 km in length and descends about 120 m downhill from the trailhead, past a small abandoned gold mine (with artifacts!) to a pretty series of pools below a stunning waterfall.  The trail is short, easy to follow, interesting and rewards with the waterfall.  The trailhead has parking for several vehicles,",
    "directions": "Proceed south of Marysville about 7km along Hwy 95A to the Wycliffe Park rd. and turn right. Proceed about 2km then turn right on the Old Wycliffe Rd.  Proceed about 1 km then turn right on the Perry Ck Rd.  Follow this road for about 10 km.  The trailhead will be on your left.**NOTE**  This is a busy industrial resource road. Proceed with caution, turn your headlights on and be prepared for large industrial vehicles coming your way.  This road can be very dusty in summer",
