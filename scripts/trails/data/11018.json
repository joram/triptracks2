    "description": "For those who want to know baleine = whale.  This was my very first hike in Nova Scotia.  As a recent transplant to Sydney in 1999, I set off to explore my surroundings.   What a pleasant surprise this turned out to be.  The Baleine hike is all on the water's edge on one side and it's got expansive barrens on the other.  There are so many place to explore during this hike.   There is a natural bridge actively being carved out by the sea, lobster traps parts strewn everywhere, and immense solitude.  You can do the whole loop kind of thing and  take the highway back yo your car, or, explore only the waterfront and retrace your steps back to the car.  Either way this hike is a good half day or as long as you choose if you do not have enough time.  There are no houses anywhere on this hike which makes you believe you are deep in the wilderness but really it's only 25 min from Sydney.",
    "directions": "Louisbourg highway to the Louisbourg-Main a Dieu Rd.  Turn on this rd and  continue until you see signs pointing to Baleine. Park at the end of Baleine Rd and begin hiking.",
