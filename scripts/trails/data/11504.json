    "description": "This is a serious scramble, technically really challenging and physically exhausting. Experienced scramblers only for sure to do the complete traverse, as you will need someone who has excellent abilities for route finding and hands on scrambling. Refer to Alan Kane's book for some details. Exposure can be extreme with very thin paths at least 3 or 4 times on the ridge. Kane's book suggest to do it North to South, we did the opposite and it was fine.Max elevation 2590 m, gain for 1223 m with elevation loss very often10-12 hours trip.",
    "directions": "Take Highway 40 to Kananaskis. You need 2 cars, one to park at 35 km from Highway 1 and along Highway 40. You'll see a cairn on the left side of the  road, it's close to Eau Claire Campground. Then, you go to the Fortress Junction Service Station and start from there.",
