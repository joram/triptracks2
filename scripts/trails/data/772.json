    "description": "The trail is easy at the beginning.  You will need some flip-flops to cross a river or two.  It takes about 3.5 hours to get to the glacier/camp.  It is best to attempt the glacier when it is its coldest, 1:00 am.  Navigating the glacier during summer months can be tricky, as some snow bridges may be out.\nNote, be prepared as winds can be strong and cold.  Bring crampons and ice axe.\n There is GPS data attached to this trail (see \"download GPS\"), which if loaded into your GPS can help you find route points.",
    "directions": "The trail is easy to find.  Follow the signs to Mt. Baker.  Once in the town of Glacier, buy your ?pass?.  There is an information center just before the turn off.",
