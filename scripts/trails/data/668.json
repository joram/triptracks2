    "description": "NTS Map: 092F01\r\nTons of trails with a good variety of DH/Freeride trails and cross country. The good DH/Freeride trails are on the left of the road you come up, and the better cross country trails are on the right side (the side with the motor-cross track). Lots of jumps, ramp and log rides, some ramps up to over 100 feet long and 10+ feet in the air, drops up to 10-15 feet and lots of smaller ones too. You just have to explore all of the trails to find it all. Here is a list of trails with ramps, jumps, and/or drops to look for on this site or search on Yahoo.  Bubbles in the tub, Armageddon (upper and lower), Y2K, Flow Show, Old Car, Cripple Creek, Monkeys in the Mist. \r\n\r\nAlso check out more advanced trails like Y2K.",
    "directions": "Find the Nanaimo Parkway, (the Vancouver Island Highway).  Between Woodgrove Mall and Northfield Road is a road called Jinglepot Rd. Turn onto it off the highway and take the first right to Biggs Rd. Down this road there will be a jail and a lake on your right a little ways ahead. Follow this road, and later on your right, will be a gravel pit and Duomont Rd. Go past and keep heading up till you get to the motor-cross track, which is on your right. Park here and look on your map. Always ride hard, fast, and big. Enjoy!!",
