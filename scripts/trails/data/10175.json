    "description": "From the Morony Dam parking area it's walk through grasslands bordering the  Missouri River to a small sulphur springs pond the natives claimed to have some medicinal properties.\nViews of open range territory in Montana and the Morony Dam.  My grandfather was a Montana range rider in the 1870's and 1880's so I kept expecting to see his ghost come riding over the hills.\nThis is rattlesnake country so beware (we didn't see any this time).",
    "directions": "From Great Falls take Highway 87 towards Harve, turn east (right) on Morony Dam road (the sign may also point to Ryan Dam). Follow Morony Dam road to the parking lot with the red house. Trail head is there and marked with a sign.",
