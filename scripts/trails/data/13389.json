    "description": "The hike takes you through fields of huckleberries, where you can stop and snack in summer...then winds its way above tree line for a brief time...enjoy the views here!  Then, you can follow the sign for Six-Mountain, or turn right (South) to go to Hall Lake.\n\nThe path to Hall Lake will take you through pretty flowered meadows, but stay vigilant in following the path as it is overgrown with leafy plants.  You will descend to the lake, and it seems to take forever, as you can see it from a long way off.\n\nTake some time off at the lake to \"water\" your dog, or dunk your tootsies in to cool off.  Another 5kms after that, to get to the destination point,",
    "directions": "Drive on Highway 83 towards Swan Lake...once at Swan Lake...drive about 9kms to where you see a State Park sign for Six-Mile Mountain...there is a sharp right hand turn there.  Drive on this road for 4kms and the Trailhead sign is on your right.\n\nI would recommend that you leave another car at the end point, located off of Fenby Lane (located right alongside an Inn) on Highway 83.  The State Park parking lot is located less that 2kms along Fenby Lane.",
