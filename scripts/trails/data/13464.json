    "description": "I have hiked a lot in the Cobequids and this was a nice surprise.  A pair of unknown falls.  The journey is first on a recently logged area (2020) and then continues on a well defined ATV path.  Once you reach the brook, go upstream for about 200m to a three tier fall of about 20ft.  afterward go downstream for 700m or so to the tallest fa;ll.  Here is a nice hemlock ravine with a two tier fall of about 25 ft.  a nice slider type fall is the upper portion.  You will notice that my route then follows another tributary towards my starting point but no falls were to be found on that brook.",
    "directions": "North of Bass river.  Take the New Castleraegh Road and park at a recently logged area and road at;  N45.45584\u00b0 W63.76049\u00b0",
