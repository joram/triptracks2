    "description": "Another great little exploration in the middle of nowhere Nova Scotia.  I have visited these falls a while ago but forgot to post it.  Devils Hook falls are located on the North river which flows into the Lahave River north of New Germany\u2026There are so many north rivers in Nova Scotia\u2026not sure why they couldn\u2019t come up with more variety in the names.  North river also have some great falls downstream called Apron Falls (in trailpeak and my waterfall guide).   There are more named falls on this river\u2026one of which is called Whalesback Fall.  I bushwacked to those to find a 1 ft rapid\u2026\u2026again sometimes what is described on maps is not the reality!\n\nI call this a little exploration as the falls are located only 200m from a gravel road.  Depending on the shape of the road and you car clearance you could be hiking a lot more.  The falls are very nice and unexpected in this part of the province which is a bonus. From recent satellite imagery it seems there is another fall about 300m more downstream\u2026please let me know if you ever explore it",
