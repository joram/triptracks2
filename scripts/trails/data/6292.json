    "description": "Tom, Jenn, and I's traverse of the Garibaldi Neve in spring 2009.\r\rFrom the Elfin Lakes Trailhead follow the markers to Elfin Lakes hut.  We did this portion at night and had no trouble with route finding.\r\rFrom the Elfin Lakes Hut drop down towards Ring Creek.  There are two gullies to cross which can be difficult.  After passing the Gargoyles follow Ring Creek up onto the Neve.  Cross a big snow field and head up and right to cross the Pitt Glaciers.  After the high point head towards a rock wall South of the Sharks Fin.  There are big open crevasses here so use caution.  After this it's a glorious descent down below the Sharks Fin and down the Sentinel Glacier to Garibaldi Lake.  We stayed at Sphinx Hut.",
    "directions": "From Squamish follow the signs to the Elfin Lakes trailhead.  Finishing point is the Rubble Creek trailhead.",
