    "description": "From Surprise Corner Viewpoint parking lot, take Hoodoos Viewpoint trail. The trail is approximately 5km to the Tunnel Mountain campground - one way.  It is a very easy trail, ok for old timers and baby carriages.  A beautiful walk that follows the River and passes some amazing rock formations called the Hoodoos -these are further down the trail near the campground.  Because it is spectacular, easy, and right in Banff, the trail becomes very busy on weekends in the summer.  My bf and I took his mum and pop out for a breakfast at the Hoodoos.  We went about 8 and there was only a couple other people there on the trail.  A must for any visitor to Banff.",
