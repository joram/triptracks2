    "description": "A good trail up onto a granite ridge in Killarney Provincial Park, part of the La Cloche long distance path.  The trail runs through the trees and skirts several lakes before climbing sharply through The Crack onto the large granite ridge running through Killarney Park.\nThe trail can be started from the George Lake campground or from a small car park closer to The Crack.  If starting from George Lake add another couple of hours to the walk time.  Most of the walking is easy on undulating ground through trees.  This section can also be a bit boggy as well.  The final section requires a bit of scrambling through The Crack itself onto the ridge.  Worth it for the wonderful views from the top, a great place to have lunch.",
    "directions": "From Sudbury take Highway 69 South towards Toronto.  After about 40 mins turn right onto the 637 to Killarney.    Follow this road all the way into the Provincial Park (it seems to take forever, it's a long road).  Stop at the George Lake Park Info Centre, and get your day pass.  You can start the walk from there (add a couple of hours), or re-trace your steps back towards Sudbury on the 637 and park in the car park on the left up above the road.  This car park is about 5 or 6km from the Info Centre, and is very small, but there is just room for cars on the shoulder of the road.",
