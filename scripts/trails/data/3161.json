    "description": "Elevation gain:860m. This is a short and popular trail giving access to the alpine and great views over the valley. This trail is actually an old mining access road which is a bit overgrown in places. You will see some old mining ruins near a creek and a bench on your right after 2km. As the road comes out at treeline it becomes more of a trail to the ridges of Harvey Mountain. The summit area is rather flat and allows further walking along ridges to get down the other side to lakes and marshy meadows which can connect you with the McCabe trail.",
    "directions": "Take hwy 16 east of Smithers just over the Bulkley river bridge and turn left on Old Babine Lake Rd. Turn left at the junction with the Telkwa High Road. Turn right at Driftwood Road and continue 10 km to the parking area (6k past Driftwood Canyon Park keeping right at Park Rd). There is a small parking spot here after crossing 2 bridges, and the trail sign is on your right.",
