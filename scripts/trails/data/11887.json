    "description": "A second loop that intersects the dobson trail. I'm not sure of its proper name but it follows the Mill Creek closely, and used frequently by dog owners.",
    "directions": "from riverview take 114 to the Gunningsville Road, then a Left on pine glenn. Its just a short trip past the bridge. There are two parking lots, both have signage for the dobson trail. Take the Dobson trail about 1.5km and after the second clearing there is a path to the right, take it instead of the main path.",
