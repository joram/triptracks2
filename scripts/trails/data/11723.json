    "description": "You set off on the St Margarets Bay rail to trails for about 200m to a small to medium size stream coming off the moutain on your right.  There are a couple of smaller falls on this brook as you first follow it on a faint trail and then it's pure bushwack to see the other ones.  I set off in this partcular spot because there is a long distance running event done close by.  It's called the Cuddly Coyote and it offers either a 13 or 25.8km run.  On the west side of the brook I followed the ATV trail which is part of the running route.  you can find more infomation here;  https://www.facebook.com/pages/Nova-Scotia-Trail-Running/317735341692496",
