    "description": "This is not a long hike but I noticed that there is not of hikes in this part of the province.  This hike will take you to a series of waterfalls on Davidson Brook.  Actually they are more like small sliders than true falls.  The geology of the rock prevent the formation of the spectacular falls found in the Cobequid mountains.  However the forest near the brook is stunning with large evergreen providing a level of shade so large that the moss feels like a deep lush carpet underfoot.  The fall near the power lines would be the largest and longest that I saw on the brook and it appears it is sometimes used as a swimming hole by locals.",
    "directions": "In oxford, take the Wyvern Rd heading towards Parrsboro.  Turn right on Wyndham Hill Rd and park at the power lines.  Head down the powerline trail to the brook and hike upstream.",
