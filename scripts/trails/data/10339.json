    "description": "This short hike through the woods takes you to a waterfall and small cave located on the Harrington River near Five Islands.\r\rThe start of the hike is on a short logging road of about 150m.  You then enter a mixed forest that is in transition.  There are a lot of small deciduous trees that are about 6-7ft tall and these will definitely slow you down.  Luckily the river is only about 600m from the road.  You eventually come out to the side of a gully.  Carefully make your way down the steep slope and then downstream to a two-tier waterfall with a drop of elevation of about 30ft in total.  Downstream of the falls, there are some large stone cliffs on the eastern side of the river.  Up 20ft from the rivers edge, is a small cave of about 6ft.  The type of rock in this area makes me believe that the water from the river was once the cause of the carving of this cave on the rock wall.\r\r",
