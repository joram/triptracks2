    "description": "This lovely trail climbs steadily up into alpine tundra and ends on a narrow ridge. Amazing views especially above Marion Lake. Highly exposed beyond the end of the trail.During the early season take the marked short cut to avoid a steep snow slope, but later in the season, this longer route makes for a spectacular loop trip.",
    "directions": "The trail starts at the Illecillewaet Campground in Rogers Pass.",
