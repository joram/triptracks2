    "description": "Very nice hike with a tremendous 360\u00b0 view on top. The 3km run trough dense forest before reaching subalpine and eventually alpine. Once you reach the alpine one generally aims for the summit, there is  no real trail anymore. While the rest of the way (trail) is fairly obvious, in winter, it can be hard to find the exact route and GPS would be required to reach the alpine proper.",
    "directions": "Park at the Maligne Canyon parking behind the restaurant and hike back to Maligne Lake rd. Follow the road for +/- 300m untill you see a small stonecarn on your left side with a little trail leading into the forest. Once you are 200m in the forest, the trail becomes very obvious",
