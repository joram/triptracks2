    "description": "This 18km hike takes the Ammonoosuc trail, Crawford Path to the summit then back down by Gulfside and Jewel trail. The trail starts near the Cog Railway and returns just down from the station. This is a fairly easy trail in fine weather, but can become fairly dangerous in bad. There is a good hike above tree line. On the day we went we got everything from sun rain hail thunder and high winds. Please back your bag accordingly.",
    "directions": "From Bretton Woods town follow the Base road to the Cog Railway to the summit. There is a parking fee of $5. The Ammonoosuc trail starts just to the right and past the train depot/restaurant.",
