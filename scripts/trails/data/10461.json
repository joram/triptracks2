    "description": "The Lantzville Foothills are a handful of beautiful rocky knolls rising above a clearcut area that is slated for subdivision. Some people worry that these viewpoints will soon be available only from other peoples' living room windows. However, the (various) developers have promised to reserve the peaks of the hills as parkland for use by the future residents. \r\rYou can spend some time in this system of old logging roads and bluffs. A 7km hike is possible, or you could do a shorter 4km loop, if you can find your way around.\r",
    "directions": "From the Island Highway north of town, turn west onto Ware Road (the second light past Woodgrove Centre). Turn left onto Harwood Dr.  At the dead-end is a parking area on the right.  Walk across the bridge and you're at the start of the trail.",
