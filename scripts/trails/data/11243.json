    "description": "This is an easy hike through a magnificent valley near Middle River, Cape Breton Island.  The whole trail is set on an old mining and logging road which hugs the side of the valley.  There are numerous puddles and one area where the road has slide down the ravine.  Lots of pieces of quartz everywhere.  This area had some intense gold mining operations a while ago.  If you pursue the hike you will end u at an area where there are some old gold mine adits to explore.  The forest in the whole valley is an Acadian mature hardwoods and I am sure must be spectacular in the fall.  We ended up driving part of the whole road to where a bridge was washed ou but next time \u00c9I would park where the old wood roads begin.  It would add a few km but would be easier than driving it.",
    "directions": "Cabot trail to Middle River.  Turn on Gold Brook Rd and park at its conclusion and start walking on the old dirt road...enjoy!",
