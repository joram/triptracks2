    "description": "Hummingbird Plume Lookout is an easy firelook out hike. The lookout was probably constructed around 1915 and has been abandoned for a long time. It was used by POW's in the area during WW II, while they were gather wood from the fire of 1936. \r\rThe lookout itself is completely surrounded by trees now and has no view but just few meters further along the trail there is an overlook with fantastic views to the east of the Kananaskis Valley.\r\rThere are a number of ways to access the trail, finding a trail sign which shows a route to the Sunburst trail is the easiest.\r\rMostly this is a walk, ride or ski in the forest. Trails are marked for X country skiers.",
    "directions": "Length of trail depends where you start one option is north end of Nakiska parking area. Another which we chose was the powerline access parking just off the road to Kananaskis village just after the turn off Highway 40.\r\rFollowing any of the trails in the area to the Sunburst trail viewpoint will get to the lookout.\r\rFrom the powerline parking trail was just over 6km with 400 meters of elevation.",
