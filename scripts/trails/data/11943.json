    "description": "On the outskirts of Kentville, off the south mountains, lies a public-private path.  This path runs along the Gaspereau Canal.  This canal is used by NS Power.  The first part of the trail is a woods road but after crossing a small brook you can spot a small trail on your left. Take it to the dam and then continue along the water's edge towards your left.   You will come up to a physical barrier in the lake and not much further the cana begins.  The trail on the portion of the canal is super flat so bring your bike!  I was lucky and stumbled on a large turtle on the dam!",
    "directions": "Highway 12 to a gated road where there is a sign for the \"town\" of Forest Home.",
