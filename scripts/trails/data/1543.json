    "description": "First left to clearing.\rPleasant forest going uphill, ignoring a track at the 2.5 km mark.\rViewpoint at 3.5 km mark.\rContinue west along trail, drop down slightly until you hit a little pond, and then head uphill the rest of the way.\rLog ladders are near the top, and you can ease your way onto the summit.",
    "directions": "Travelling east on Highway 1, take Exit 119A ( Sardis ), drive through Sardis to the Vedder Crossing Bridge, where you turn left.  Just after the sign for Cultus Lake Provincial Park you go right on a wide gravel road, Paramter Road.  After 600m go right on Vedder Mountain Forest Service Road, then after another 600m go left on its southeastern fork.  Stay on this uphill road for 3km to the trailhead signpost.  From the signpost walk up the broken road and take the first left 200m to a clearing.",
