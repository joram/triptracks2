    "description": "Hiked up, biked down. Mt. Elbert is not in protected wilderness area, which means that bikes are a go. Riding up would be doable on a more XC oriented bike and twice our endurance, but we brought our beefy full suspensions rigs to really enjoy the descent. If I were to do this again I would camp at the trailhead and start, instead of leaving the front range at 3am like we did.",
