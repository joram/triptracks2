    "description": "This challenging multi day high alpine ridge traverse is destined to be a Kootenay Classic.Facilitated by Mount Carlyle Backcountry Lodge, this is a 4 day 3 night ?Glamping? trip where all you need to carry is a day pack. They have 2 fully supplied campsites in the alpine, and a very comfortable lodge for a 3rd night. There may be another campsite available for a 4th night, if you wish to extend the ridge walk.We actually called our trip ?A Taste of the Sourdough? as we only did parts of it. Owner, Brian Cross, was very helpful in tailoring our trip to our particular needs.",
    "directions": "The traverse starts on Idaho Peak near New Denver. Check out their website for details:http://www.skihikebc.com/summer/",
