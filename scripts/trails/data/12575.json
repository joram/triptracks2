    "description": "Round Head, as it is locally known, is coastal trail offering more beautiful panoramic views, Bell Isle and Labrador in the distance. The trail is Very gentle until the end, where one makes a steep ascent at a set of stairs, or if preferred, the back of the hill where you can also enter a Sea Cave.When you arrive at the top you are offered panoramic views of L'Anse aux Meadows National Historic Site and the surrounding area. You can return via the same route you accessed initially or through the viking village of Norstead, where Viking re-enactments occur. yo may be asked to pay for your visit if you come this way.Reutirning approximately the same rout you started is about 3.6km. If you choose to go through Nortstead and back on the highway, it is 4.2km.Enjoy!",
    "directions": "Drive toward L'Anse Au Meadows, Pul over where the road offers parking on your left. Head down toward the coast on your right. A set of stairs is at the trailhead.",
