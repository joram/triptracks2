    "description": "Something to do while spending an evening in St. Barbe waiting for the ferry.  Several entrances to the walking trails, they are clearly marked.  A longer loop (4km) may be created by doing the boardwalk at the pond, hidden in the trees, then walking the seashore and visiting the old family cemetaries, it's interesting to see the family history (e.g. Applins).  Heritage and history run strong here.  There is an obserbvation deck looking out over the ocean, and a curious child's park with miniature play homes.",
    "directions": "Just leave the dockside motel, driving to the right and up through a new development (street) and past the fish plant in town (St. Barbe) then continue on a few hundred meters, you'll see the signs for the walking trails.",
