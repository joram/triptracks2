    "description": "The Amasa Back Trail follows the Cliff Hanger 4x4 road. This is a somewhat technical bike trail; mostly on dirt and slick rock; steep climbs and loose rock.While the majority of this trail follows a jeep trail there are some single track sections. Be prepared to wait on and pass jeeps in the more technical areas.",
    "directions": "Head out of Moab on Kane Creek Blvd. Head south 6.5 km from where the road swings south and starts to follow the river. The trail head is well marked.",
