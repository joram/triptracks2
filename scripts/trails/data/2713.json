    "description": "Mt. Adams (12 276') via south ridge.  Can be done as a day trip from Cold Springs campground (despite the name there's no water so be forwarned) or as an overnighter with a stop at the Lunch Counter camp sites at ~ 9 000'.  Excellent spring skiing; superb views and easy, non-technical climbing make it a \"must do\".  I've climbed in in June and August and preferred the former as it provides more route flexibility with the snow.\r\n\r",
    "directions": "Getting there is easy.  Take the I5 south to the Columbia River; hwy 14 to hwy 141; north to the small town of Trout Lake where you need to pick up climbing permits/water; then, follow the signs for the foresst road to the Cold Springs trailhead.",
