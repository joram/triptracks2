    "description": "This is a lovely hike to a remote mountain lake about 900m in elevation. This means the trees here are all high elevation species. The mountain views are spectacular and the fishing is supposed to be pretty good. The day we made the track was a warm August long weekend Monday and there were around 20 people scattered around the lake. That's more than I've ever seen there before. This year the landscape has changed quite a bit as the land owner near the lake has done quite a bit of logging quite near the trail.  It's still a great day hike.",
    "directions": "To get to the trailhead drive west from Cathedral Grove (Macmillan Provincial Park) about 8 km to a forest road that crosses the highway. From there turn on Your GPS and be guided.",
