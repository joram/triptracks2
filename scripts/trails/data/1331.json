    "description": "While most visitors to Banff National Park stop to visit Johnston Canyon and it's spectacular waterfalls a lot less venture further up the trail to the Ink Pots and the vast upper valley of Johnston Creek - and that is a shame as the area holds some magnificent views of the inner sights of Banff Park.There are two trailheads to reach the inkpots and while a loop is possible if two cars are used it is some 4km from one trailhead to the other.Starting from the tourist busy Johnston Canyon trailhead take in the sights of first the lower falls and then the upper falls - the trail them steepens and climbs up to a junction with a trail coming up from Moose Meadows - this is used by horses and those heading into the back country that don't want the crowds of the main trail - you will continue to climb on the trail and then drop down steeply to the Ink Pots - a series of some eight small ponds - there is a rest area and this will be the turn around point for day hikers - while the valley beyond is goregous it is a fair slog to venture much further in a day.The Johnston Creek trail heads  deep into the back country of Banff Park and is beyond the scope of this report.NTS Map: 082O04Elevation Gain: 243 m (797 ft).",
    "directions": "Take Highway 1A - Bow Valley Parkway to the Johnston Canyon trailhead - and follows the trail to the inkpots - alternately - park at the Moose Meadows parking area some 4km west of Johnston Canyon trailhead and follow the trail and signposts to the Inkpots - if you have previously visited the falls or don't want crowds take this trail.",
