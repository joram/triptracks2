    "description": "This is definitely one of Glacier National Park's classic trail hikes.In between Dawson and Pitamakin passes, the trail clings to the edge of steep scree slopes and cliff ledges with some really great views along the way. Far off to the west, Mt. Stimson looks quite foreboding; other cool mountain views in the area include Sinopah to the south and Pumpelly glacier on Blackfoot/Walton mountains to the north. The loop actually circumnavigates three peaks (Rising Wolf, Flinsch Peak and Mt. Morgan).We caught the 9 AM ferry and hiked over Dawson Pass and went all the way to Pitamakin Pass. Instead of completing the loop by dropping down from Pitamakin and following the forested valley trail back to Two Medicine Lake for approximately 10 km, we returned the way we came and caught the 5:15 ferry back to the campground.",
    "directions": "The proper trailhead starts at Two Medicine Lake campground. Catching the tourboat ($11.25 USD return trip) cuts down about 6 km of hiking along the lake either at the beginning or the end of the day... I would suggest grabbing the boat in the morning so you don't have to stress about trying to catch the last ferry.",
