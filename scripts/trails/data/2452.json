    "description": "Nice, *easy* abandoned rail ROW (Right Of Way) along some fabulously scenic mountain ledges, with a few old trestles crossing creeks and falls.  Some (all?) of the trestles have been built with fantastic workpersonship to be 100% safe and comfy for all to cross.\r\n\r\nFrom Mountain Station lot, you have your choice of East & Down or West & Up.\r\n\r\nIf you take the downhill first directions, about 8km takes you to he end of the road where this ROW joins up with some live tracks.  1.73% grade average over the first 5 km can be ridden by anyone.\r\n\r\nAlso, the Mnt. Stn. parking lot is the center of a huge assortment of some serious looking d/h.  Bring yer armour.\r",
    "directions": "Drive UP from downtown Nelson, Cedar Street is good, so are others.  Turn left (East) on Gore Street (Gore as in what won't happen to you on this trail).  The Mountain Station parking lot is at the corner of Gore & Cherry Streets.  There is one other lot more to the east off Elwin / 11 Street.",
