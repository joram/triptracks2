    "description": "A steep, long scree slope on unmarked trail. You can follow the markings on the rock outcrops, or pick your own way. It is steep and expect a lot of movement underfoot. You can reserve an overnight spot in the Abbott Hut through the Alpine Club of Canada (recommended) or come back down same day. Going over the pass to Lake Louise is no longer allowed.\nGood climbing from the Hut on Victoria and Lefroy. Listen to (and watch for!) falling rocks from above. Amazing views from the top, obviously, which is a great reward. Outhouse at the back of the Hut is a luxury.\nComing down can be more difficult than the ascent. Large boulder fields sometimes replace scree slopes. \nBe prepared for strong winds, and helmets are definitely a must.",
    "directions": "Follow any well marked trail to Lake Oesa from Lake O'Hara (variety of trails there) and then head up, up, up the big scree slope between Mts Victoria (on your left) and Lefroy (on your right).",
