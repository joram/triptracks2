    "description": "I elected to reference the trails dedicated website instead of re-writing. Please follow the attached links for full information.\"While it will be years before the entire trail is complete, a large portion is ready to ride, run, hike, ski and snowshoe. The Sea to Sky Trail is an ambitious project through a challenging landscape. It will take years to complete but a lot of new trail has been built throughout the region and the rest currently exists in an unimproved (and often un-signed) condition. While most of the 180 km route exists away from traffic, where no trail yet exists the default route is along the highway or local roads. Check out the following ready to ride sections and plan your adventure today!\" - http://www.seatoskytrail.ca/ready-to-ridehttp://www.seatoskytrail.ca/http://www.seatoskytrail.ca/maps",
