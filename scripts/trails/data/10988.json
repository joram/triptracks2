    "description": "The Chester Lake (above) Snowshoe Trail is well marked. Both the trailhead and waypoint #002 is on the Chester Lake hiking trail. The snowshoe trail leaves this path at waypoint #003. The snowshoe trail is marked with little florescent signs with snowshoe prints on them. This trail is very popular. For the most part when hiking this winter in Kananaskis I probably never saw more than 5 or 6 people on any given trail. On this trail I probably saw at least 20 people.",
    "directions": "Drive west of Calgary on Highway #1 approximately 60 kilometres. Turn south on highway #40 and drive 50 kilometres. At the intersection of highway #40 and Kananaskis Lakes Trail turn right (west) onto Kananaskis Lakes Trail and drive approximately 2.3 kilometres and turn right again onto  highway #742 (the Smith-Dorrien/Spray Trail). Drive 18 kilometres to the Chester Lake Parking Lot. The other option is to leave from Canmore and drive south on Highway #742 approximately 45 kilometres to the Chester Lake Parking Lot.",
