    "description": "After a few years of exploration for waterfalls in Nova Scotia, I seldom receive any tips on new ones...until I received one of a fall on the Nine Mile river near Elmsdale.That was surprising as the river is mostly sluggish as it drains large areas of mostly flat topography.  The time was for a section of the river most easily accessed via canoe or using the logging roads that lead to the old Rnfrew gold mines.The road are in good shape and I was left with about 600m of bushwhack to access the river.  The bushwack was easy as it was winter but it may be more difficult once all the foliage are up as the area has been recently logged.The river here does not really have a fall but more of a cascade type settings where it looses about 10ft of elevation.  this is probably be a good spot to camp or go for a swim in relative privacy.",
