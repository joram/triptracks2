    "description": "In addition to the 3 main ski trails, there are many hiking and snowshoe trails at the Brandon Hills. This trail will take you on an 8 km loop that completely bypasses the ski trails. This is important, because if cross country skiers encounter snowshoers on the ski trails they may be inclined to poke them with a ski pole.",
    "directions": "South from Brandon to Hwy #349. Turn left and travel east for 3.2 km. Turn right and travel south for 1.6 km and make a left into the Brandon Hills parking area.",
