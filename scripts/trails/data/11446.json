    "description": "Again one of those just off the highway trails.  The trail is through a mixed forest and has little elevation gains so perfect for anyone.  There are ask oa couple of geocaches in there.  Good place to spend some time if you are travelling though the area.  The trails are narrow enough to make it probably fun on a mtn bike but it's not very long.",
    "directions": "Exit 9 on highway 102.  Go towards highway 2.  Turn right on highway 2 and then immediately right on Milford Recreation Association land",
