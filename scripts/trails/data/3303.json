    "description": "Elevation gain total: 4000' including the return route.This is a spectacular hike from the valley to a rugged ridge with great views of the Tombstone range and Mt Monolith. The entire route is well-marked by tape and reflective markers, but watch carefully in bad weather or when there is snow on the ground. Grizzly Lake is reached in 7-8 hours for a great area where you can camp and explore the area on dayhikes. Park staff built a nice campground, foodboxes, kitchen shelter.The hike to the lake is a great weekend trip, but the route is never easy. Lots of steep uphills, downhills and many areas of loose rocky traverses that are not easy on the legs. The route follows the open ridges for many km and you get excellent views along this.User BanffGPS added the GPS track from a long return day trip in 2017 (and more rainy photos!)",
    "directions": "Park at the 58.6km parking lot on the Dempster highway. There is a trailhead sign here, outhouse and information signs. The first part of the trail leading to the viewpoint is well used and is a moderate, but steep hike.",
