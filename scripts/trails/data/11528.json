    "description": "If you take the loop counterclockwise the incline is relatively steady for about 4 km and then there is a much steeper downhill for about 1 km at the end.  If you take it clockwise then you get a much steeper incline in the first km or so and then the last few kilometres are a more spread out descent.",
    "directions": "The trail head is now in the parking lot for the ranger station which is across the highway from the Allen Bill Pond parking lot.",
