    "description": "If I would say Meander River and fall, would you believe me?  I\u2019m always looking for waterfalls and this long river in Hants co doesn\u2019t have any known ones.  Most people will say yes but they are thinking of Little Meander falls which is described in my trailpeak post and waterfall guide.  The main river is not known to have any falls.  On a march day, I decided to check this out as I could see a promising spot on satellite imagery.\n\nThe hike there took me at first to Baileys Falls (also on trailpeak) and then continued to the Meander River.  There are some surprisingly high cliffs to check out where the stream and river meet.  Using the river ice, I traveled quickly upstream and found an old mining adit on the way there.  I finally got to where I thought there could be something.  There was something alright,  whopping 5ft drop!  I decided to post it since this river doesn\u2019t have any known falls, the adit was nice and the bonus is to see Baileys falls at the same time.",
    "directions": "Woodville Road, turn right on Ashdale Road.  Drive 1.3 km to an old woods road leading into the forest on the right.  Same trailhead as Baileys Falls",
