    "description": "This network of trails is great to do in any season. In winter the trails are groomed and tracked for classic or skate cross-country skiing. The trails pass through mature Jackpine forests, but also through smaller stands of birch and aspen. The terrain is hilly (by Manitoba standards) and trails are on mainly sandy substrate. White-tail deer, porcupine, grouse, and pine marten must be common based on the frequency of their signs and droppings! We visit these trails for a couple of days each year and consider them a real treat. There is a great bed and breakfast in nearby Grand Marais.",
    "directions": "Leaving Winnipeg, take Provincial Trunk Highway (PTH) 59 north, 80 km/49.7 mi. to the Grand Beach turnoff. Follow PTH 12 west 6 km./3.7 mi. Enter the park on at the east entrance, follow the signs to the ski parking lot and trail head (about 2 km north of PTH#12.",
