    "description": "This is a hike to two different waterfalls located close to each other. One of the fall is located approximately at  45.551396\u00b0, -62.351111\u00b0while the other is approximately located at  45.555738\u00b0,-62.346604\u00b0To see the first fall you will need to bushwack your way through a nice piece of Acadian  forest all the way down to the small brook and then follow it to the fall.  The second and quite large fall is on the French River.  For this one there is a woods road you can hike down from the Germaine Rd almost all the way to the falls.  Closeby is the Browning Brook falls which are also nice to explore.",
    "directions": "Highway 4 in Kenzieville turn on Barneys River East side rd and then on Bannerman Rd?continue until it becomes Mcgraths Mountain Rd and then turn on Germaine Rd.  Both sets are accessed through two different logging road which offshoot from the Germaine Rd",
