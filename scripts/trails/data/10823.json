    "description": "This mountain is accessible from various access points.  The point I entered and exited are within the Anthem Country Club area which is a gated community.  In order to get a car in you need to be a resident or a guest.  Pedestrians can walk into the community but it is a good 2 miles from the gates to the trail heads.   There is an access point from the NW that does not go through Anthem Country Club but I did not go that way.Because this is an extreme desert it is often difficult to distinguish between the beaten path and open country.The pinnacle of this hike to the North has a flag planted on it and has a few solar powered patio lights pointed to it.For guided hiking options in the area check out Arizona Outback Adventures.",
    "directions": "See GPS for closest addresses.  There are many ways to traverse the area.",
