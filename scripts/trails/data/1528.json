    "description": "NTS Map: 082j14\nElevation Gain: 45 m (148 ft).\nTerrace Trail is an easy snowshoeing / hiking / mtn biking trail which starts at Kananaskis Village and ends at the junction with the  Galatea Creek Trail  (or vice versa). The trail follows a terrace at the base of Mt. Kidd, above the Kananaskis River as it winds through the Kananaskis Golf Course. The left photo is Mt. Kidd. If mtn biking, this trail can become a loop by crossing the Kananaskis river at the Galatea Creek Trail and returning to the village via the highway. \nAlternate to return biking on highway is use  road for just 3 km to Wedgepond, then return via the Bill Milne paved pathway. It can be busy but it's much more pleasant than the road. This route is ride #24 in Doug Eastcott's \"Back Country Biking in the Canadian Rockies\"\"\nNote - time and distance are one way. Time will vary with activity.\nPhotos by Shelley Coffey",
