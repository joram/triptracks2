    "description": "NTS Map: 082E05Another excellent ski-club in the interior, Nickel-Plate, is near Penticton B.C.  Basically, if you get yourself to the Apex downhill ski resort, just keep going past the resort on the road as it winds and climbs it's way to the XC ski area.  Our best recollection ? sorry we were having too much of a good time ? is 5 or 10km past Apex.  Maybe somebody could clarify that. When we visited, we skied downhill for a few days at Apex, then, spent the day up at Nickel plate cross-country skiing.  Operated by the Nickel Plate XC ski club, these folks have a nice log cabin to warm up at before or after your ski.  There are over 28 km of trails, a considerable amount of it flat, but there are some advanced trails with steep slopes, namely the Panorama ridge trail.  Nickel-Plate has something for every level, and when we were there the snow conditions were excellent when many other areas were melting.  Why you might ask, well, at an elevation of over 2,000 meters, this area is high and dry ? we were pleasantly surprised.  A day fee applies, but again, if you are on an interior tour of XC ski clubs, this is a great stop.",
