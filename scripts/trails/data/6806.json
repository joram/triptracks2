    "description": "Located within the campground of Brudenell Provincial park, this unnamed trail runs the banks of Norton's Creek, which is the large feature you cross as you enter the tent site area of the park. It's one of two official trails in the area; the second one being the one that circumnavigates Brudenell Island. If you go there before June, you can also hike / mtn bike the horse trail.\nThough damp in some sections, this trail is beautifully built, and also features some boardwalk / bridge sections so that you can cross the narrowest part of the waterway. This is more of a linear trail that takes you from one part of the camp ground into the perimeter area of an older, unused section to the north.",
    "directions": "From Pool's corner, head east along Route 3, until you see the turn off to Brudenell Provincial park to the right. Drive along until you reach the office to the camp ground. Continue on straight, where you cross the main bridge. The road Vs around the laundy building. There, on the left is the sign for the trailhead.",
