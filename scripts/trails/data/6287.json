    "description": "Fun trail with an excellent view.  The trail is clearly marked for the entire  way, just look out for a split where you want to go to the right.  You will start on some switch backs and gain elevation until you reach the peak.  The  last section can be quite slippery after a rainfall so be careful.",
    "directions": "Go North from Hiway 7A up Coast Meridian Road 5.0km, turn right (East) onto Harper road and follow to parking lot.  Park just outside of the Burke Mountain Gun Range.",
