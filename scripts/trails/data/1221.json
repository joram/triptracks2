    "description": "NTS Map:92F12, NTS Map:92F11. \r\n\r\nA steep trail, with an elevation gain of 1,040 meters.  The trail will take you through some old growth forest on its way up top to flower ridge.  Along the way there are glimpses of beautiful snow capped mountains on the other side of Buttle Lake.  Once you get to the top there are awesome panoramic views of the surrounding areas.  The view of Mt. Myra is beautiful.  Well worth the grind to the top.  We like to do up to here as a day hike, but you can easily follow the ridge deeper into Strathcona and do a multi-day backpack.",
    "directions": "Take the Island highway north to Campbell River, then hang a left to Strathcona Park along highway 28.  Then take Westmin Road south until you get to the flower ridge trail parking lot.  It took us about 1.5 hours from Courtenay to get here.",
