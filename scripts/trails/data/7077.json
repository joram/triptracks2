    "description": "The Lookout Trail is likely the most popular day hike trail in Algonquin Park.  The trail climbs steeply to a lookout with a spectacular view.  The trail has recently been \"upgraded\" and is now a hard-packed gravel trail throughout the 1.9km loop trail.  Having hiked the trail before the \"upgrade\" I can tell you that the trail was much better before.  However, it is likely that trail erosion was becoming a problem wih the number of hikers of this popular trail.  The trail to and from the the lookout is not that special. After the lookout the trail descends quickly back to the trailhead.  This is a trail that I never miss when visiting Algonquin.  A great hike if you have an hour to spare.",
    "directions": "The Lookout Trail is located at kilometre 40 on Highway 60 which crosses the southern part of Algonquin Park.",
