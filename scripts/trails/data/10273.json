    "description": "Time and distance are for a loop. This hike is a great one for all ages and passes by fine coastal scenery. The trail starts at the following grid reference-47 N 33.839 N and 53 11.916 W near the Cupids Haven Bed and Breakfast. The trail has various lengths depending on which branch you take but over all should take no more than 1 - 1.5 hours. Of course you may wish to stay long since there are many places to have lunch or snack as you watch the waves roll in. The trail passes by several abandoned communities which are marked today by large meadows. Also passes a large sea arch - watch your footing here.",
