    "description": "This is on of a few urban routes you can do on PEI. Living on a small island, water isn't all that far from home.\r\n\r\nThis one is minutes away, and lends itself to a easy launch site at the end of Colonel Gray Avenue.\r\n\r\nThe route takes you out to Charlottetown Harbour, and into the openings of both the North River and the West River.  As a result, the currents can be a bit weird at times depending on the tides and winds.\r\n\r\nThis is a great leasurely paddle, with views of shore birds, water front houses and the city park. Because the water is in such a public area, be wary of power boaters. Mind the buoys.\r\n\r\nOther destinations along this route would include heading toward Rocky Point to see the red cliffs of sandstone, or to continue further up the West River, or to do a short little loop within the North River.",
    "directions": "In Charlottetown, take North River Road, and turn to shore at Col. Gray avn. Head to the end of the road.",
