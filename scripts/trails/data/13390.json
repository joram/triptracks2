    "description": "This is a nice and short hike to gorgeous waterfall nestled in the hills above West Bay, Cape Breton Island.  This particular fall is well known in the area but not too much in terms of foot traffic.  You can even see it on some satellite imagery.  The trail, yes an actual trail, starts at the end of a actually quite good logging road.   The ATV trail can be muddy however so be careful on wearing your white sneakers!  after just about 400m , look on the right of the trail for a rope tied to a tee.  You should also hear the fall by that point.  Climb down the ravine and the fall will be right in front of you.  There is a secondary fall on the left that may be flowing if there is enough volume of water.",
    "directions": "West Bay Highway to Dundee.  Turn on a new dirt road at N45 42 50.3 W61 03 28.2.  This will be the start of an outrageous steep climb.
