    "description": "This is a short hike to Gillifan Lake.  The land was donated to the Nature Trust of NS.   The trail is through a softwood dominant forest.  There is a sign at the entrance that captures the nature of the gift.  There aren't many hikes in this region of NS so even if it's a short one, I decided to add it to the database",
    "directions": "Highway 308 in Tusket.  Follow the 308 until Coldstream Rd on your left.  Drive up the Coldstream rd to the start of the trail which has the signage",
