    "description": "Oliver to Osoyoos - the trail follows the Okanagan river channel from Oliver to the marsh area at the head of Osoyoos Lake. \nBy travelling  7km utilizing No 22 road and highway 97 you could get to Osoyoos from the end of the trail. Note Highway 97 is rather busy though.\nThere are no hills it's flat all the way. About 10 km of the trail at the Oliver end is paved.\nIt's a trip through wine country with orchard and vineyard views. There are places one could detour to a winery especially near either end or the trail.\nFor much of distance trail exists on both sides of the river.",
    "directions": "Oliver - north or Oliver towards Vaseux Lake, parking is opposite the Oasis Gas station also near the entry to J Triggs winery.
