    "description": "The Portage trail to get from the parking lot to Murtle Lake.  \rWhen opened by Rick Hansen it was billed as wheel chair accessible.  The surface has deteriorated since then, but it is an easy hike and generally easy to roll a canoe cart along.  A few sandy or muddy areas.  Some of the hills are steeper when you are dragging a loaded canoe behind you!",
    "directions": "BC Highway #5 to Blue River.   Look for the signs on the side of the highway directing you to Murtle Lake.  A winding, narrow, gravel forest service road is easy to follow.  Bumpy and rough at times, but usually passible in a car.  Drivng time is about an hour, total distance is 27 km.",
