    "description": "The Saddleback circuit takes you from Lake Louise to a scenic pass studded with majestic alpine larches, and then down through Sheol Valley to Paradise Valley, returning to Lake Louise by a forested trail. You can shorten the trip by going only to the Saddleback (3.7 km, 2.3 hours return), the highlight of the circuit, featuring a sublime view of the glaciated north face of Mt. Temple. From the Saddleback, you can scramble up the steep (loose stones on the path) trail to Fairview Mtn. (1.3 km, 400 m above the Saddleback), with outstanding views of the Lake Louise cirque,",
    "directions": "Located in the Bow River Valley 1 km south of Lake Louise. Banff Park, Alberta. Access to trailhead from SE public parking lot of Lake Louise.",
