    "description": "Edwards Rating: II (III) M MELEVATION of 1060 m NET, 1248 m TOT and max 2787 m6 to 10 hoursGPS TRACK: Involves some bushwhacking before the 3rd bridge and the base of the avalanche gully + route finding/hands on scrambling all the way up if getting to the ridge farther as we did on our way up (moderate to difficult).This is an easy to moderate scramble because it involves a bit of bushwhacking and some route finding in the gullies, rock bands and around the cliffs. Views are absolutely stunning and this worth the 16 km return: Mount Temple, Pinnacle Mountain, Eiffel Peak, Horseshoe Glacier and Lake, Haddo Peak, Lake Annette, etc.From Paradise Creek parking lot, take the obvious Lake Annette trail up to the 3rd bridge. Just before that bridge on the right side of the creek, you will start bushwhacking for a few minutes to get to the base of a large avalanche gully to your right, lying under one of the highest peak of the ridge (not even the summit!). You will see some orange flags to guide you. An alternative route we've seen on our down is the old and good trail (now closed, you should see the sign, we didn?t?!) where the Lake Annette sign is hooked on a tree.Once in the gully, take your time to look at the possible routes.  You will see where it splits close to the highest peak. For an easy scramble, stay on its right and get closer to the ridge as soon as you can. You will get to a ledge along a cliff band and will go right to reach the ridge as soon as you get to the end of that band. Rock formations and colours are incredible, but sometimes unstable, be careful.  Our GPS route up is kind of silly as we rather cut straight to the right and under the ridge for a long and fun scramble with a lot of hands on/route finding from gully to gully, reaching the ridge closer to the official summit for an easy ridge walk to complete our ascent. I do not recommend that route if you?re not comfortable with route finding throughout gullies and rock/cliff bands.We descended using the easiest trail for a while but took the avalanche gully down the farthest line and it was not the best option. You may want to go down the same way you came.",
    "directions": "From Calgary, follow Trans-Canada Hwy/AB-1 W to the Bow Valley Parkway exit toward Lake Louise. Turn left and continue onto Lake Louise Dr for 2.2 km. Turn left on Moraine Lake Rd for 2.4 km to the Paradise Creek parking lot.",
