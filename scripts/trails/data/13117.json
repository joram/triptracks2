    "description": "This is a shorty but a goody.  A little leg stretcher on the side of the TCH.  The walk is about 400m on a logging road.  suitable for just about anybody.  This fall has been known for a long time as it was depicted on a black and white postcard for Cape Breton.  As of December 2018, the twin part of the fall is not true has there is woody debris blocking one side.  However its still worth the small hike to it.",
    "directions": "Park at; N45.98238\u00b0 W61.03442\u00b0.  this is where Argyle Brook flows under TCH.  Its about 2.5km before you get to the turn off to the Little Narrows Ferry if heading east.  The falls are on Argyle Brook but are mostly known by the name Twin Falls or Logan Glen Falls (name of the logging road).",
