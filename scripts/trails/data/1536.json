    "description": "The wentworth trails have probably been made more popular by mouintain biking, but are great for hiking too by summer, and xc skiing and snowshoeing come winter. It's a perfect place for orienteering practice as well, and may be a spot where that is taught.\r\n\r\nThe trails are well marked in terms of signage, but anyone with little sense for direction can quickly get disoriented.\r\n\r\nIt's a great spot for wildlife, and on the occasions I've been there, I've seen deer, an owl, and what appeared to be bear prints.\r\n\r\nThis set of trails is situated next to the Hostel facility. In the region is the wentworth ski hill offering several runs ans a few quad chair lifts.",
    "directions": "Travelling from Moncton, take exit 7 at Mahoney's Corner. Travelling from Truro, take exit 11 to Folley Lake.",
