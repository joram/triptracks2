    "description": "Plateau Mountain, Sentinel Peak, Iron Creek Mountain, Hailstone Butte traverse. 24km round trip and we somehow managed to avoid any bad bush whacking! 1500m total gain. Took us 8.5 hours including the time we spent on each summit. There was some scree but nothing that I would consider scrambling and my dog had no issues with the terrain.",
    "directions": "Park near the intersection of Highway 532 (Closed in winter) and Range rd 42A. Then walk about 200m down the road heading west to join the ridge for Plateau Mountain.",
