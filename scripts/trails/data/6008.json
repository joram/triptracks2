    "description": "It's a relaxing walk or ride along mostly flat trail with view of the valley.  You get orchards, vineyards and desert all in the same picture.\nThe path is all relatively loose gravel so it can require some effort to ride, but it's an easy scenic walk.\nThere is bench with view before the airport then a location for another beside Highway 3. The section past the airport can be noisy.",
    "directions": "It begins at the West end of 62nd Avenue just north of Osoyoos Secondary school",
