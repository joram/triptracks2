    "description": "Jura Creek is a fun hike that can be done almost any time of the year.  In spring with high water flows a person would want to exercise caution.  The highlights of the creek is the narrow canyon to explore with rock formations and various cascading pools.  If a person is very adventerous, they can continue up the valley to the pass into the ghost river area near Devil's Gap.",
    "directions": "Park across from the Baymag plant on highway 1A about 15 minutes southeast of Canmore.",
