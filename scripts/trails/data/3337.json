    "description": "Celestine Lake Campground is located on a Rocky Mountain lake shore.  The water is cold clear.  It gets deep very fast although there appears to be a sand bottom it is more of a mud.  It is refreshing after a hot hike up from the trail head.\r\n The trail was once a road and is not difficult nor overly challenging.  This is a good 1st backpack or simple excursion for a weekend. See this trail description as well, epecially for hours of travel in each direction.\r",
    "directions": "27km from Yellowhead Highway on the Snaring River Campground Rd, 9km north of Jasper. This is a timed one way road. Check with the \r\npark officials for Campground reservations.",
