    "description": "Part of the Westside trail network.This is the main trail to access the Westside Trails in Williams Lake.  It's mainly level (all the Williams Lake trails start on the flat plateau above town).  Lots of skiny structures and a couple of small jumps.  Excellent fun.It's a short trail, but part of a one to two hour ride depending on how fast you want to go.",
    "directions": "Uphilll to the west on the Chilcotin Hwy (Hwy 20).  After the big corner, take Hodgson Rd up the hill.  Go across the powerlines at the top of hte hill, and follow the road where the most traffic has been until you see a ramp and log stunt on the right.  If you do a swoopy sort of s turn past some swamps, you're almost there.",
