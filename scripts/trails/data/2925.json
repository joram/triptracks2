    "description": "Shotgun is the mountain bikers home trail for the Mission Woodlot area, pretty much dropping you at your car door.  It's mellow, smooth, flowy and natural, a good first ride if you haven't ridden the area before.  From Hoots it's worth the short climb back up, but it's a natural downhill finish for Snakes and Ladders, Quickhit and Toadstool.\nMore information on the Mission Woodlot trails can be found here.\n\nThe Woodlot - Maple Ridge, B.C., Canada \nShotgun Helmet Cam\nmore mountain biking videos can be found here",
