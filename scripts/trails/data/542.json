    "description": "Zoa Ridge  Coquihalla Highway.  This little hike is a great quick foray into what the Coquihalla area can offer. If you are driving to the interior and need a break of a few hours to either discipline recalcitrant children or to take breath of the alpine this hike will likely be fine.Drive toward the summit of the Coquihalla Highway and take the Falls Lake Exit just west of the toll booth. Travel under the highway and follow the paved road left and uphill. At its end, in about a kilometre, park. Cross Falls Creek (ignore the trail to Falls Lake; that trail I think is better for smaller recalcitrant kids) and travel the road for about 100 metres and follow the trail into the bush. The trail climbs steeply for a short distance before it joins the Trans-mountain pipeline access. Follow this uphill for less the a kilometre to almost the height of land, to a rock cairn and look for a bluffy scramble start to the Zoa Ridge Trail proper. The pipeline portion of the trail is regularly brushed out and the path is quite evident and easy to follow. Gain elevation for about and hour through open forest and interior grassland before reaching the alpine. Heather and stunted firs soon appear in a landscape that becomes predominately granitic. Views open to all the peaks in the area. The north face of Yak is quite dominant to the south and rounded peaks of the east side of Anderson River group are noticed to the west.In roughly 2 hours you can be on the high point of the ridge at over 1700 metres. This is a nice hike to do in the fall when all the foliage has turned red and a dusting of snow has covered the ground.The summit of Coquihalla Highway is about 2 hours from Vancouver and the hike is roughly 3 to 4 hours return.",
