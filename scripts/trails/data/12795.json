    "description": "I first noticed these falls on satellite imagery.   There was one long white streak I could see in the forest along the brook.  I had noticed this in the winter months and had to wait until July to make it to this distant-to-me location.  I wish I could say that it was worth the wait but I would be lying.   However, the falls are nice enough if you are already in the area to make a detour to see them.  Also, the hike to see them is quite short which is another plus!The dirt road leading closest to the fall is well maintained and should be driveable with most vehicles.  Park close to the brook and then walk through a recently thinned evergreen forest, then a small patch of leafy forest before you go down the ravine.  I was quite excited by the sound of the water and I could see numerous rocky cliffs!The walk upstream of the ravine revealed a few falls one of which is about 15ft high.  The rest are more cascade type of about 3-6ft.",
