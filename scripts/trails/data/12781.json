    "description": "Four Mile Trail goes from Yosemite Valley floor to the top of Glacier Point in a little over four miles one way. It's the only official trail on the south side of the Yosemite Valley to go straight from the valley floor to the top. The trail is out and back and eight miles total. Add a few more miles and an extra hour if you plan to walk around and explore Glacier Point at the top.",
    "directions": "Yosemite Valley floor is a one way loop. Follow the loop until you see Sentinel Beach Picnic Area. The Four Mile Trail trail head is just pass the picnic area on the right. Go early since it's just road side parking and it fills very quickly.",
