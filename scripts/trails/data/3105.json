    "description": "An easy lake trip with good fishing.  Caddy lake connects to South Cross lake via a tunnel through granite and under train tracks.  South and North Cross lakes are connected the same way.  These are the only challenge when the water is high, but can be portaged if necessary.  A popular route, so expect some well used (read littered) campsites and motorboats (read inconsiderate speeders) on Caddy and South Cross lakes.",
    "directions": "160 km east of Winnipeg on the Trans-Canada Highway and 13 km North on Provincial Highway 44 West, follow the signs to Caddy Lake.  Launch at the boat launch.",
