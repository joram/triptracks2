    "description": "This is the shortest of 4 loops making up the Etienne Brule trail system in Samuel de Champlain Provincial Park. It starts from the trail head map sign near Long Lake. The trail starts on a gentle incline through a mature pine forest. Follow the red trail makers. After the branch to the left the trail quickly ascends some steeper hills, making for a challenging but enjoyable climb. The trail takes you to some great lookouts of the historic Mattawa River before turning South West away from the river and back into dense forest. Note the impressive areas with significant blow down from the storm that took place in the summer of 2006. \r",
    "directions": "Samuel de Champlain Provincial Park is located off Highway 17 approx 10 km West of the town of Mattawa and 45km East of North bay. Once in the park follow the signs to the Etienne Brule Trailhead. \rDon't be discouraged by the Closed sign present in the winter on the Samuel de Champlain sign on Highway 17, the campgrounds are closed in the winter but the trail systems are open, most roads are plowed, and this trail makes for a challenging but enjoyable snowshoe. You may wish to park at the Canadian Ecology Centre as the road to the trailhead is not plowed.",
