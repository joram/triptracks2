    "description": "Hmm, how would I describe this one?  How about, imagine a flat area where wood, time and creativity all meet to make what could be one of the most interesting XC mountain bike experiences in Ontario. Thanks to the many hours 'donated' but the CFMBA crew, we all can have a free and great place to ride.  Every time I go, there are new stunts and obstacles.  With names like 'Mr. Wiggly', 'Double-D' and 'Son of Mr. Skinny' how can you go wrong?  \r\n\r\nYou can also see more information on the official website:\r\n\r\nhttp://gatewayriders.50megs.com/index.htm\r\nThere is GPS data attached to this trail (see \"download GPS\"), which if loaded into your GPS can help you find route points.",
    "directions": "From Ottawa: Take the 417 East to the 138.  Go south and take a Left at #1B, King's Road.  Take another Left at McCuaig's Corners.  Then it's just a short drive to Caber Road (on your right).  The CFMBA is down Caber Road about 1 km.\r",
