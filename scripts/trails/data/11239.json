    "description": "This trail is a mostly flat, wooded trail with easy paths that are mowed weekly. You walk under trees and in open fields. There are many people who walk their dogs on this trail. The area is a conservatory that was donated by a family in honor of their child.",
    "directions": "From 202 take W Swedesford Rd toward Malvern. Turn right onto N Valley Rd and go over the small bridge. Travel .3 miles on N Valley Rd and the parking lot is on your right. It is a poorly marked unpaved parking lot. If you pass Treeline Dr on your left you have gone to far.",
