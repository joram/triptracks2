    "description": "Great loop with a buncha climbing (540m in 5.1km plus some other climbing) that can be combined with many others in the area to make a day or weekend out of it.  Has a number of fairly technical areas but is a great trail.\nYou can see parts of it in the movie attached to Fernie Gorby Verboten  (pops up in a new window).\nYou can do this at any pace you want, it is a great technical, fun buncha singletrack.  Strongly recommended (as is virtually all of Fernie).",
    "directions": "Head a little South of town, turn right (West) on Mt. Fernie Provincial Park Road.  Park just outside the park gates (where it is free).  Ride through the park about 450m exactly, look for Hedonism on Right.",
