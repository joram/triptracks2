    "description": "A loop from either end of Cameron Lake over Mt. Wesley and Wesley Ridge, with return along the tracks and Chalet road.  A shorter (2 1/2 hr. return) hike from McBey Creek to the radio tower on Wesley Ridge provides a pleasant leg-stretcher through mixed forest with arbutus, and great views of the lake and the east coast of Vancouver Island.\rEastern portion of trail is well marked, but between Salmon Hill (about the mid point of the ridge) and the western slope of Mt. Wesley its pretty much a sporadically flagged bushwhack. (GPS track in this section is dictated more by soft snow and abhorrence for postholing than by intelligent route finding...)\rFrom Cathedral Grove, head along Chalet Road and look for faint flagged trail just past second cabin.  At tracks, head east 250 meters and look for flagging and enormous rope.  In gap between Mt. Horne and Mt. Wesley follow flagging through slash and head up ridge.\rFrom McBey Creek, follow tracks east over bridge and look for flagged trail in about 100 meters.",
    "directions": "East end - park between Hwy. 4 and railroad tracks at McBey Creek, about 3.4 km. west of turnoff to Little Qualicum Falls.\rWest end - park at Cathedral Grove and walk past outhouses, or continue a bit West and park at gated end of Chalet Road.",
