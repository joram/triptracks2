    "description": "Comfortably Numb is one of Whistler's epic single track rides, starting from about 10km north of Whistler and ending just north of Nesters, near Lost Lake Park.  There are Lots of short climbs, switchbacks, and rock faces, awesome views at the summit and great scenery.  The trail can be ridden in either direction.  The southern section is steeper and more technical, so some like to start from here, hike-a-bike this, and enjoy the long flowy downhill.  The trail is a bag of fun either way you do it, so there's no good reason to ride Comfortably Numb only once.Comfortably Numb was originally built as two separate trails, Secret Trail first, then North Secret.  North Secret is still often done as a shorter variant, exiting via Young Lust.This trail  will put the fun back into cross country riding for anyone willing to take the time to ride it.",
    "directions": "Wedge mountain parking lot, a 20 minute pedal north from whistler on hwy 99. Go through the parking lot and go left, follow the road for about half a kilometer. The trail will be on your right hand side.",
