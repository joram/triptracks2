    "description": "This urban walk starts at the arena (Great Pacific Forum) that is under the Alex Fraser bridge (Surrey side) Park at the end of the arena, and walk under the highway ramp to the start. The walk takes you on 2 wooden pathways in the bog, and continues along the BN tracks. You can walk on one side and return on the other. This walk ends at 64th Ave, and takes about 2-3 hours. On the shorter wooden pathway is the remains of a large tractor embedded in the bog. I'm not sure how it got there.\r",
    "directions": "Follow Highway 91 North or South and take the River Road/Nordel Way exit (follow the signs for River Road). This puts you onto Nordel Way, heading north. \r\nTurn right at the second set of traffic lights onto Nordel Court and continue to the Great Pacific Forum (10388 Nordel Crt). \r\nPark in the southeast corner of the parking lot where you will find a red brick path. \r\nFollow the path to the left and under the Nordel Way overpass.
