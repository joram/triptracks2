    "description": "I'm super happy to have explored this brook near Bucklaw for waterfalls. It flows under the TCH and looks like it wouldn't have anything on it. Thousand of people drive by everyday but few if any explore it! It's only about 2ft wide BUT if you follow it above the powerline, you will enter a virtual Shangri-La of falls. This super small brook has carved an impressive ravine or gorge and this has created numerous waterfalls of between 10-25ft in height. Only go after a rainfall has the brook doesn't drain a large area. Keep going up the brook as sometimes there is a flat area and then more falls upstream! It was easy to deduce since there was a lot of foam in the water. stats for the hike; 2km, 180m elevation and 38min.",
    "directions": "There is a path to the powerline located right between two guardrails (approx N46.00420 W60.99808)! Once at power lines, find the brook and follow it upstream.  Last falls of a good size is at; N46.00845 W61.00363",
