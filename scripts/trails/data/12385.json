    "description": "Steep 1150 metre climb of 6 Km to the high point of the ridge at 2510 metres. Starting at Two O'Clock campground (behind outhouse near the newly numbered campsite #4) the trail starts by crossing Two O'Clock Creek (named for high water warning at Two O'Clock) and gradually ascends a flower laden escarpment before an unrelenting climb. Great views of Tuff Puff to the left and colourful ranges to the right, but you must continue straight up to a well deserved double cairn lunch stop!",
    "directions": "The campground entrance is 22 km west of the Banff National Park boundary on Highway 11, or 61 km east of Nordegg.",
