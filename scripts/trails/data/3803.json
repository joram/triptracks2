    "description": "Kingdom trails is a network of trails.  There are about 100 miles of trails.  The trails are well maintained by the Kingdom Trails Association.  They have from beginner to expert.  There is a fee of $10 dollars to use the trails.  It helps to maintain the trails, and the KTA also get access rights to private lands for the trails.  It is some of the best single track around.  They have it all mapped and marked with signage.  You can ride other areas, but they lack the up to date mapping and signs.  It is worth a weekend trip to ride some awesome single track.\nThe KTA closes the trails to mountain biking in late fall until late spring when all the snow is gone and the trails are dry.  They will close the trails after it rains to prevent erosion and damage to the trails.  It also helps minimize the amount of trail maintainence that needs to be done.\nOne of my favorite trails is Upper Dead Moose.",
    "directions": "They are located in East Burke Village on Route 114 situated in the heart of the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont. Their Welcome Center is located behind Bailey's and Burke General Store (Spring, Summer & Fall only). \nFor info check out their website: www.kingdomtrails.org",
