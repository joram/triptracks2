    "description": "Old school gnarl, new school flowy ramps, and a little bit of a x-country action. This is a great trail to hone your skills. It rides equally well wet or dry. If you've mastered Pipeline, try this one!More Mt Fromme mountain biking trails can be found here.",
    "directions": "Climb the fire road, at the top of Mountain Highway, to the 5th switchback. About 5 minutes past the 5th switchback, on your left hand side the trail is marked.Once you reach the Baden-Powell trail (bottom of Ladies, T-intersection), go left, and stay on the Baden-Powell to hit the bottom of the fire road.   Go left again, and the Lower Ladies is entered on the right about 5 minutes down the trail (it's not clearly marked).   Go right, and then take a left at either of the first two sign posts to reach Dempsey Road.",
