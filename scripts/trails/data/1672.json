    "description": "Walk up the snowmobiler's track to the old Rainbow Ski Hill tracks. This was going to be developed back in the 1960's, but never got too far. However, the ski course is still there, and that is your hike up, at least to the lake, which is about a 35 minute climb from your vehicle.\r\n\r\nAfter you have reached the lake, the summit of Ptarmigan Mt. lies before you, and that will take some mountaineering skills. There is no trail. The first part starts off with a series of openiongs, but when you turn up the mountain, then you need your trail finding skills, zig zagging back and forth, to find how to navigate the sheer bluffs.\r\n\r\nThe pay-off is a spectacular view of the mouth of the Skeena River, as well as Rainbow Lake, the upper Skeena, the highway to Prince Rupert, and the high snow-capped mountains of the coast range.\r\n\r\nIn winter please check the Avaluator\r\n(Online Trip Planner) rating is: \r\n Complex.  \r\nSee more trip planner route details here.\r",
    "directions": "At Rainbow Summit, there is a pull off where you can park. If you have a 4X4 you can drive up the road, and park at the trail head. This will save you about 80m in elevation. The trail head is obvious due to snowmobilers using this in the winter.",
