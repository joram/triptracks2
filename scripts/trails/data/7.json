    "description": "NTS Map: 92G14Just outside of Squamish, North of Vancouver, is the lake Lovely Water sub-alpine area, which is popular with advanced hikers and climbers alike. One of the most beautiful hikes in the region, once in the alpine, camping is available at the lake, with various day hikes and climbs available from there.  The hike up the area is steep and difficult but well worth it. Make sure you are properly prepared for overnight hiking and are an experienced hiker before tackling this route.  You might consider hiring a guide, if you are not an experienced hiker or climber, because it is truly a spectacular area that should be experienced.  We've marked out the waypoints to help you locate the trail. Datum is WGS84.  Note, the topo map for this region is NAD27, so use your GPS to convert these points to NAD27 if matching on your topo map.\r\n\n\nWP,UTM,001 , 10U ,485425.0588,5515847.941\nWP,UTM,002 , 10U ,484937.1351,5516122.777\nWP,UTM,003 , 10U ,484572.3025,5515886.999\nWP,UTM,004 , 10U ,483894.6747,5516002.383\nWP,UTM,005 , 10U ,483581.5918,5515760.944\nWP,UTM,006 , 10U ,479173.721,5515146.861\nWP,UTM,007 , 10U ,479521.3889,5514385.042\nWP,UTM,ALPHA , 10U ,479506.2503,5514380.654\nWP,UTM,ALPHA2, 10U ,479520.5382,5515300.074\nWP,UTM,BEACH , 10U ,481711.1709,5514109.241\nWP,UTM,BEACH2, 10U ,480143.4631,5514207.054\n\r\nThese are; Started at 17:20, WP 001 is the trailside beside the river, close to the trailhead.  17:55 WP 002 is at a metal placoid, joins cable trail and enters clearcut. 18:20 WP 003 is dried uo stream bed, rocky.  19:25 WP 004 is first sight of \"lovely creek\". 20:05 WP 005 Waterfall (lovelywater creek).
