    "description": "An easy trail that I often run twice for a close to 10k run.  It's literally a walk in the park, with lots of squirrels in the late fall / winter and birds in the spring / summer.  Central Park is a great escape in the middle of a busy city.\nMap: NTS  092G03",
    "directions": "Central Park is in Burnaby, at the intersection of Kingsway and Boundary Rd.  Parking can be found North of the park, just off of Kingsway.  There are also free lots off of Boundary, to the West of the park, and off of Imperial, South of the park.",
