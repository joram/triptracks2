    "description": "NTS Map: 082O02Elevation Gain: 96 mMostly singletrack to summit of Eagle Hill, overlooking Chiniki Lake in Bow Valley, and looking back to Moose Mountain. Soil is loose and sandy. Trail undulates gently for 3km. A short but steep climb (20% grade) with a few tricky roots follows junction, then more undulating terrain before a short descent to a creek. From here its all up to the top (11% grade average) with a few switchbacks and loose sections to challenge you. Views from the top are great.\r\n\r\nThe descent can be as fast as you like! Once back at the 3km junction, there is the option of climbing Deer Ridge (nearly as high as the hill you just came down). The seismic cutline is steep (17% grade) then the climb to the ridgetop a little less so, but with rock gardens to negotiate as you climb. The descent is worth it, just look out for a couple of switchbacks. A final cruise past Sibbald Lake takes you back to the start.",
    "directions": "Turn off transcanada onto Hwy 68. Sibbald Lake campground turnoff at 23km on right. Keep left for parking, trailhead 100m backtrack along road from parking.",
