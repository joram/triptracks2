    "description": "An easy hike for 3km the last 0.8km is a real workout!  Its so worth the walk, bring a towel and sandles for a swim at the base of the falls... Shrinkage as the water is cold enough to cool beer! Although tough there are a number families that can bring there kids.  My 6 year old pulled it off; that first km returning is hard, especially on the kids. \r\n\r\nWhat a waterfall! \r\n\r",
    "directions": "Fundy Park along 114 take the Laverty auto route until you get to the trail head (about 1.5km from highway)",
