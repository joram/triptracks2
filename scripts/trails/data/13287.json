    "description": "Southeast Brook in the Gros Morne NP has a well know trail to the top of a well known fall.  But as I was in the area for a few days, I spotted some telltale signs of some more falls on this brook.  this is one of them.I parked on the shoulder and bushwacked downhill to the river to my waypoint.  the bushwacking is fairly easy and the fall from the highway is about 400m in  distance.  The fall is a nice three tier drop.  The topmost drop is probably the most scenic one but it is hidden by the rock formation around it.",
