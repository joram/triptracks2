    "description": "I started the hike from Frost Trail in Underhill. Then, I took Maple Ridge Trail to reach to the junction of Long Trail.  Then, I took Long Trail toward South to get to Butler Lodge.  I took a break, ate lunch, then, moved on LT South for 1.7 miles.  Then, I took Nebraska Notch Trail which is very gradual decsent which is nice for knees.",
    "directions": "From Underhill Center, take Stevensville Road approx 2.8 miles, you'll see the small parking lot at the end of this road.(It's free).  One of most popular trail for Mt Mansfield Hike is Sunset Ridge Trail, but, you'll be required to pay the parking fee since trail starts from Underhill State Park.\rSo I prefer to start from either Frost Trail or Butler Lodge Trail with free parking.",
