The trail heads up the mountain some 2.8 miles before you head along the ridge on the National trail to begin yoru descent on the Kiwanis trail and back to the trailhead.  Mostly well marked and incredible views of Phoenix and south on the Indian reservation.For bike rentals: We rented in Scottsdale (near Phoenix) at AOA-adventures for great weekly rates on GIANT and Specialized, allowing you to ride nearby McDowell Preserve or South Mountain before heading to Sedona.",
