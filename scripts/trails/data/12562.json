    "description": "The start of this trail is STEEP, about 15% grade on average but most of it is at the start. Straight up switchbacks for about an hour or more depending on your speed. After the junction with the First Brigade trail you get to a view point and head down into the woods. You travel this well flagged trail until you come to an old but obvious logging road and rejoin the trail on the other side.  From here on the trail is overgrown and difficult to follow but there is flagging all the way to the top. Once you get to the top you see and old fire lookout and some antennas and stuff but get some decent views of the forested mountains around you. This was not a fun hike and not worth the reward in my opinion but it was in 103 hikes and I'm trying to do all of them.",
    "directions": "Follow highway 1 north from hope, past Yale and about 5 km past Alexandra lodge there is a pullout to the left with a small weather station . Park here and walk back down the highway about 100 m and look at the top of the rock wall and you will see flagging. This is the trail head.",
