    "description": "Sun Peaks operates a downhill mountain bike park, with all levels of difficulty being served.\nThe Sunburst Express quad chair takes riders to a trails park up top, and then leaves the rider with a variety of trail options, such as; route 66, Insanity One, Sugar, Sweet One, Bambi, Kaboom.  See the attached map. Intermediate trails like Gummy Bear can be done over and over, a hybrid of downhill and technical, mixing steeps with small drops and tight corners.\nSun peaks joins the growing list of ski resorts that created bike runs in the summer.  These runs have 2000 feet of vertical.  Can you compare it to Whistler?  No.  But they each have their appeals.  One thing I absolutely loved about Sunpeaks is NO CROWDS.  Admittedly, July 2nd was a Wednesday, but I had a riot on the intermediate trails and North Shore trails in the trees with tight corners, roots, and assorted ladders.  But if you hit a bike park, you're likely there for downhill thrills, and drops, of which there are many.\nSun Peaks is located near Kamloops B.C.",
