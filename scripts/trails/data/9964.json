    "description": "We did this trip in as a Winter scramble. Would've been great if the views were a little better as it was cloudy and 70 kmh winds at the top. \nThe approach is parking at Nakiska Ski resort and ascending one of the side trails on the north. Eventually break off towards Collembola. You will have to \neventually descend into a gully (do this lower) or you will be forced up Fisera \nRidge.\nWe needed our snow shoes for the steep snow slope that had grass underneath. \nThe crampons on the snowshoes helped the ascent up to this point. We stashed our snowshoes before the rock bands. There was a lot of scree at this point and seemed very difficult to gain any elevation quickly. But we trudged through it and eventually summitted while having to block ourselves from the wind every 50 to 100 meters.",
