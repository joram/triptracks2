    "description": "A very interesting paddle circumnavigating part of Saturna, North and South Pender, and Prevost Islands.  The route traverses some of the inner passages of the Gulf Islands, the southwest end of Georgia Strait, and part of Boundary Pass with three nights of excellent campsites on Cabbage Island, Beaumont Marine Park on South Pender Island, and Prevost Island.  If the air is clear, there are views to the San Juans to the south, the Olympic Mountains to the south, Vancouver and the Canadian Coastal Range to the north and east, and the mountains of Vancouver Island to the west.  There is a good likelihood of seeing Steller Sea Lions, Orcas, Dall?s Porpoise, and many nesting birds along the cliffs of Saturna and Pender Islands.  At low tide there will be good opportunities to see exposed marine life along the shores.  Since part of this trip is in open water, you may may be paddling in a swell or some waves.   There are currents in some of the narrower passages that cause eddies and standing waves.",
    "directions": "From the Tsawwassen Ferry Dock (Vancouver), unload, park in the long-term parking lot, and roll your kayaks on to the ferry.  At Village Bay on Mayne Island you will unload and roll our kayaks to the beach next to the ferry dock and launch.  You may also begin this ferry route from Swartz Bay north of Victoria.",
