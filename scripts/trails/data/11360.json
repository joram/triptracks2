    "description": "This is a very picturesque waterfall really close to the road.  My gps track will show you the local way to access the fall very quickly although you need to be careful as the slop is a bit steep and ice covered in different times of the year.I wandered a bit near the parking lot trying to find a way down the escarpment but the upper reaches area good 30ft feature so just go to the viewpoint and right next to it, you will find a faint trail and access to the gorge.  Again the forest down there is a mature deciduous so it?s easy to walk.  After only about 10 min you will be rewarded by a good size waterfall which looks very good for ice climbing as it is very thick.  Facing the waterfall, I was able to find a faint trail to the left of it which came right back to the road and reduced the travel time in half at least.",
    "directions": "Highway 5. Turn on Rock Chapel rd and find the (pay) parking lot.",
