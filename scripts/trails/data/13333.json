    "description": "The area to the south of Sydney is better know for some wild and gorgeous coastal scenery but it also holds a few hidden waterfalls. This is one of them. I ended up exploring along this brook after spotting an interesting white streak on satellite imagery. I was going to spend a few nights in Mira River Provincial Park and this brook was just a few km down the road. I parked at the guardrail over the stream and started to bushwack upstream. The walking is neither hard or easy. I saw a fall but it seemed that the sat imagery was showing something larger so I kept going upstream. That is until I hit a lake and then I knew I had gone too far. I went back to the original fall of about 15 feet. It\u2019s a slider type fall. I wouldn\u2019t give tis fall a second glance except that this is an area that is very poor in terms of them so it\u2019s worth the trek if you are already in the area.",
