    "description": "This is an excellent cardio trail. The climb is a dual track strenuous climb up to the top in which is in excellent condition, the surface is made of gravel and grass. The last third of the trail is a very interesting single tack going downward. For some reason, I always have this feeling of being far far away from civilization there. Bring a GPS with the trail preloaded before going there as there are many other trails that leads to unknown destinations. Do this trail in counter clockwise (as in the GPS track).\r\rNote, the duration is for mountain biking.\rMultiply by 2-3 for hiking and bu 3-4 for showshoeing.",
