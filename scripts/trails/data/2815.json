    "description": "An average difficulty trail. Doing with a big group would take around 6-7 days, but with just a few adults, you can get it done in around 3-4 days. I suggest getting into good shape before attempting this trail. I am a 14 year old, I went with a group of about 20, between ages of 11-14. it took us a good 6 days, but we were realaxed. There is one 2.4 km Portage that we dubbed \"Cardiac Hill\"...Straight up, Straight down. Very hard to portage the canoe when you're going straight down the side of a mountain. Overall, this was a great trip...46th on the 100 things to do in BC before you die list...Trailpeak editorial note: This is the 2nd submission for Powell Forest Canoe Route, it came with some excellent GPS waypoints, so we are leaving this entry, but please search for \"Powell\" in trail name using our search engine to find the other entry.",
    "directions": "Once you are in Powell River (Ferry to Sunshine Coast, ferry to Powell River) drive east on Highway 101 until you reach \"Mitchell's Canoe and Kayak Rental\". You can park your car there and they will drive you in.",
