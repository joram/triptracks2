    "description": "This trail runs you into snakes and ladders.  Take the right off the main road not far before the power lines, or, go all the way to the power lines, take a right and not far on drop down Gate first.  Take a short right-left dogleg to drop into Tsuga from the bottom of Gate.\nThere's a few tricky rooty sections, and a couple of rock faces, but pretty much all natural.\nA short climb gets you back up to Quickhit, with a cruiser down Shotgun to finish.\nMore Mission Woodlot trails can be found here \n\nThe Woodlot - Maple Ridge, B.C., Canada \nTsuga Helmet Cam\nmore mountain biking videos can be found here",
