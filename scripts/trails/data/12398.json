    "description": "This is one of those places in NS that is slowly being engulfed by the forest and out of our collective minds.  In the middle of the woods in the late 19th century, a French family dammed a river and provided electricity to a settlement known as New France.  More info here; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_France,_Digby_County,_Nova_ScotiaThe road is in disrepair so either a good clearance on your vehicle, a mountain bike or a hike would be the preferred options here.  there used to be signing all over the settlement but now all that remains are the stone foundations.",
    "directions": "Highway 340.  Take Langford rd and turn on a secondary road on your left at; N44.27932 W65.77510 and drive or walk about 4km to the settlement",
