    "description": "A nice short canoe trip that is perfect to cram in on a weekend, or take a few more days to relax and exjoy the scenery, waterfalls, and great fishing.  The trip covers 10 lakes, all separated by small falls or short stretches of river.  Most portages are fairly short and easy, aside from a couple that are approximately 200 meters.  Good trip for earlier in the year, as some of these lakes become very warm and somewhat 'swampy' during the later months.",
    "directions": "Drive east from Kenora or West from Dryden on Hwy 17 (TransCanada Hwy).  Aproximately half way between Kenora and Vermilion bay a train bridge crosses the highway.  On the east side of this bridge there is a road off of the north side of the highway.  The put in is clearly visable and only a few hundred feet from the highway.  The trip ends on the Jones Road just north of Kenora.",
