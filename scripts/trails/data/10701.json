    "description": "This route requires tresspassing illegally on the CN Rail right of way. Park at Brandywine falls parking lot, walk south on railroad tracks. Tracks take a prominent bend right, and then back left, at which point you will find the trailhead on the right side marked by flagging tape and a FMCBC Adopt-a-Trail sign. It is a steep climb from here to Brew Lake. The section from the lake to the hut is above treeline, has no trail and must be navigated on your own. There are a few cairns here and there, but they are not continuous. Once at the lake, don't make the mistake of trying to head straight for the hut because there are cliffs in between. Instead, stay in the basin west (left) of brew lake and then climb up to the col just south of Mt. Brew, where the Brew Hut is located.",
    "directions": "Drive to Brandywine Provincial Park, 47 km North of Squamish off Hwy 99. Park here and then follow the directions above",
