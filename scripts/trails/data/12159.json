    "description": "Another ravine close to Truro caught my attention as the old maps showed a 15ft fall.   After crossing a few farmer's fields I entered the forest and made my way down a slope to the stream.  Then I decided to go downstream first....after much effort in a very dense forest...I came up empty fall-wise.  I then decided to travel upstream to where some topo lines were crossing the stream.  The walking becomes easier at mid point....the strange thing is that the stream has seen a recent flood event has the channel has changed courses at a few spots and mounds of rocks are everywhere.   The ravine becomes steeper and some rock wall appears.  However the only fall of significance is maybe 7ft high.  I returned by following the eastern side of the ravine on a well established game trail.",
