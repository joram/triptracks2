    "description": "Hart Lake Brook has a well know waterfall close to highway 4 (already described in trailpeak) but few people know of an even taller fall in the upstream section of this brook.  The hike is bushwack and it can be moderately hard as the evergreens are quite young and spaced together.  From the road, traverse a small plateau and then descend into the ravine created by the brook, you should meet the brook and the fall would be to the right.",
    "directions": "Highway 4 at Folly Lake.  Take Lafarge Rd and then turn on Old Hart Lake Road.  Park at; N45\u00b0 34' 38.1\" W63\u00b0 31' 20.9\" which is just a little bit after Humming Brid Lane.  The fall is at; N45\u00b0 34' 39.9\" W63\u00b0 31' 20.8\"",
