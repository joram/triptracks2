    "description": "This trail is a fairly short loop through some interesting terrain.  It starts out in the woods along a ridge with steep drops off both sides, and from there is a mix of singletrack, woods roads and some open fields.  There aren't really any views but the woodland is quite active with wildlife and during the spring time of year ladys slippers are blooming.  The trail is fairly well marked and is easy to follow.  It can get a bit grown over in some areas because the volume of traffic on the trail is quite low.  Be sure to check yourself for ticks after your hike if you go in early spring/summer.",
