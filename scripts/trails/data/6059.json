    "description": "The trail follows an old logging road, as well as creekbeds. It can be muddy as well as loose in places, but it is easily followed and non-technical. There are not many switchbacks, so the trail is quite direct",
    "directions": "Leaving from Vancouver take the ferry to Langdale/Sunshine Coast. In Langdale board the ferry to Gambier Island (New Brighton). The Gambier Island ferry is for passengers only. No vehicles allowed, but bikes and dogs are welcome. Once in New Brighton, follow the road to the trailhead. It is every left hand turn/fork in the road until the trailhead. The trail begins just before Mike's Bay. On the trail follow the green markers to Gambier Lake. It is basically every right turn once you begin on the trail.",
