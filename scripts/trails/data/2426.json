    "description": "A nice enjoyable hike that takes you from Mountain road, where the trail starts which connects to Waterfall trail at the top of the hill, accessible also by the Gatineau Park parkway.The secret entrance to this trail system has parking available at the Golf Club at 1483 Ch de la Montagne N. The extra loop up to King's summer place is well worth the effort.",
    "directions": "Take St Raymond to Pink road and turn left. Drive for 825 meters to Ch. de la Montagne North and turn right again. Drive for 7.4 km where you will see space on the shoulder to park.  Very limited parking however.  You can park on a side road and walk to the trailhead.  Trailhead located at N45 28.414 W75 51.316",
