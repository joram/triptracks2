    "description": "This is a Provincial Trail run by the Ministry of Forests.  The highlight is that it serves as an interpretive trail for the large Garnet fire in 1994. There is GPS data attached to this trail (see \"download GPS\"), which if loaded into your GPS can help you find route points.",
    "directions": "The Trail is 9 km. west of Penticton.  Take Carmi Road until you reach Beaverdell Road.  Turn right on Beaverdell and continue for a few more kilometres and it will be on your right.",
