    "description": "To see the famous Burgess Shales fossils, you must book a guided hike with the Burgess Shale Geoscience Foundation or Parks Canada.Most part of the trip you can do it yourself. But the last leg of the hike (to see the fossils), you must be accompanied by a guide from the Burgess Shale Geoscience Foundation or Parks Canada. It's a restricted area, and they have security cameras to ensure this.To book a hike to the Walcott Quarry, you can go to https://www.burgess-shale.bc.ca/.",
    "directions": "From the Takakkaw Fall parking log, walk to the Whister Jack Hostel, the trail starts from there.",
