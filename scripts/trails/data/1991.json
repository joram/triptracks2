    "description": "Near the location of the Yurt near Cap \r\nAux Meules, lies some of the tallest hills on \r\nthe main island. There are even \r\ncommunications towers positioned at the \r\ntop. The view from there makes for an \r\nincredible vista of the archipelago. Be there \r\nin the evenings and the sunsets are \r\ngorgeous. The entire set of islands stretch \r\neither way, and even Entree Island stands lit \r\nup in the setting sunlight, showing its red \r\ncliffs.\r\n\r\nTo reach this point, you can either take a \r\nsmall gravel road that leads to the towers, or \r\nyou can take the foot path that leads from \r\nthe yurt to truly experience the terrain. By \r\nfoot, to see both the main hill as well other \r\nsmaller ones, the return trip is around 1 Km. \r\nWe found blueberries in the fields of pasture \r\nland, as well as a roving fox.\r\n\r",
