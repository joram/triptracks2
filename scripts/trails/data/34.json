    "description": "NTS Map: 092G07The Hollyburn Snowshoe area at Cypress Mountain is accessible from the upper levels of Highway 99 as one would drive West and North out of Vancouver.  Turn right follow the switchback road up the XC ski area of Cypress moutain, and, park amoungst the XC skiiers.  The snowshoe area allows you to wander without concern for getting lost within the bounded crossc-country ski trail area.  For those seeking a little more adventure and some great views, head up Hollyburn Peak (past the end of the trail for XC skiers) and enjoy some fabulous views of the surrounding mountains, the city, Howe Sound, and, Vancouver Island.  All around excellent snowshoeing, unless of course it hadn't snowed much.  The local Vancouver mountains tend to oscillate between great snow years (as in 1999 and 2000) and otherwise acceptable conditions, but a more limited season.  Nevertheless, if you like hiking, and haven't tried snowshoeing yet, get up there and rent a pair, it can be a great workout, and a nice change from the rain in the city below.",
