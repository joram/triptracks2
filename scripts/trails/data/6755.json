    "description": "An easy to moderate hike beginning in a parking area off the Kancamagus Highwat  (NH 112) over a saddle between two peaks and then down to East Pond.  Views at the Pond are among the most spectacular in the White Mountains, especially in the Fall when the foliage is reflected in the strangely blue waters of the pond.",
    "directions": "From Kancamagus Highway (SR 112), NH, The northern trailhead is located about 1 mile east of the Big Rock Campground on SR 112 at the Hancock Branch Bridge / Otter Rocks Roadside Rest Area.",
