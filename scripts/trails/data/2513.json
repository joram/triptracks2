    "description": "This trail is a challenging alternative to those tired of the crowds and hype of the Grouse Grind. This trail is much more challenging than the Grind, involving some technical scrambling and should not be attempted by anyone without proper experience and equipment.",
    "directions": "Start off on the Grouse Grind.  After 60m or about 2 minutes turn off to your right down the Baden-Powell.   Follow posted trail markings for BCMC trails in the area.  This trail runs north off the Baden-Powell trail.",
