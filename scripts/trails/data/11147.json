    "description": "This trail is a loop of approximately 3 km. Duchesnay Falls starts as a series of low, picturesque cascades on the river. The river soon breaks into two main channels, each which tumbles over several different waterfalls. The west channel carries well over half of the river's discharge and has two main waterfalls.The lower falls on the west branch is the largest of all at Duchesnay, and is a cascade that falls roughly 8 to 10 m and is close to the same width at its base. The lower falls grades into the upper falls, which is a long cascade that drops roughly 10 m to over 20 m. Hikers can walk right to the edge of the upper falls, by diverting off the main trail and carefully walking out across the exposed bedrock.Be cautious! There aren't any steep drop-offs, but the rocks can be slippery when wet, and there are no fences at any of the falls. This trail will provide opportunity for gorgeous photography in autumn. This trail hooks up with the Education Centre Trails in many places. Signs indicate all the trail hook ups.",
