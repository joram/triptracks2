    "description": "The Tallow Rock Bay loop is one of the longer trails in Charleston Lake Provincial Park.\r\rTrail starts from the parking area and is well marked for the complete route. One should never be in the woods unless one is off the trail.\r\rCharleston Lake Park is situated on a southern extension of the Canadian shield hence it has more northly and rocky appearance.\r\rThe trails provide a pleasant walk in the forest with occasional view points. In fall leaves can be colourful.\r\rThere is also camping and boating activities available in the park.\r\rThe park staff rate the Tallow Bay trail as difficult however as the only elevation change is up and down a few dips I'd be inclined call the trail only moderately difficult there are few areas where one could slide.\r\rNote: Ontario Provinical Park fees apply to this park",
    "directions": "Charleston Lake Provincial Park is located between Kingston and Brockville and about 18 km of Highway 401. From Highway 401, take Exit 659 and proceed north on County Road 3 to Woodvale Rd. (there are signs)",
