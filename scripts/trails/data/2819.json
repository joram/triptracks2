    "description": "There is an old road that leads to Grouse mountain , it switchbacks it's way above North Vancouver and it starts from Mountain highway in Lynn Valley.If you start from the end of Mountain highway it will take you over 5 hrs to get to the summit of Grouse mountain.We started from the end of St-Georges Rd. in North Van, and there are other ways to join Old Grouse.We snowshoed up past the powerline trails to eventually catch the Baden Powell trail, you should come across some trail signs that welcome you up to the Old Grouse rd. We went up to Grouse mountain  past the ski hills and snowboarders and came back down the gondola for 5 dollars/each.",
    "directions": "From the end of Mountain Highway in Lynn Valley (North Vancouver) is where the old road starts . mTo shorten your trip up , start from St-Georges, Prospect road,Mosquito Creek. Try to organise it so a car is waiting for you upon arriving down the gondola.",
