    "description": "This trail is part of the National Capital Greenbelt trail system.  It links together four (4) of the shorter Western trails situated North of the Trailway and South or Watts Creek.\r\rThe GPS track I have provided starts at Parking Area #5 and winds its way out to the hill on Corkstown Road using the harder trails.  The return path is easy as it follows the pathways.\r\rThis is your typical Ottawa trail: a relatively flat \"rock and root\" ride.  There is a decent short climb on Trail #11. The #12 and #20 loops have some technical bits with rock hopping opportunities.\r\r",
    "directions": "You can start this at one of three of the Greenbelt Parking Areas.  All are easily accessible from the Queensway.\r\rP5: off Eagleson Road south of Hazeldean Road.\r\rP4: off Timm Road east of Eagleson Road and West of Moodie Drive.\r\rP3: off Corkstown Road east of Eagleson Road and West of Moodie Drive.",
