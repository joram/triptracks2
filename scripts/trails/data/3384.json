    "description": "In order to do this trail you are supposed to ask for permission from the Indian Band because it is reserve, so you go to talk to them and typically there is no problem... and it's so worth it because this hike is really good. If you go at an average pace up the mountain from the Sun Rivers entrance it'll be about 45 minutes up, and at the top you can walk along.. explore.. see great views of the entire valley from all sides. It is fairly consistently uphill and steep so make sure to have good footwear and lots of water, and watch for mountain goats! Rocky areas require careful footing, but it's not dangerous overall. Lots and lots and lots of shale .. that's the tough part.",
