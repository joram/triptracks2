    "description": "The only No See Um aspect to this hike is the trail! The trail is very hard to see, but stay on the right side of the creek all the way up to the headwall.Make sure you take a GPS for the headwall. The route is between the two waterfalls and I have annotated my picture with 2 important switchbacks. The route continues up over several shelves as shown. Route finding skills are necessary, especially if you want to return!The beautiful lake is only one of your rewards.",
    "directions": "Start at the pictured unmarked pull-off on the Icefields Parkway, just south of Mosquito Creek.",
