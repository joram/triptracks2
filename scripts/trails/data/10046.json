    "description": "This track is the High Rim Trail from the Kalamalka Lake Park Gate & Main parking lot. Depending on how you look at it, it is for Vernon people, the beginning of the High Rim Trail but, for the rest of the world, the end. If you want to hike the Hign Rim Trail but, want to be closer to the Repeater tower, have a look at the two trails I have posted. It is 3.5km to the pond that I have shown from the gate. While it is a pleasant hike from the Gate to the Pond, you can cut a bunch of distance if your goal is the repeater tower.\r\rhttp://www.trailpeak.com/trail-High-Rim-Twisted-Sister-near-Vernon-BC-10030\rhttp://www.trailpeak.com/trail-High-Rim-Misc-near-Vernon-BC-10041",
    "directions": "Travel to the gate & main parking lot for Kalamalka Lake Park. Walk through the gate and turn to your left and travel along the fence. After about 100 meters you have two choices. You can go left on the old trail or right on a new trail that has been constructed. The old trail dips down into a small valley and is a steep climb back up. The new trail is a gentle and steady climb and when you get to the intersection, turn left. If you go right, it takes you back to the road. Follow the trail and at the next intersection, go right along the fence. Follow the trail until you see the power line. The trail splits up in several loop backs for bikes but, if you travel up to under the power lines, you will see the trail split. The High Rim Trail is well marked and goes to the right. In a relative short short distance you will come to the intersection of the trail I have outlined in the above link. I think the repeater tower would be about 9.5-10km from this point.",
