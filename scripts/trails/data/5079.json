    "description": "16 kilometres! In the dark!\r\rNot really in the dark; there should be moon light, and from 3 o?clock, sun will be rising up.\r \r\u00a8La marche du solstice\u00a8 has become an annual event; on the Saturday night of the St-Jean- Baptiste weekend, a full school bus of trekkers lives the town of Fermont to get to the Mont-Severson parking lot. And from there starts the 16 km night adventure to walk the Mont-Severson trail back to the town.\r\rAn uncommon nature contemplation experience in all aspects:  the night, the smell, the morning, the taiga type vegetation, tundra type on the hill tops, the thickness of the lichen bed (like walking on a pillow), the almost full moon (lucky timing this year), the may be rain, the almost too much watered swamp, the still remaining snow patches, the not yet awaken mosquitoes, the mystic misty Brume Lake.\r\rI do not have the writing skill to transmit the true sense of the experience.\r\rThanks to the organisers.  Special thanks to the believers who made this happen at first.\r\rExperience it.\r\r",
    "directions": "The parking lot is located at km 361 on road 389 from Baie-Comeau to Fermont. You get back to Fermont via the trail",
