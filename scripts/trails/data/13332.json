    "description": "The road leading to this crag is horrible and the bushwack is moderate to hard.\u00a0 The usual satellite imagery in Google Earth doesn't show the potential but the orthoimages from the NS government shows a whopper of a wall with what even looks like a fissure running right in the middle of it. There are large cracks and my youtube video will show\u00a0this better.\u00a0 The bugs were defcon 5 level in May 2020.\u00a0 BTW I am standing at the top of the wall in most picture for scale.",
