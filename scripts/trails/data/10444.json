    "description": "Great long weekend trip. The route itself isn't overly popular, the lakes it crosses tend to be pretty busy during the summer and on weekends.\r\rThis route is ~55KM long and crosses 19 of Algonquin Parks lakes, rivers, creeks, and ponds. The only unfortunate aspect of this trip is the 6KM of portaging that takes place. The best parts of this trip would have to be the section of Madawaska river, Head Cr, as well as the Bonnechere and surrounding lakes. \r\rI rated this trip as moderate difficulty due to the number and total length of the portages. Smoke lake is known to be fairly windy. We ran this in 2 and a half days. 3 full days or 3 and a half days would have given us a little more time to enjoy the scenery.\r\rDay 1:\rSmoke Lake\rPortage\rKoochie Lake\rPortage \rLittle Island Lake\rPortage\rSheriff Pond\rPortage\rTanamakoon Lake\r\rDay 2:\rCache Lake\rPortage \rMadawaska River\rPortage\rMadawaska River\rHead Creek\rPortage\rHead Creek\rPortage\rHead Creek\rPortage\rHead Lake\rPortage\rHarness Lake\rPortage \rPardee lake\rPortage \rLawrence lake\r\rDay 3:\rPortage \rKirkwood Lake\rPortage\rPhipps Lake\rPortage\rBonnechere Lakes\rPortage\rCradle  Lake\rPortage\rBonnechere Lakes\rPortage \rBig Porcupine Lake\rPortage\rRagged Lake\rPortage\rSmoke Lake\r\r",
