    "description": "NTS Map:92B5.  A well-marked trail that starts on a logging road. 6km (one way) trip is uphill. Trail is flagged in blue marking tape, changing to red approximately half way. White blaze marks have been painted on tress at 20m intervals. Signage is also prominent. A great view waits at the end. The trail is also home to many native orchids (4 varieties found on our hike).",
    "directions": "Park near the Convenience store at French Beach (the one with the Eagles). Start following the logging road to the North.  Aprox 700m up the road, there is black drain pipe (about 1m in diametre). Here, 20m to the east is the woodland trail. Look for the blue flagging. The trail crosses the road again, but I recommend taking the trail.",
