    "description": "This trail follows the North Saskatchewan river loop 3.7 km from the parking area and back. There are connecting trails along the way, as well as trails on the other side of the river, connected by a foot bridge. This is an addition of another 2 to 5 km to add to your trek. A good trail to take the family, and is at least half covered with asphalt. There is need to be careful with children, as bikes are also on the trails, however, I have never encountered careless riders. There are opportunities to view and photograph wildlife, as well as beautiful landscapes. (see photos taken in the area)  You are also invited tovisit my website  www.claudeeclement.com. To further enhance your day, Fort Edmonton is located close by.The beauty of the trail area is, you can go for a few hours, or as long as you want.",
    "directions": "This trail is located in the city of Edmonton. From the White Mud  freeway, exit north on Fox Drive, turn left at the first set of traffic lights, Proceed to the parking lot and the trail head.",
