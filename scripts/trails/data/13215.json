    "description": "A brilliant day at Cox Bay near Tofino on the west coast of Vancouver Island. Sunny, windy and beautifully dry conditions for the short, somewhat steep hike up to Cox Bay Lookout, an unofficial trail just inside Pacific Rim National Park. A climb of 400 ft elev diff from high tide, just under 500m distance Great fun heading up at low tide to catch superb view of the west coast. Headed to Tofino afterwards for espresso and snacks.   The trail is a bit rooty in places and can be very muddy in wet season.  There are a few short steep sections",
    "directions": "Drive to Cox Bsy parking sewage south of Tofino BC.  Walk to the beach then turn south towards the obvious small summit. Best accessed at LOW tide.",
