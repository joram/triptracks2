    "description": "Starts from highway on old logging roads, then a dead end continues as an ATV trail.  A couple of boggy sections to cross (hike a bike) but otherwise reasonable trails to powerline.  Several streams to cross, but all have hard bottoms.  Be prepared to get wet feet.  A fun ride on a hot summer day.",
    "directions": "Start from just north of second exit to Grand Bay traveling from Saint John to Fredericton.  You can park at the exit or along the highway just north of the exit.  Watch for ATV trails on west side of highway leading to logging road and then at the end to an ATV trail.  Once at powerline, turn right (southeast) and in about 4km hit the highway again.  Go north beside highway using ATV trails until you come to a large culvert underneath the highway, cross under and follow logging roads south back to the start (second Grand Bay exit).  I will try to upload the GPS file...",
