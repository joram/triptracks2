    "description": "This is a relatively short hike to a series of unsuspected waterfalls by the side of highway 14 near Upper Vaughan.  Setting off from the highway I could hear the roar of the water so I was pretty excited!   About 100m from the road you reach the stream and then it is a straightforward hike up the stream to a unending series of small falls and cascades.  As you progress over the first couple of falls, you enter a majestic softwood forest.  What a beautiful site, the canopy is high overhead, moss covers everything below and the falls just keep coming and coming.",
    "directions": "Highway 14 to Upper Vaughan.  Park by the intersection of the highway and Lakeview crescent and head into the woods to the east of the highway and seek out the Smeltzer Brook.",
