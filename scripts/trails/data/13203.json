    "description": "Another exploration off the Gairloch Mountain Rd is on a tributary to MacKenzie Brook.  A nice logging road gets you very close to the brook.  The only thing I had was some sat imagery that looked promising.  I set forth into a logged area overgrown by prickly bushes but son was in a mature hardwood forest.  I followed the tributary and was soon rewarded by a series of fall at; N46.14625\u00b0 W61.00825\u00b0.Going further downstream you will some ore smaller falls until the largest of all of the falls on this brook at; N46.14879\u00b0 W61.00391\u00b0.  Here the tributary flows into the MacKenzie Brook and a nice rock wall can be seen across the brook. I followed the brook upstream for about 100ft to a smaller fall on the larger brook.  After I went up the hill and returned to my car via a super nice hardwood stand.Stats for the hike; 3.3km, 1hr7min, 980ft total elevation",
