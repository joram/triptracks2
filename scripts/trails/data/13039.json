    "description": "A pleasant and fairly easy hike from Whitehorse Creek near Cadomin to Miette Hotsprings in Jasper park. Some muddy sections and 3-4 river crossings, but definitely manageable for an average hiker.",
    "directions": "From Jasper to Miette Hot SpringsTake Highway 16 towards Hinton, and turn onto the Miette Road at PocahontasCabins (49 km from Jasper). It is 17 km from the turn off to the hot springs. In thehot springs parking lot, drive straight to the parking lot by the picnic area past theouthouse. The trailhead is straight ahead.From Jasper to Whitehorse CreekFrom Jasper take Highway 16 east towards Hinton, out of the park. After 70 kmfrom Jasper, turn right onto Highway 40 towards Cadomin. Drive 48 km to aT-junction on a highway that turns into gravel. Turn right towards Cadomin. Drive through the village (2.5 km), and another 6 km to the campground. After the village of Cadomin, the road becomes gravel again, but is passable by cars. The road now parallels a large haul road for the nearby Cheviot coalmine. Look for signs to the campground; the entrance road to the campground turns off from the through road on the left, and swings right through atunnel underneath the haul road. The trailhead is at the far end of the campground.",
