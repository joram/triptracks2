    "description": "Edwards Rating: IV (V) M MElevation of 794 m NET, 1002 m TOT & max 2634 m6 to 9 hoursThis is an incredible and challenging scramble with a lot of hands-on scrambling but high risk of rock falls. WEAR AN HELMET and hope to be the only group scrambling up there as you will receive scree and some bigger rocks for sure. My girlfriend and I were alone the two times we visited The Fist fortunately. We left late in the day the first time and lacked some courage to complete our ascent and completed it a week later with no problem at all, starting soon enough to be alone again. There are a lot of bears activity as well (dug up stumps, dens, feces), you should keep talking and shout once in a while.The approach is extremely easy and straightforward but make sure you keep right on the logging road when it splits after about 3 km. Then, you will get to Commonwealth creek in 5 to 10 minutes and keep going along its right on the obvious but narrower and bushy trail. Once in the valley, keep going on that trail for a few minutes looking to your right for an avalanche gully leading to the col of The Fist on your right and Mount Smuts on your left. Take the last gully before the forest lying down Smuts, it is the best option even though not very good. Expect to do some very hard bushwhacking if you don?t use that last gully and keep up in or close to it all the way to the col. On my GPS track, the farthest trail in the valley is the longest but best option.Once at the col, go right to the base of The Fist summit block. Take your time to assess the trail you want to use. We preferred the one on the left side of a big freestanding rock fin. Expect good hands-on scrambling, 3-4 climbing moves, rock falls almost all the time and great exposure on the last section leading to the summit. Make your way up into that gully staying left when possible to get to the skyline. Once at that point, you will scramble up the wall to the left with great holds but also impressive exposure to your right. Once past this, you will find 2-3 different scramble routes leading to your summit not so far away. You need some route finding skills to complete that scramble section in the summit block, this is not an easy scramble but very interesting one!",
