    "description": "This is a description of a small hike I did to see some falls on Keys Brook.  However I noticed that there were many trails in this area suitable to explore by foot or mtn bike.\r\rAs you see the river in front of you, there is a small trail that begins on the right that leads you into an evergreen forest but away from the river.  I noticed a faint trail that took me from this trail back to the rivers edge and then downstream to two sets of falls.  The falls aren?t very big but it doesn?t take very long to reach tem either.\r\rThe forest is quite nice in there with some very large mature evergreen trees.  There are also a couple of boulders but I did not see any that would be suitable for bouldering except maybe for some around the falls. This is an area I will go back to and explore.  It?s really close to the city and looks like there are a lot of trails.\r",
