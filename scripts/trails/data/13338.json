    "description": "A nice but small waterfall perfect for swimming lies in an area of the eastern shore where waterfalls may be far and few to explore.  This one also has a trail right to it.  Funny story is that I didn\u2019t see the trail at first and did some very horrible bushwacking to get to the fall.  Upon reaching it, I saw the end of the trail leading back to my car!",
    "directions": "Highway 7 between Sheet Hbr and Sherbrooke.  In Port Dufferin ,before crossing the bridge over Salmon River take a slight left turn on the old road leading to the area where the bridge used to be.  Park and find the atv trail leading to the north located about 100m from the river.",
