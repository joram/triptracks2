    "description": "Completed on Sep 5, 2020 in dry conditions\n// Edwards Rating: II (III) M M\n// 6 to 10 hours\n// Elevation of 1151 m NET, 1313 m TOT & max 2996 m\n// Gear: Poles. A helmet would have been a good idea (debris, walking along cliff bands). Despite the warm weather, wind gusts were strong and it was cold at times.\n*****\nThis is a moderate scramble and can easily become difficult and exposed when you explore the gullies and try scrambling up and around the pinnacles and rock bands. Views are exceptional and we thought it was a good idea to traverse it from Noseeum Creek back to Hector Creek as advised by Vern in his trip report on Explor8tion. Not an obvious trail for the most part, so I wouldn\u2019t recommend it to new and inexperienced scramblers.\n// Starting from Hector Creek\u2019s parking lot, we walked up north on the highway and reached Noseeum Creek parking lot for 2.3 km. - You should consider an opening at 2.1 km where you\u2019ll see the actual gully we ended up using to reach the ridge -. We took the trail on the right side of the creek and kept going until we saw the beginning of the ridge. We gained elevation going right and went along pinnacles and rock or cliff bands for a while, trying a few gullies that were too steep and dangerous for us today. We ended up sidesloping until we passed piles of huge boulders in an opened gully where we could easily reach the first part of the ridge. From there, we could see the beginner of the summit ridge to the right so we went in that direction and scrambled up rubble and more rubble to get there. We turned right when we reached the glacier and scrambled directly on the ridge, avoiding a couple of sections to the left along the glacier. Just before the summit, we had to go right to find a crack we used to complete our ascent. Drops on the right are impressive so we stayed on top or left for that reason. Views of surrounding glaciers and lakes are worth all the trouble & rubble!\n// Going down, we followed the east ridge to go down and back up to the false summit using snow patches where possible, being mindful of the glacier to the left. We kept hiking a few minutes passed the big cairn and turned right to use 4 nice snow patches to glissade down this section. Then, we followed cairns in the grey rubble to go down some more and find the scree gully breaking one of the many cliff bands in this beautiful valley. We turned right in the green valley and kept going until we got cliffed out. We followed the first wall to the right and reached a good trail there. We did the same for the second cliff and the waterfall. Once at the bottom of the waterfall, there\u2019s a couple of trails at some point but it seems like both bring you back to the parking lot.",
    "directions": "From Lake Louise, continue onto Trans-Canada Hwy for about 2.3 km and take the Alberta 93 exit toward Jasper. Continue for approx. 20 km and park at the roadside pullout on your left at Hector Creek. Walk down the 93 North for 2.3 km to Noseeum  Creek parking lot.",
