    "description": "I don't get to see many new waterfalls in the Annapolis valley but this is one of them.  The hunch was the sat imagery showing a weird outcrop by the brook about 1 km upstream.  Usually rocky outcrops = fun and/or falls.  Setting off from Shore Rd, walk along the brook for 1 km...don't worry it's boring but perseverance pays off!  After that distance the walls enclose on you and you enter a mini canyon.  In winter it's full of ice and summer would be a great time to explore the climbing potential.  The falls aren't the tallest around at about  10 ft for two of them but the canyon is special.  there is an extra fall a few hundred feet after the gorge finishes.",
