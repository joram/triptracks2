    "description": "This is a beautiful area with plenty of waterfalls, long hills and good single track.\r\rSome double track, single track and a rail trail link that goes all the way up to Cambridge to the north and Hamilton to the south. There are some long climbs with some steep sections. I've seen lots of deer in here on almost every ride. There are a few nice waterfalls although some are hidden and you need to know how to get to them.  The trail can be busy with hikers and horses so yield accordingly.",
    "directions": "Park at the Dundas Conservation area 3.5 kilometers west of downtown Ancaster on Governors Rd. There is a fee but there is a lot trails to access here.",
