    "description": "Trail will follow logging roads to within 150 m of the summit of the Matterhorn. This track does require a 75 m high bushwhack along a trail from one logging road to another. The rest of the trail is completely on logging trails on the way up., At the top you will leave the logging road to follow the trail to the summit. The trip took us 2.5 hours to the top including stopping for lunch and 1.5 hours to come back down.",
    "directions": "The trailhead is at the store near French Beach. The current business is a pizza business. You can park at this location and proceed through the yellow logging gate.",
