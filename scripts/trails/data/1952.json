    "description": "In Wells Grey Provincial Park, Lakeshore/Chain Meadows trail begins at the Clearwater Lake campsite.  This hike is an average hike that travels about 5km along the lakeshore of Clearwater Lake.  You climb to a viewpoint of the lake and mountains.  The last remaining major part of this trail is in the temperate forest.  Be sure to carry plenty of insect repellent.  Near the end of the trail, there is a lookout to view Osprey Falls and the Clearwater Lake campsite before you begin the steep decent down to the campsite.  You may do this hike in reverse order, as it is a loop.  The trail takes you through BC's lush interior temperate forests, historic volcanic features, and amazing scenic views.  Be sure to review the rules for staying and hiking in the park.",
    "directions": "At Clearwater BC, Turn left off Hwy 5 (Yellow-Head) at the visitors' info center.  Travel about 54km into Wells Grey Provincial Park.
