    "description": "The 5km trail is an easy hike along the waterfront of New Denver. On the southern end of the trail I looped back via Josephine St and passed the Nikkei Internment  Memorial Center. This end of the trail also passes a marina, Day/ camping and ball park and Japanese Gardens.\nThe Nikkei Internment Memorial Centre (NIMC) in New Denver is the only interpretive centre in Canada dedicated to the history of the uprooting and internment of over 22,000 Canadians of Japanese heritage. The centre, in New Denver, British Columbia, is situated on one of ten Canadian internment camp sites, which were located in the interior of BC during the Second World War.\nTips:\nThe North end of the trail is the Mori Lakeside Trail. Please note that on Dec 5, 2010 the section  between 6th Ave and Bellevue Ave was closed due to public vandalism and destruction of trees. If closed the southern part of the Mori Trail can be accessed by following Bellevue Ave. to the stairway with a clearly marked Mori Trail Sign on Bellevue Ave. The Mori trail continues past the gps marked trail but I had run out of time so had to turn back.",
    "directions": "Almost any road leading to the lake shore in New Denver will provide access to the trail. I parked at the end of 6th Ave which is the main street leading into New Denver off Highway 6",
