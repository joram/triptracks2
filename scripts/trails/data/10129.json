    "description": "A moderate downhill mountain biking trail fit for all levels of experience. Serves as the Sunshine Coaster DH course, formerly the Rat Race, at the start of the DH season.\rDropping in from the start of the trail this trail is smooth with numerous bermed corners. As it enters back into the trees expect the occasional root or rock but nothing major. There are a few small drops and jumps but nothing large, ride arounds do exist for all technical features.",
    "directions": "Drive up the logging road for a couple of Kilometers until you come to a pull-out/parking area large enough to fit a few vehicles. At this point you can enter a double track trail that will take you down to the start of the course. Follow this double track along until it hits a gate and continue riding down into the trees for a few minutes until it hits the start of Mach Chicken.",
