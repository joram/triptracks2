    "description": "As the name suggest this place has a waterfall.  Most people see it from the top trail but if you follow my tracks  you can witness this great fall from the bottom and go hide behind it!From the parking lot head for the hardwood forest and follow the lip of the escarpment till you come to a sharp corner which as a medium grade slope.  Get down the slope and head upstream to the waterfall.  Once there, you can easily get behind the curtain of water or ice in my case.  The fall must ba about 35m so it?s a great spot no doubt for some ice climbing.",
    "directions": "Mud St to Paramont St and then turn right on Ackland St and find the Felkers Fall parking lot",
