    "directions": "From the Lake Louise townsite you will want to head to Lake Moraine. Once you get off Highway town you just head straight through the town. About 2km past the stop sign at the beginning of town you will come to the turn off for Lake Moraine, make a left here. If you miss it and head straight, you will end up at Lake Louise. Parking is available at the Lake Moraine parking lot if your early enough or lucky. Not uncommon to have the road leading up to the lake be lined with vehicles parking.Once you have found parking you will want to head towards the lake shore. Head left over the huge rock pile and follow the trail to Consolation Lakes.After a few minutes you will come across the large slope of rock and rubble. There are many paths here, some look better than others. Eventually they all converge and your target is the gully in-between the two large cliffs.On your way up you will come across a mini 'cave' on the right hand side which has a little walkway leading up to it.Once you get the summit you can enjoy the amazing view. The summit offers a uninhibited view of Mount Temple and Lake Moraine below. You can also see the Consolation Lakes which saves you from having to hike out there too see the green pools. Another bonus is the couch, table, and TV! Some folks clearly had WAY too much time available and actually put together large pieces of rock that look perfectly like a couch, a nice coffee table, and a TV. There are even wooden sticks sticking out the top to look like antennas.",
