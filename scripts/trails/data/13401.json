    "description": "I usually post about under explored or unknown places in nova Scotia.  that being said, sometimes I do go hiking in well known local spots.  this is one of them.  Crystal cliifs are a series of gypsum cliffs set in the gulf of St Lawrence near Antigonish.  The hike starts on a well travelled gravel path, takes a wooden bridge over a small estuary and reach a decent looking beach.  Once at the beach go to the right towards the cliffs.  Soon you will start to see these outcrops of white rocks (gypsum).  if you time yourself with a low tide or don't mind getting wet there are some sea caves to the north of those cliffs.  In the summer it is not unusual to see some boats parked close by and rubber dinghies hanging close to the cave entrance.",
