    "description": "Startig at the parking spot on the Lac Le jeune road ( just past the truck scales) you climb up a forestry road to the fence. You keep to the fence to your right for a around 200m and then get to a clear cross point in the fence. Dont cross the fence but turn right onto the gravel road and this will take you to a clear single track. Unfortunately there is no markers as all of this is on private land. Take the Gps map with you. Follow the single track till there is a 180 degree turn to your right around a stump. Take this trail. From here you will be able to do three different trails. First to the left is MINE Too and MINE. When you reach the bottom, Climb back up the road mention before. Next round you continue straight towards STUBBY a fun Cross country descent. For your third loop there is a challenge in the more technical SHEPHERDS Trail. Use the GPS for getting to the different trail heads Or even Better .... RIDE it with a local!",
