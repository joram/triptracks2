    "description": "One of the top trails at Rainier National Park. You'll hike through a variety of terrain ranging from sweetly scented meadows with wildflower displays to snowfields and the rubble of glaciers.The hike to Panorama Point via the Skyline Trail starts out on stone steps near the Visitor Center and climbs briefly uphill to a series of trail junctions. Turn right at the main junction; follow the signs to Panorama Point on the Skyline Trail. This main trail also provides access to Alta Vista, the Glacier Vista trail and other Paradise \"flower\" trails or viewpoints.Our hike to Panorama Point fell on what we affectionately call a \"transitional\" day; where fog and clouds gradually give way to sun (or sadly, vice versa). En route we enjoyed graceful groves of subalpine trees placed in meadows sparkling with avalanche lilies and bright patches of pink heather. In late July, Western pasque flowers were in transition some still blooming, others gone to seed. Rosy spirea, lupine and bright yellow cinquefoil added splashes of color to the green meadows.In mid-July we found snow patches at higher elevations where park rangers had marked a safe route across the snow. We had planned to hike the Lower Skyline Trail back to Paradise. Instead, we found the Lower Skyline closed due to snow and ice; hikers were directed to take the High Skyline Trail instead.The persistent fog began to lift as we approached Panorama Point; Mount Rainier materialized slowly through the mist. Crevasses and rocks on the flanks of Rainier appeared and dissolved again as mist teasingly rolled back and forth across the skyline.We reached Panorama Point (6,227 feet). Turning away from Rainier the peaks of the Tatoosh range poked through like islands in a sea of clouds.The High Skyline continues, climbing above Panorama Point to a high point (N 46\u00b0 48' 20\", W 121\u00b0 43' 39\"; elevation 7,051 feet) where you can look down on the Point. At Panorama Point there are options: hike back the way you came or extend your hike by making a loop as we did.We continued on the High Skyline Trail as the trail dropped down to the moonscape rubble of an ancient moraine interspersed with snow patches. As we descended the world of rock and snow gradually gave way to tender meadows and moss-bordered rivulets.When you get to the junction (N 46\u00b0 47' 56\", W 121\u00b0 43' 22\"; elevation 6,400 feet) for the Golden Gate trail, there are more options. For a shorter route follow the Golden Gate trail through Edith Basin back to Paradise. You can also continue on the Skyline Trail; this adds about a mile to your hike. The Skyline trail drops down to the Stevens Van Trump Memorial, continuing to Myrtle Falls (5,600 feet) before it descends to Paradise. Mileages are displayed on trail markers to help you decide which route you want to take.As we approached Paradise the meadows blazed with magenta paintbrush, bistort, Jacobs ladder, lousewort, valerian and cinquefoil. Marmots posted on sentry rocks shrilled warnings before scuttling out of sight as we passed.About \u00bd mile from Paradise we crossed Myrtle Creek on a bridge; here you can also drop down to a dramatic viewpoint of Myrtle Falls, a favorite spot of professional photographers.All too soon we left the trail and stepped into the parking lot, feeling slightly dazed as if we had just been awakened from a dream.- Karen Sykes, Visit Rainier Hiking Expert",
