    "description": "These falls are a bin unexpected as most topographic maps of this area do not even show a stream here.  But those same topo maps show a lot of elevation loss all at once and some kind of through that would carry water.  I wanted the shortest route to my waypoint.  I used an old woods road that is still passable by car as of 2020.  When it branched off, to the right.  I left my car and continued on the left path.  It gets narrower at this point anyways...more of an ate size path.\n\n\nI spotted some old logging roads on sat imagery and was able to actually find it through some alder patches.  Once the alder ends, the path is better defined and quite easy to follow.  I left it once it became very faint and hard to follow AND my GPS was pointing away from it towards the fall.\n\nA small 200m walk or so bushwack in an open forest led me to the unnamed brook and the topmost fall.  Its like a cascade.  About 100m downstream of it, the stream make a surprisingly tall waterfall set amongst a beautiful hemlock stand.  There is not a lot of water in this brook so only go in spring or after a heavy rainfall",
