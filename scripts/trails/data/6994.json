    "description": "Time and distance are for a return trip on this 4km loop. Elevation gain is about 100m (330').\r\rBurnt over 50 years ago, this trail attracts a variety of birds and animals to the young forest. Watch for dead trees covered in lichen known locally as 'dead man's beard' (in Alberta it's called 'witches hair'). On the downside of the loop, the burnt area is more obvious, with large areas of ferns, which I thought was quite out of place.\r\rThe trail starts out as a wide (weed whacked) route through alders but narrows (or seems to) as you enter the forest. You won't encounter this alder super-trail until the other end. Once in the forest you are in nice cool coniferous trees until the downside. \r\rAt about the midpoint of the loop there is a 140 stair side trail to a lookout. This amy seem like a lot of stairs but take your time and do it, the views are worth every step.",
