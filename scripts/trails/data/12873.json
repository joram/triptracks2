    "description": "This is a good hike for a rainy day or if you are in the area and want a day in the forest. I started this in Arroyo park where its free to park but limited parking. If you park at Larrabee state park it will cost you a day pass. Makes for a bit longer. I did a loop, mostly in forest to a viewpoint so not great payoff for the length but like i said good for a rainy day or off season when you are dying to get out there.",
    "directions": "Take exit 250 off I-5 at bellingham. Going West on old fairhaven parkway turn left almost right away on 30th street and follow all the way to Old samish rd and turn right. Parking is on the left very soon along the road.",
