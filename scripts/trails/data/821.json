    "description": "NTS Map:92C8.  The 2km trail from China beach trailhead of the Juan De Fuca Marine Trail to Mystic beach provides a good taste of what it would be like to hike the longer more rugged West coast trail.  This was a return day trip for me having first discovered the trail several years ago before the Marine Trail was completed.You get a variety of trail--heavy rooted single track; old skid road; and a long drop down to the beach along a felled and notched tree. Once at the beach be sure to go east, or left, and walk along the beach to a hanging waterfall.  On my last visit the sea was quite wild and the breakers were very impressive.  One can camp at the beach but there is a charge for both camping and parking.  The Peter Wolfe Creek suspension bridge is a highlight of this section.  You can continue west along the Marine trail all the way to Botany Bay at Port Renfrew some 47 kms away.  This is one of four access points to the Marine Trail from the West Coast Road.",
    "directions": "Head west from Victoria along Highway 14 past Sooke and Jordan River until you see the Juan De Fuca Marine Trail - China Creek trailhead.  This is shortly after the campsite turnoff.  Pay your parking fee and head out for a nice walk down to the beach.  There is a separate walk down to China beach from the same access point that is detailed elsewhere in Trailpeak.",
