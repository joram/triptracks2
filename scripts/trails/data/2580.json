    "description": "NTS Map:92F8.  The notch, the little hill on the north side of Nanoose Harbour, is where this hikewalk takes you.  From the parking area head up the trail.  When you get to two large concrete water reservoirs follow the trail to the left.  In a few minutes you will come to a fork in the trail, head right up a bit of a steep trail to the top of the notch.  If you head left, you will come to the lower look out.  From the top you will see views of Mt. Arrowsmith, Nanoose Harbour and south to Nanaimo.  The entire hike should take 30-60 minutes.  Another nice thing about the hike is that you are walking in a Gary Oak ecosystem.  Also from the top, if you are lucky, you may see Navy ships in the Harbour because of CFB Fairwinds.",
    "directions": "To get to the notch head to Nanoose and make a right or left at the petro Canada gas station on Northwest Bay road.  Just past the E&N railway tracks, make a right on Powderpoint road.  After about 3.5 kms you will see the trailhead on your right.",
