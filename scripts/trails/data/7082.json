    "description": "Easy little trail which starts at the parking Lot for Devonian Park in Metchosin. Hikers will take marked paths to the beach and then follow the beck to the southwest. This is a cobble beach for this section and pretty easy to walk on but good shoes are always great. The path will take you though the \"backyard\" of a property owner but it is below the high tide line so it is public land and many people cross. You can follow the trail along the coast even further than the GPS track if you wish. The route in was 1.5 km as per the GPS track but I expect that it is possible to continue for another 500 m or so.",
    "directions": "Follow the Trans-Canada Highway from Victoria, and take the Colwood exit. Follow the Old Island Highway, which turns into Sooke Road. From Sooke Road, turn left on Metchosin Road, which turns into William Head Road at the Happy Valley Road junction. Follow William Head Road to the park entrance on the left. Allow approximately 40 minutes driving time from Victoria. Take the trail to the right by the pit toilets to walk along Sherwood Creek.",
