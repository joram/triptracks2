    "description": "This is a nice walk among grasslands, trees, and over wooden bridges/boardwalks.  This trip includes a walk around Little River Bowl which is the old Langley Speedway.  The section of the trail that leads to the speedway can get quite muddy if it has been raining recently.  Often see  people along the trail feeding chickadees out of their hands.",
    "directions": "On the south side of 16th avenue just east of 200th street in South Langley. See map right.",
