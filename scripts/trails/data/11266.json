    "description": "This is a really short hike to a some sort of a gorge with numerous waterfalls.  It is not very long but it makes it up in beauty.  The area around the cliffs have these large pine trees and two of the falla are a good 10ft or more in drop.  There is a couple of pools to go swimming in as well.",
    "directions": "Highway 104.  Take Sutherlands River exit and take the Thorburn Rd.  Turn left on Park Falls Rd (or Sutherlands River Rd depending on atlas).  the falls are located where the Sutherland River flows under the road",
