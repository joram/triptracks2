    "description": "Yer average average-easy type MTB trail.  Close to town.  Got a few cows for company, a little bit 'o mud, some asphalt, a multitude of options to make it longer or shorter and some of the most quiet, scenic trails you can hope for. Well usually quiet, although I did run into (nearly literally) a person who apparently thought it was normal to drive/bike on the left side of the road when passing other people.From the pond, follow the paths NE (beside Iron Creek).  At the 3.9km mark you can choose to go CW or CCW.  If going CCW, eventually you pop out on the paved Elk Valley Road.  Go 1.6km north, 1.6km west, then back onto the West Bragg Creek XC trails.  Come SSE on the trails and you will pick up Iron Creek again on your left (or right if you took another trail) and follow it back to re-join your out-bound trail.  There are a TON of options, side trails/loops (Fullerton for example) to make your day as long or short as you want.NTS Map: 082J15Elevation Gain: 570 m (1,871 ft).",
    "directions": "South Calgary, go west on hiway 22X (turns into 66), go 8km past 2nd Bragg Creek turn-off to Allan Bill Pond parking lot.  Trail leaves east end of lot, goes under hiway 66.",
