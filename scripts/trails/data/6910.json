    "description": "An EPIC long, scenic, and amazingly great ride with a brutal, unrideable climb up Rickert's Pass.  The tracklog elevation plot looks like hitting a wall.  500m up in only 2.5km of loose, rocky, mountain goat territory.  33km in length with nearly 1000m of cumulative climbing.\r\nFrom the start, there is a serious but shortish climb up to Elbow Lake, a very scenic lake / area worth a trip just for itself.  Then skirt the West edge of the lake on the trail and off you go.\r\nAfter a while you end up on the Sheep Trail, a nice, doubletrack, gravel fire road with numerous creek crossings (very nice on a hot day).  You will find a early 1900's cowboy cabin after a few km, stop for lunch there.\r\nDo a gel proactively, you'll need it REAL soon.\r\nThen ride another 2.4km SE and look for a broken down sign indicating the Tee to the South and the start of Rickert's Pass.\r\nStart pushing for 1.5 hours.  YES, 90 minutes.  But the views are amazing when you get up there, and the downhill on the S side of the pass is TOTALLY worth it.  Technical, fast, rooty, will pound your bike.  but it is virtually all DH to the parking lot where your shuttle and beer are waiting.  \r\nWait?? you didn't pack a few cold ones?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r",
    "directions": "\r\nWest of Calgary on Hiway 1 to Hiway 40 (Kananaskis Trail).  Drive 75.5km S of Hiway 1 on #40 to the Elbow Lake trailhead.  Drop bikes there.  \r\nShuttle a car or two to the south end, drive 21.8km further South on #40 to the Mist Creek trailhead.\r\nDrive back to N end and start riding South from there.",
