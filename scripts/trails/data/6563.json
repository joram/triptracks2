    "description": "This is a description on how to find three waterfalls on Sherlock Brook. All the falls I found were downstream of where the road intersects the stream. I ended waking upstream for a bit but did not find any other falls (see GPS track). The walk down the brook is through a fairly nice forested area composed mostly of evergreen. At the base of the biggest waterfall is a pool that would be good to swim in and there is a lot of space too near the biggest waterfall to camp. This road is probably not plowed in the winter. I wonder if you could get some maple syrup at the production facility that you will see on your way to the falls.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nUpdate May 2020; there is now a nice trail along the brook and the falls.\u00a0 Trailhead has a little flag on the right of the road about 200m before you get to the bridge.\u00a0 And some information from a Dwight S. via facebook (Thanks!);\u00a0Just down stream from the falls where where it turns 90 degrees to the left there is a natural sluice. At the bottom of the sluice there was a grist mill in the late 1800's early 1900's.\r\n\r",
    "directions": "\r\n\r\nTake highway 224 to upper Musquodoboit. Before getting to town turn right on Cariboo Rd and drive to a T intersection 800m down the road. Turn left on Deckman Rd and drive 1.25km to dirt road on right. Turn right and drive 1.8km to bridge over brook. Head downstream to couple sets of falls",
