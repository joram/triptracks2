    "description": "Lake Maxwell is located in a cirque above timberline in the Eagle Cap Wilderness of North-eastern Oregon.  The hike starts at Shady Campground and climbs steeply up the east-facing slope.  The trail switches back five or six times before heading up into the hanging valley at about timberline.  We hiked in and out in about 8 hours with our nine-year-old daughter.  Great trail and a beautiful lake. There is GPS data attached to this trail (see \"download GPS\"), which if loaded into your GPS can help you find route points.",
    "directions": "From La Grande, Oregon, take highway 82 to the town of Lostine.  In Lostine, highway 82 takes a right angle bend to the east.  At this corner you want to continue south onto the Lostine River Road.  Shady Campground is about 17.5 miles from the town of Lostine.",
