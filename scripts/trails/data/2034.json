    "description": "If you want to see any type of the wildlife that northern Ontario has to offer I would suggest this as the trail to check out.  Lots of ups and downs.  You're not rewarded with any really senic vistas yet have an excellent chance of running into a moose or a black bear.  Camp sites are in fantastic shape and are also very picturesque.Susan Lake located in the second loop does offer some magnificant views and should not be overlooked.  If you ever really want to feel like you're getting away from it all then this is the trail for you.  Fall weekends can get busy!",
    "directions": "Three hours North of Toronto  in Algonquin Park.  You can access the trail from either highway 60 (km 3) or Rain Lake Road access.",
