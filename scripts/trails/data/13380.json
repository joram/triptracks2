    "description": "This is a short exploration to an old iron ore mining adit located on the bank of Drug Brook.   An adit is like a tunnel so it\u2019s easier to get in and out in comparison to a shaft which is strictly vertical.  Still, you need to be careful about entering any old mine workings as you never know how fragile the workings could be.  The adit is called Cullen\u2019s Level.\n\nThe logging road is in decent shape and you can drive to an area where a secondary road start on the right at about N45.40192\u00b0 W62.70890\u00b0. Walk this road to a clearing and then take the atv size path on the left.  Walk about 300m.  At this point, bushwack on your right to Drug Brook.  The adit is on the opposite side of the stream sitting about 4m high on the embankment at approx.; N45.40170\u00b0 W62.70189\u00b0.",
    "directions": "Highway 374 south of New Glasgow.  Turn right on Lorne Station road.  Turn left on Glengarry Rd.  turn left on MacQuarrie Loop and drive as far as you can.",
