    "description": "Close to Mount Cheam, Mount McGuire is a pretty steep trek from the trailhead that takes you past a small water way up towards a breathtaking view over the fraser valley.",
    "directions": "This summit of the Chilliwack Valley is located between Slesse and Tamihi Creeks and dominates the view south from downtown Chilliwack. The standard route from Borden Creek is a nice hike, while the north and northwest ridges are apparently a good snow climb and scramble respectively. This peak is unusual for its vicinity in that it is composed almost entirely of limestone, a rarity for SW BC.",
