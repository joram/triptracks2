    "description": "A long loop trail that circles the the perimeter of Pembina Valley Provincial Park.  There are a few creek crossings, but lots of rocks to cross on without getting your feet wet.  In general it is a moderate hike, with a few steep hills, and nice views of the pembina river valley area.",
    "directions": "From Winnipeg:  Go South West on Highway #3 (from the southwest corner of the perimeter highway) to Carmen, MB.  Go south on #3 to Morden/Winkler.  Go west on #3 to Highway #31.  Turn south on Highway #31 to Provincial Road #201.  Turn East on Provincial Road #201 and follow the signs to the park.",
