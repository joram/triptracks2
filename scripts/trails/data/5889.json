    "description": "Baby Steps is mostly an in-and-out to a loop along side Arches National Park. It has a variety of terrain and is an intermediate trip. About 200 meters of climbing along a rolling trail.\nIt starts out on the Klondike Bluffs trail and can be combined with it as well.  It's a great little trail and shouldn't be missed if you're in the area.",
    "directions": "Drive about 22.4 km North of Lions Park (Highway 128 corner) at the North end of Moab. Turn right (East) and drive just under 1km to a well marked trailhead. You can stop earlier and ride the road to make a longer trip.",
