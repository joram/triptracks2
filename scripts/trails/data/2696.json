    "description": "NTS Map: 083H12This multi-purpose recreation area borders the North side of Big Lake, a.k.a. Lois Hole Centennial Provincial Park named after a St. Albert icon (and ex-Lieutenant Governor).Section 26 is the LSD of the park, not some secret designation.  Among it's multi-users is Ducks Unlimited SO WEAR RED.  It will also be known as the ride I got the first flat on my new Giant.Simple and flat but interesting and some up close and personal views of Alberta's famous oil biz.  Many turns & twists to take so you can make this much longer of you want.  Could be wet as it winds through some marshland.",
    "directions": "From St. Albert Trail, take Mission Avenue West until you get to Meadowview Drive (at the old elevators).  Cross the tracks and drive 7.2km and turn left (south).  There is a small parking area at the DU sign.",
