    "description": "Take the Sir Donald Trail to the junction above Vaux Glacier Creek crossing.  Follow the fork to the right through sub alpine forest, leading you to switchbacks across the meadows. You will see Perley Rock, a lower knoll, which is approached from the steep slopes on the left side of the knoll. Take the trail to the summit for great views.  The summit is at 2150m. Stay off the glacier unless you have special equipment and appropriate training. There is GPS data attached to this trail (see \"download GPS\"), which if loaded into your GPS can help you find route points.\r\n\r\n \r\n In winter please check the \nAvaluator",
