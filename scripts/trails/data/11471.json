    "description": "From Evelyn Creek to Little Shovel Pass you'll be working the legs as the trail makes the first climb of the trip. With heavy demand on Snowbowl c/g by the two night crew, Little Shovel or Curator campgrounds are a good second choice for the first night out. From Little Shovel c/g the trail enters the more open terrain of the upper subalpine and continues its climb to Little Shovel Pass at 10km. Entering the Snowbowl the trail can be seen snaking its way down through open meadows and into the trees where Snowbowl c/g is hidden.",
    "directions": "drive east on Hwy 16 for 2km and turn right on the Maligne Lake Road. Cross the bridge, veer left and follow the Maligne Lake Road for 8 km to the northern parking lot on the right side of the road.",
