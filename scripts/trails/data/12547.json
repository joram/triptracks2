    "description": "Only 2  km beyond Citadel Pass, this tiresome pass affords good opportunities for a circle route back to Banff via Sundance!I guarantee... no one will be at that beautiful lake if you choose to camp there.This might be a GPS route that is worth dowloading... the trail is not very distinct. I have done the whole loop on horseback many years ago, and as such, it is fabulous.Looking forward to hearing how it works for you!",
    "directions": "Start at Sunshine Ski Village, west of Banff",
