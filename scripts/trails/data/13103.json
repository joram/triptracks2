    "description": "One last adventure/ exploration to do near the abandoned landing strip.   Drive NE on it and park at its end.  A logging road begins here.  Walk about 250m.  Then turn left and follow a small stream which is running to the north.  After 550m of following the stream, it goes down a gentle slope and joins a larger brook.  Follow the larger brook 300m downstream.  Here a first slider type fall is located and then a second fall can be reached by following the contour of the land to its base.  Total height of the multiple tiers is about 70ft with tallest fall in there at about 25ft.  the setting is gorgeous with mature hardwoods all around and the slope isn?t crazy steep like the other hikes nearby.BTW the brook is unnamed so I took the Little Barren feature located close by to name it.",
