    "description": "This had been on my to-do list for a while.  The small cave by the river was described on a map in the early 1900?s.  I set off from the dirt road into a logged area trying to follow a skidder track.  After 200m the logged area stop and you will enter a conifer forest.  There is a deep layer of moss and all in all it?s quite easy to walk towards the river.  At the river?s edge, it can be steep so carefully make your way down to the river.  About 500m upstream of the cave lies a couple of smaller waterfalls (pictures attached).  The cave itself is about 25ft deep and is carved by the high water at the spring freshet.  At all other times, it is dry to enter and dry inside as well.  It is narrow to enter but then opens a bit so you can stand.",
