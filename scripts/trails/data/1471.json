    "description": "From the traihead, walk on Fountain Flats Drive.  In about 1.5 km, the Fair Falls Trails turns left off the road.  The trail is easy to follow as it goes through a burnt forest.  Just 400 meters from the water fall, there are two geothermal wonders you should see.  It is the Imperial Geyser and Spray Geyser.  Simply follow the trail sign for the Geyser and you will see them.",
    "directions": "Drive 8 km south of Madison Junction and park into the parking lot on the west side of the road, south of the Grand Prismatic Spring.",
