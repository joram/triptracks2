    "description": "I was driving back towards Middleton from the South Mountains and saw a sign for the old mill hiking trail.  I had never heard of this trail so I decided to have a look.  The trail is set in a mixed forest and has two loops that go from the parking towards the Annapolis River.   i searched and searched for an old mill site but the Annapolis river is super flat in this area and it old have been hard to get any type of head pond going there.   There were no signs of grinding stones or building either.  the signing did not help explain where the mill would have been either.  Luckily we spotted some municipal employees in the parking lot.   We asked them about the origin of the name but unfortunately they were as dumfounded as us.  Nevertheless, the trail is wide and packed so it makes for a very easy walk in the woods.  The trail is not very long so its more a good picnic area than a hiking destination.",
    "directions": "Highway 1 near Wilmot.  Turn on the old mill rd and then turn left on Adam Rd and continue until the parking on your left.",
