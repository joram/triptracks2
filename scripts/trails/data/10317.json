    "description": "Time and distance are for a return trip. This trail is at the northeast edge of Straitsview, NL, about 20km NE of St. Anthony. \nThe Appalachian Mountains stretch from Georgia, USA to the end of the Great Northern Peninsula in Newfoundland. Until recently, the Appalachian Trail (AT) was only maintained from Georgia to northern Maine. It has since been extended into New Brunswick, Quebec and Newfoundland. Cape Raven (and Crow Head) are considered to be the northern terminusof the AT. The trail is still a work in progress in Canada, but will soon form a continuous, unbroken (except for that water hazard - the Atlantic) trail, which is now referred to as the International Appalachian Trail (IATN).\nThis is an easy to moderate, well maintained, short trail to a great lookout. At the lookout, there are 2 signs explaing the AT and Crow Head and Cape Raven, where Capt. James Cook is said to have once stood. The condition of the signs is testament to the winds that can blow around this area. So dress accordingly.\nThis is the northern end of Iceberg Alley as well, so you might get lucky in July or August with an icy show.",
    "directions": "The trailhead is right on the edge of Straitsview on Newfoundland Rt. 436, clearly visible from the highway.",
