    "description": "Forks Campground in Peter Lougheed Provincial Park is a very nice backcountry campground that serves as a great basecamp for exploring destinations such as Three Isle Lake and Turbine Canyon.  It is a smooth easy trail with such a gradual elevation gain that it feels more or less flat.  Most of the hike is through forest, with the first third being along the north shore of Upper Kananaskis Lake.  All stream crossings have sturdy bridges and the trail is well marked and signed.",
    "directions": "From Hwy 1, head south on Hwy 40 to Kananaskis Lakes Road.   Stay on Kananaskis Lakes Road until it ends at the Upper Lake Parking lot.",
