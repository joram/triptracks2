    "description": "Helena Ridge is a great option if you don't want to do Castle and get similar views. It is a superb amphitheatre and it's worth doing over 20 km to get there.You first get to Rockbound Lake and then keep walking along the lake on its right where you'll see a flag and a cairn. From there, it?s straight up to the right of a first gully that you will traverse left easily when arriving at a rock band. Then, you'll see the trail when taking some more elevation to a second gully, that time a much steeper scree slope. Keep going straight up to the col. Then, go to your left and you will see very soon 2 cairns, there's Helena's ridge highest point.Elevation of Helena Ridge of 2852 m, 2866 m officiallyGPS TRACK: This my GPX track from a three summit hike. Once at the Helena Ridge summit, just return the same way.",
    "directions": "From Banff, drive north up to 93 South/Castle Junction. Take this exit and keep going down to Castle Mountain. Turn right at the stop sign and the parking lot will be on your left a few seconds later, Rockbound Lake parking lot.",
