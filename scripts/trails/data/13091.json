    "description": "Completed on October 13, 2018 in winter conditions.Edwards Rating: I (II) M S (maybe moderate in those conditions)4 to 7 hoursElevation of 734 m NET, 874 m TOT & max 2464 m Gear: Poles, cleats if snow (beware of avalanche danger), helmet would be a good idea, potential rock falls on ledge walk.*****You can find separate trip reports for most of the trails we used today but this whole loop from Lake Agnes to Plain of 6 Glaciers trail is totally worth it in my opinion. We avoided an extra 2-2.5 km by not going all the way down to the 6 Glaciers tea house but feel free to go all the way if you have the energy and didn?t have a chance to go there yet. Views were just spectacular and we got away from the crowd once at the Big Beehive-Devil?s Thumb col. There is some exposure and steep slopes, so completing it in the snow is definitely more difficult (otherwise an easy scramble, mostly hiking). We had about 1-2 feet of snow in general so it was not too bad.We followed the obvious indications up to Lake Agnes. We then kept going around the lakeshore and turned left at the end to go up switchbacks leading to Big Beehive-Devil?s Thumb col. We turned right at the col and went almost straight up until we saw an obvious 2-3 days old track on the left going all along the Thumb?s cliff band. We walked on that nice ledge to a gully and turned right to go up a steep slope leading to Whyte-Devil?s Thumb col. We turned right at the col to reach our first summit. Incredible views of Aberdeen-Lefroy-Victoria glaciers, Whyte-Niblock-St Piran, Fairview-Temple, Lake Agnes and Louise, etc. It is a fine viewpoint, stunning! Going back down the same way to the first col, we continued up to Big Beehive. On our way back down, we turned left to go the opposite way at the col and followed the highline trail connector. We turned left a couple of times at intersections to get back down to the Plain of 6 Glaciers trail faster. Once we reached it, we turned left and followed it back to Lake Louise Lakeshore trail and the parking lot.",
