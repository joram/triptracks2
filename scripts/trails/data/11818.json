    "description": "This trip begins on the Sawmill most eastern or up mountain snowshoe trail loop in Kananaskis and continues on the Snowdrift trail and the up to the Mt. Murray Viewpoint.  It can be done as an out and back, or mixed with other loop options.  I did it as an out and back, as some of the snowshoe loop trails have been heavily damaged from the 2013 flooding.It's beautiful pine forest for the most part, with some up and down and not much climbing aside from the final 0.6 km to the viewpoint.  Some astounding mountain views pop out along the way as well as a couple nice creeks.  The signage is excellent.Not sure how good the viewpoint is as it was almost completely clouded in when I got there.  Oh well, just have to go again on a clear day!",
    "directions": "Take either Highway 40 south through Kanakaskis and turn north on Spray Trail for 15 km (parking will be on the right) OR take Spray Trail south from Canmore for 40 km (trail will be on the left).",
