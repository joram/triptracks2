    "description": "A hike to a seldom viewed fall in the Cape Breton highlands.   I spotted this white streak in the dense canopy of a valley near Big Intervale, CB.   A good dirt roads leads to a bridge over Stewart Brook.   Park here and continue upstream.  The woods towards the falls are a mature hardwood forest for the whole way. The canopy is high overhead and the ferns are sometime thigh high!The first major tributary on the right (looking upstream) has some beautiful waterfalls.  the climbing here is moderate and becomes a bit steep towards the end.  After climbing up about 200m you will come up to the largest fall so far..about a 15ft drop.  Climb on the left of the fall and come out on top and at the foot of a whopping 40ft fall which is framed by sheer rock walls.",
