    "description": "Bear Hill Park is very small, but if you resolve to touch every trail, and move at a good pace, you can actually get a decent little workout out of it; plus, it's a nice park with some great scenery, and stellar views at the summit.  There are 4 different ways to reach the summit and 3 accesses, more or less.  The park can be done any time, but there are rocky sections that would be greasy in rain or snow, but nothing insurmountable if you take your time at the dodgy spots.  Dogs may go off leash.  The north-south trail is bike-friendly, and some trails are used by horses.",
    "directions": "From Victoria, take airport highway and get off at the end of Elk Lake, turning west.  Continue and park at the Elk Lake parking, then walk back to pick up the trailhead.From the west, you can take Oldfield Road to Bear Hill Road and park in a small parking lot, and then summit from the western approach.",
