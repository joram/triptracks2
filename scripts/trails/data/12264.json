    "description": "7 mile trek up the west side of the mountain with about 3700' of elevation gain. The trail receives a great deal of traffic, particularly on weekends and holidays.",
    "directions": "To access the bottom trail head for the La Luz trail, , head Take I-25 North. Near the outskirts of town, Tramway Boulevard intersects I-25. Turn right on Tramway and follow it as it heads toward the Sandias. As the road nears the mountain, it begins to veer right (South). Before the road actually turns south, look for the Juan Tabo cut off on your left. Turn left on this road and proceed north for a mile or two until you see a road to your right leading to the Juan Tabo Picnic Area, which is marked by a sign. Follow this road to your right for several hundred yards to reach the parking lot for the Picnic Area. Here you will have to pay $3 per vehicle to park. The trail head for the La Luz is located on the edge of the parking lot and is quite easy to find.",
