    "description": "A secondary, 6km one-way route into the famous & scenic Ink Pots and surrounding meadows.  (and a secondary way to beyond there such as Larry's Camp/Mystic, etc.)  A great XC ski, some challenging climbs & descents, skins aren't mandatory but can be helpful.\nVery scenic route, the Ink Pots are mineral rich pools with interesting colours (somewhat muted in winter though).  The surrounding area is a very scenic but reasonably easy to access area.\nThe GPS log shows the trip past Ink Pots following the stream bed and coming back on the official trail.\nSetting out in -17C but a generally sunny day, this made a great event.  Current conditions:",
    "directions": "1.4 km *West* of the Johnston Canyon parking lot or 4.8 km *East* of the Castle Junction on Hiway #1A (Bow Valley Parkway).     You can get to it from either end (Castle or the first exit West of Mt. Norquay road).  Big picture: 142km West of Calgary Olympic Park lights.",
