    "directions": "Travel up Bachelor Heights road and cross the cattle guard. Take the second left which is about 2km past the cattle guard. It is on a sharp corner so you will have to watch for it. Go down the hill and park at the cattle guard. Walk across the guard on the road for about 25 meters until you see the trail on the right going up the hill. About 2/3 of the way up the hill, you will come to an intersection of trails, take the right hand trail. Continue up the hill until it flattens out and take the right trail at the next intersection, then an immediate left.Travel down the hill until you get to the bottom and take a hard left down the road. You should see a large open area which is a dried up pond. Continue down and across the pond and stay on the main trail along the left side of the fence. When you get to the corner of the fence, stay on the trail to the left and continue down until you get to the road. At the road go left and continue until you come to an intersection of roads, 2 left and one right. Take the second left and continue on until you arrive back at your vehicle.My stats:Total hike time: 1:24Total distance: 6:51kmTotal ascent: 165 metersTotal descent: 170 meters",
