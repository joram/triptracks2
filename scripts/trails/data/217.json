    "description": "LENGTH/TIME:\t\t2km/30mins\r\n\r\nHIGHLIGHTS: This trail meanders around limestone caves and sinkholes, while also being situated amongst a second old growth forest and a Homesite Creek waterfall.\r\n\r\nACCESS:\t3.1km north of Halfmoon Bay on Hwy 101, turn right onto the Homesite Creek Forest Service Road (the second logging road after Halfmoon Bay.) Proceed for 1.4km to the power lines. 100m after the power lines, park on the left and note the small cairn of orange painted rocks on the right, which indicates the trail.\r\n\r\nTERRAIN: The trail is rough with roots, rocks, and windfall.  Sections are steep as it parallels with the creek.  200m from the trailhead, the trail becomes an old spur road, which leads back to the main logging road. Turn left at the main logging road to walk 300m back to the beginning of the trail. \r",
