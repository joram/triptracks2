    "description": "More of a leg stretcher than a trail.  An awful lot of people drive by this fall on highway 101 without stopping by..I was one of them until February 2018.  I decided to finally stop and explore this area.  the Alains River in this area has been dammed for hydropower.  If you are lucky, the location of this fall will have water if the dam is letting some water flow out...sometimes I have seen this area bone dry.  From the highway traverse the mixed forest towards the fall.  there is a high bluff located by the side of the river and fall which has a nice viewpoint amidst an evergreen, mature, forest.",
    "directions": "Highway 101 from Bridgetown to Digby.  just a few hundred metres passed the Annapolis Royal exit (heading west), you cross the Allains River.  the fall is located upstream from the overpass.",
