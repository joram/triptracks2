    "description": "Cypress Hills Centre Block is the developed block of the Cypress Hills Interprovincial park. There are a number of trails. Easiest is to obtain a map at the information center on entry into the park.\r\rThere are a significant number of marked trails in the area. In general we started from the resort area. \rGPS data attached is for trails we chose. Highland, Valleyview, Whispering Pines, Moose, Lynx and Lodgepole.\r\rWe saw both Moose and deer in the area.\r\rTrails are basically a walk in the forest with minor elevation. There are frequent trail markers especially for X country skiing.\r\rThere is a fee to access this park",
    "directions": "From the Trans Canada take Highway 221 south to Maple Creek, Travel south about 30 km from Maple Creek, take highway 221 into the park. It's marked.",
