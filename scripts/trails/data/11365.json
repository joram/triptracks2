    "description": "This is a quad/snowmobile trail from highway 922 north of big river saskatchewan that leads to a handful of little lakes.  Little Red Willow, Little Osimisk and appears to continue on to Tatham and Nova Lakes and possibly a few other small unamed lakes on google maps.  I am only putting a route for the section i have done but if you look on google maps you can see a trail cut through the bush that would likely be pretty easy to follow in to the other lakes. Where the trail ends there was a small path through the bush down to the lake.  There was also another wider path that cut back south closer to the lake, this may be a better access point for the lake.  However when we were there the snow down that route was too deep for even the snowmobile!The lakes in this area would be good for bringing a canoe or small boat in for fishing or sight seeings.  Even just hiking the area could be pretty fun.   It seemed like more a skidoo trail, however i imagine it would be fun to cross country ski on too.",
    "directions": "Approximately 31.4 km north on highway 922 of the junction at highway 55  south of big river there is a little approach and a clearing in the bush with a  trail.  This is just after the turnoff for pancake lake (there is no pancake lake  sign but you can reference it on google maps)",
