    "description": "In an area that is sparse in waterfalls, I made my way to a couple of unknowns on Pete's Brook.   I wasn't exactly sure if there would be any on this brook but there was enough drop in topography to warrant an exploration.  From the road, I entered the woods parallel to a pasture.  I intersected a woods road and pushed my way to the stream.  I doesn't look like much at the top.  But by following it downstream, I was rewarded by a few falls ranging from 4-15ft.",
    "directions": "Highway 201.  turn on Cris Rd and park near the field at N44\u00b0 51' 43.7\" W65\u00b0 07' 02.7\".  Go NE from this point until you hit the stream and go downstream.",
