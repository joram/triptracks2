    "description": "Corona (complete) and Bowtie (in progress) Arches are two easy to find, easy to walk to, real, live, Utah Arches.  Corona is pretty big, too, probably 60' inside?\r\rThe only minor bit of route finding is to turn right when you get to a 'Tee' looking area about 1/2 mile (3/4km) in.  The path to the arches is reasonably well marked with a series of cairns and is mostly walking on high traction slickrock (no bikes allowed, alas).\r\rThere are a couple areas that have safety cables to hold on to and one small 4 step ladder that are all well-bolted to the bedrock, so it is relatively safe.",
    "directions": "Drive just to the North end of Moab, across to the N side of the Colorado RIver and turn South West on Hiway 279.  Drive about 16 km (10 miles) to the well marked parking lot / trailhead right on the side of the road.",
