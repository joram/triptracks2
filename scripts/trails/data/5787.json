    "description": "This is a very easy trail around Crawford Lake.  The trail is nearly entirely a boardwalk once you get to the lake.  The trail travels around Crawford Lake, a rare meromicitc lake that was once the site of a native community.  The trail is relatively flat.  I have travelled this trail in all seasons.  Each season brings a different experience.  There are numerous other trails in this park, including the Bruce Trail.  The trail is a 1.5 kilometre loops and take less than an hour to complete.",
