    "description": "A nice little urban walk, ride, saunter and you might even learn something.  It can tie in with a trip along the South shore of the harbour all the way out to Fort Amhurst where the whales will be frollicking (srsly!).\nWe saw whales, otters, lighthouses, big old guns, East Coast Trail trailheads and scrunchions.  It was perfect.\nThe T'Railway is the old NL rail line, now the TCT (Trans Canada Trail) and the entire 9 brazillion kilometer ROW (right-of-way) is a linear provincial park all the way to Port aux Basques.  This trail is just the Eastern tip of all that, but gives GREAT views across the harbour of downtown St. Johns, the shipping and fishing industries.  You have to do this trail.",
    "directions": "Downtown St. John's, Newfoundland.  Schweeet !  West-ish end of Water street at the old train station and/or the *very* West end of the harbour, you will find a little bridge crossing the stream at the end.  Start riding/walking/sauntering there.",
