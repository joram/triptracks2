    "description": "Nice hike around Witherod lake.  You can find swimmers near the southern part of the lake (witherod), and if you continue on, the trail goes throughout Long Lake. Fair amount of people walking dogs as well. Tim Hortons on the corner of Osborne and NW Arm drive but no gas stations or convenience stores.",
    "directions": "There are two entraces from the North West Arm Dr, one just near Osborne St, and one right by Cowie Hill Connector. Definitely recommend the Cowie Hill Connector entrace if you are looking to take it easy, as the Osborne entrance (or exit for me) turned out to be a bit of bushwhacking, though I'm sure there is a defined exit I managed to miss .",
