    "description": "This is a short and easy trail but the views are great. It is only 830 m in one direction with 160 m of vertical decline. From the bluff above Tagham you can see Nelson, Tagham and the Kootenay River.A trail continues from the bluff towards Sproule Creek Road but it gets pretty steep and appears to head towards private property so I did not follow it all the way down. It may actually just be a game trail.",
    "directions": "Access to the trailhead starts off the same as for the Small Wood and Big Wood Trails. Starting at Queen Victory Road off of Beasley Road, bare right at every intersection of forest service roads. At km 2.8 you pass the interaction of Garrity Forest Service Road at the parking are for the Small Wood and Big Wood trails. Keep going straight. At km 4.4 you cross Small Wood Creek. At km 4.6 bear right onto the Sproule Creek Forest Service Road. The trailhead is at km 8.5. Look for a small white sign and orange and yellow flagging.",
