    "description": "Bottoms Up is a wide gentle machine built climb. Upper Bottoms continues on climbing with a few steeper sections, but overall fairly gentle grade for Nelson. Turnstyles is a wide, bermed machine made jump run (think Whistler's A-Line minus the crowds). Lefty continues on with similar trail, albeit a bit tighter and less wide open than Turnstyles.",
    "directions": "Heading out of Nelson, take a left onto Granite Rd. Look for signs for Morning Mountain recreation area and follow signs to the lot.",
