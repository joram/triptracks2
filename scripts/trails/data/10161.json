    "description": "This is a steep hike up through some avalanche terrain with rewarding views up top. The trail is marked up to the elevation of 2100m (summit ridge). Once in the avalanche paths it's a continual search for the trail markers but they do exist (as of Fall 2010).  Several beautiful lakes are accessible and have clean glacial like water.\nWe opted to take the direct route out (from the lake on) using a GPS and saw several trail markers on trees but not enough to follow a definitive trail.",
    "directions": "Turn left (north) at Franks Store onto Sugar Lake Rd in Cherryville\nAt 16 km stay Right on Sugar Lake Rd\nMake a hairpin right on Sitkum Creek Rd at 27km (from Franks).\nFollow gravel rd and cross bridged creek at 7.8 km.\nAnother 5.2km will lead you to dead end for parking.\nTrailhead is clearly marked. \nSuitable for a truck but not a car. No 4x4 necessary.",
