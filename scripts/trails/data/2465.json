    "description": "NTS Map: 082J01Sentinel Pass & peak from South, Hike number 235 in Gillaen Daffern's \"Kananasksis Country Trail Guide\" volume 2.In fact we missed the planned route noted below. We went further down the road, bush wacked back to Sentinel Pass and up the north slope of Sentinel Peak then returned via meadow to Hailstone fire road. Finally to avoid walking out on the road we followed the Hailstone fire road to the Lookout and then came down Hailstone to the road about 1km north of the locked gate. Once out of the trees there are great views especially of Mt Burke to the north. You can walk along the ridge for a substantial distance. There is memorial on Sentinel Peak. It was about a 22km hike that does 2 peaks in one loop. It's a long but great loop hike if you follow our GPS track. You could easily deviate in places especially the descent from Hailstone.",
    "directions": "Starting from the locked gate a few meters west of Junction of Hwy 940 and hwy 532, walk up the road for about 3 km then keep right on better road. In another 1.1 turn right onto Hailstone fire road. At the meadows follow trail to left which leads to Sentinel Peak.",
