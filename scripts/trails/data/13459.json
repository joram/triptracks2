    "description": "Another spot that I would not have explored but it's a good thing that Mike Whalen did!  Thanks Mike!  Following the brook about 1km from the shoreline, you will come up to a gorgeous and unexpected fall on Brown Brook!  I followed dear tracks....actually more like a deer highway,  pretty much the whole way upstream to the fall.",
