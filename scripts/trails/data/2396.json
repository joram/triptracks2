    "description": "There is definately some hike a bike, but not too extreme. The trail follows the powerline up the Cheakamus Canyon past a couple nice river camping spots. A rough ride through some rock fields. After crossing the tracks, you end up at Starvation Lake. This is a cross-country trail, not too much for the thrill seeker but hard work and a nice spot for lunch at the top. I have seen this trail listed in a few books but it is not well traveled as one would be led to beleive. We parked up Paradise Valley near the river and rode the last part of the gravel. This was a little more challenging than we expected based on what we read, but OK none the less",
    "directions": "Past Squamish, take Cheakamus Road into Paradise Valley. You can drive quite far up Cheakamus but we parked along the river.",
