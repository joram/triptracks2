    "description": "Completed on February 24, 2018, snowshoeingEdwards Rating: I (II) M S ? Mostly a hike but bushwhacking involved3.5 to 6 hoursElevation of 726 m NET, 782 m TOT & max 2109 mGear: Poles, GPS device and/or compass, snowshoes and/or microspikes.*****This was a surprisingly nice hike for us. We spotted that hill when revisiting Baldy Pass a couple of weeks ago and thought it would be a good one to do with a lot of snow this year. The usual approach is SE but the road is closed there from December till May, so we went up its west slope for an extra 5 km total. The approach in the valley east of Mount Baldy offers impressive views from Baldy to Bryant and summit views are rewarding for such a small and low hill.From the parking lot, we turned right on AB-68 and got to Lusk Pass Trail on the other side of the road about 100 metres away. We followed that trail for about 3.4 km and then started bushwhacking up the slope on our left (GR404531). There are several flagging systems but none seemed to make sense so we just snowshoed up and right looking to stay on the right side of a gully showing a potential rock band on the map eventually. We came across lots of deadfall and boulders at some point but generally bushwhacking was easy to moderate. After passing an open slope, the last portion is not as steep but it was steeper and challenging as we had no existing tracks to follow. We finally got to the ridge (GR421531) and took our snowshoes off to walk up the dry ridge and reach the summit cairn (GR424528) about 300 metres up to our right. We obviously went back down the exact same way to take advantage of our fresh track.",
