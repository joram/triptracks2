    "description": "This is a pretty steep trail that ends at Cypress lake.  The trail is forested the whole way with no scenic views.  Cypress lake is pretty, though small, and not suitable for swimming.    The upside of this trail is that there is plenty of water if you are walking with your four legged friend.  Cute little waterfalls here and there.",
