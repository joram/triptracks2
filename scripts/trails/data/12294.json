    "description": "This trail can be done 2 ways or in a loop. One way would be to park at buntzen parking lot and start the harvor lunden trail at the map just behind the yellow gate so you can park in the parking lot first on the right. The other way would be from the entrance of the park, there is a trail to your right the academy trail which you take and eventually take a right to eagle bluff (well marked there is a sign telling you to turn right). You can also do a loop meaning you can go up harvor lunden trail and take the junction to the right after 300 meters elevation (well marked also) to eagle bluff and once at the viewpoint just follow the service road to the next tower and clearly there is a trail going right take that down keeping right at the first junction then right again at the junction that says academy trail. This will take you back to the parking lot. Its a good enough workout if you dont have much time or are not planning on doing anything too hard. The view is good of mt seymour buntzen lake burnaby mountain and some of the city. Good also for the kids not too long and fun for them to go uphill then downhill.",
    "directions": "Take Barnet hwy and take a right on ioco road and follow the signs to Buntzen lake.Drive to the end of the road where there will be a yellow gate the road curves left at this point and park on the closest parking to the right since you wanna be as close from that yellow gate.",
