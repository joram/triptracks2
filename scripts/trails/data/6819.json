    "description": "A very steep challenging climb up small sections of scree slope and exposed rock. The summit features panoramic views of Shuswap Lake over Blind Bay. You can climb up to the lookout in 1 1/3 km, then back down, or form a loop around the backside for a 5 1/2 km loop\r\n\r",
    "directions": "\r\n\r\nApprox. 9.3km East of Sorrento, or approx. 24 km West of Salmon Arm, turn North on onto Balmoral Rd. and travel North to Reedman Point Rd., approx 2km past the Blind Bay Rd. junction. Turn right and take the next left onto McBride Rd. Follow McBride Rd. through the McArthur Heights subdivision to the end of the road and park (make sure to not block any driveways). The trail starts 10m up the ATV track on the left (private property on the right). For an extended hike, follow the signs from the summit to the Balmoral parking lot.",
