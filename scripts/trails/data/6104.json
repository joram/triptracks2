    "description": "The plan as envisaged calls for a 7 nautical mile clockwise paddle round\nthe bay calling at the Bedford Island tombolo, where we might see some small surf on the drying beach, and South Bedford, from where we'll see Race Rocks lighthouse to the south east. Weather permitting we will cross 1\u00bc miles to Creke Point for lunch. This is the Aylard Farm beach in East Sooke Regional Park. After lunch we'll paddle past Lions Bay Marina and RV park, through Murder Bay (you can read about it) and past Wolf Island where a house was built just a few years ago.",
    "directions": "Meet at Cheanhu Marina by 9:30 am so as to be on the water by 10 am.\nWhere: Cheanhu Marina is 2 km past the entrance to DND Rocky Point Property and 2\u00bd km past Pedder Bay Marina. Look for the large wooden ?archway? on your left. There's a bumpy gravel road down to the launch ramp and marina office.  You'll need $5 for the launch fee and this gets you washroom privileges.  There's plenty of parking.",
