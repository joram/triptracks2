    "description": "Dixon Lake, a quiet reservoir for drinking water located on the northeast edge of Escondido, offers camping, hiking, picnicking and fishing. In March 2005, a 25.1-pound world-record-sized largemouth bass was hooked and released by Mac Weakley, of Carlsbad. There are plenty of big bass, planted trout and catfish.\nThe trail only goes along one side, you cannot cross the dam.",
