    "description": "NTS Map:92F8.  There is a spectacular waterfall here.  Noisy, lots of mist and raging water, everything you would expect from a waterfall.  There are also nice easy trails along the river, about an hours? worth unless you follow the trail outside of the park.  There is a smaller waterfall at the other end of the hiking loop which is also really nice on its own.",
    "directions": "Englishman River Falls Provincial Park is located 13 km southwest of Parksville on central Vancouver Island. Take Errington Road off Highway 4, toward Port Alberni. Directional signs are posted on the main highways.",
