    "description": "NTS Map: 082G01Elevation Gain - 950 m (3,120 ft).This trail is an extension of the Rowe Meadow trail in WNP. It is 16km  and 6-7 hours return. \r\nAfter leaving Rowe Meadow (5km from trailhead), start across the creek on a trail for both the Upper Rowe Lakes and for Lineham Ridge. Turn right at the junction (signed) and begin a short (10-15 minutes) moderately steep climb through the trees. Once above the treeline, the trail follows a long sweeping arc across the headwall of Rowe Valley. Near the top of the ridge, a series of switchbacks eases the ascent as it steepens.\r\nAt the ridge you are rewarded with great views of the Rowe Valley, the Upper Rowe Lakes and down the other side to the Lineham Lakes.\r\nAdventurous parties can continue east along the ridge for a shot at Mount Lineham, an easy scramble from the ridge. Bottom right photo shows the Lineham Lakes with Mt Lineham on the right and Mt Blakiston on the left.\r\nThis trail forms part of the Tamarack Trail, one of the longest and highest in Waterton, with access at the west end of the ridge , to Lone Lake campground.\r\nReturn the way you came.Photos by Shelley CoffeyCurrent conditions:\r\n\r\n\r",
