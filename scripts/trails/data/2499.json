    "description": "NTS Map: 082h0412 km return, elevation gain/loss-350'/375'.The lakeshore trail in Wateron Lakes National Park is not what the name suggests. Very little of the trail is close to the lake, however, it does follow the lakeshore, hence the name. The trail leaves the Waterton townsite at the  Bertha Falls/Lake   trailhead and leaves that trail (left)at a signed junction 1.5km up the trail. At this point you will experience the total elevation loss (gain on the return) for this trail, as it descends quickly to the lake. At the bottom of this slope you will cross Bertha Creek and shortly beyond is Bertha Bay campground.The trail undulates up and down moderately after this point until you reach the international boundary marker at 6km.Current conditions:",
