    "description": "Lower Crippler is a quick little trail near the bottom of Fromme, and is one of my favourite ways to finish off a ride since it dumps you right out onto Braemar instead of forcing you to traverse the Baden back to Mountain Highway. \nThe trail features some nice flowing lines, including some reasonable rock faces, a roller-coaster and a big bridge that extends across a small valley. A very fun trail when combined with Grannies or Espresso.\nMore Mt Fromme mountain biking trails can be found here.",
    "directions": "From Grannies, make a left turn (East) onto the Baden and the trail is on your right within a very short ride.\nFrom Espresso, make a right turn (West) onto the Baden and you should intersect it within 5 minutes. There's a little uphill/hike a bike this way.\nThe trailhead is fairly obvious and is identifiable by the mostly granite entrance.",
