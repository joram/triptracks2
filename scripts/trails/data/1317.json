    "description": "Fortress Ridge starts at Fortress ski hill in Kananaskis country, and to make it even better, you're already at 7,000'. Head up the service road or one of the runs to gain the first ridge (not Fortress Ridge). You can then either follow this ridge around to your left (long way) or descend to the creek and ascend the runs up the other side (hard way). Either way takes you to the ridge proper. Now head north along the ridge and enjoy the constantly changing views (the beauty of ridge walking). As a side trip on the way back (or as a substitute if it's too windy), you can drop down the west side of the ridge and visit Fortress Lake, sitting at the bottom of the Fortress, a great scramble of its own, (from the back side).NTS Map: 082J14Elevation gain: 635m (2,080 ft).",
