    "description": "Completed on August 21, 2017 in dry conditions.Edwards Rating: I (II) S S ? Mostly a hike but some scrambling as we got off trail2 to 4 hoursElevation of 597 m NET, 625 m TOT & max 2770 mGear: Poles (every hike)*****This is a beautiful short but steep hike with a great trail all along but we went off trail to make it more enjoyable and do some easy scrambling up to and on the ridge. It is a rewarding hike with incredible views!From the parking spot, we followed the trail up to the creek when views open on the valley and Mount Arethusa. We crossed it and followed the trail going left toward Little Arethusa. Once we got over the treeline, we kept going straight up instead of following the trail to the left and used good rock bands and slabs to scramble straight up to the beginning of the ridge. Once on the ridge, I followed the ridge line for some fun scrambling and a bit of exposure but a good trail to the left is available if you don?t want to get close to the cliff. We got to the summit and enjoyed incredible views of surrounding peaks: Mount Rae, Storm Mountain, Mount Tyrwhitt and Pocaterra, Highwood Ridge and so on. We went down the real trail following cairns for an easy and quick descent back to the valley and our ascent route.",
