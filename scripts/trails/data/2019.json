    "description": "This lovely hike climbs over Peachland, offering terrific views of Peachland and Okanagan Lake.  There are some steep sections and footing can be slippery especially on the way down due to loose gravel.  The climb takes about 1 hour from the trailhead with good rest spots along the way.  \nFrom the trailhead, follow the red #3 markers -- watch out for the red trail turning to the left and the yellow #2 markers continue going straight.  Red # 3 markers will take you to the peak.  At the summit (815m) enjoy views of the area, and hike down a bit further to the flag.  Return to the trailhead by retracing your route, again following the red markers.\nMore details can be found at:\nhttp://www.peachland.ca/parks/",
    "directions": "From Kelowna and the Coquillhala Connector, travel south on Hwy 97 to Peachland.  Turn right on Ponderosa Drive, follow it until almost the end, until you see Private Drive.  Park at the bottom of the Private Drive and hike 100 m up the private drive to the trailhead.  Coming from Penticton, travel north on Hwy 97, turning left on Ponderosa Drive.",
