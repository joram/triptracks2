    "description": "In the middle of Dieppe, NB, lies a set of trails used for a variety of purposes such as hiking, running, snow shoeing and mountain biking.  We spent about an hour in and out of some single track mountain bike trails in that park.  There are multiple sections of good single tracks while some sections are very rooty.  The roots and the cover of fallen leaves make those places very slick to go through.  Some other sections had some earth banks dug which makes them very smooth and fast.  Good set of trails when you cannot get out of the city for the day.  Some of the mtn bike trails have little rectangular signage with names of trails on them.  The park does have some elevation gain/loss so you can actually gain some good speed on the descents.",
    "directions": "Highway 106 or Amirault St.  You can get into the park on a path right by the bridge over Fox Creek.",
