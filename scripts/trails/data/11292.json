    "description": "I had previously visited this spot but it is so close to Greenwood that it's a good place to explore when you have some spare time in the valley.  This place is also called RockNotch Falls.  I was there in November 2013 and there was new signs, trails and new viewing plateform over the gorge.  The sign at the entrance called this place McMaaster Mill. You can see some of the old mill buildings and sluice by the gorge.  On the opposite bank of the official park you will aslo find a trail leqading you closer to the gorge and largest falll.  the forest on the offcial trail side is decisuous while tall pine and hemlock tower over you on the opposite bank.  It's a nice place to explore, take pictures, go for a swim (careful where you enter the stream)  and have a pic nic.",
    "directions": "Highway 201 in Greenwood, Take the Tremont Mountain Rd and turn keft on Harmony Rd.  turn left on Rocknotch Rd and park at the entrance to the park.",
