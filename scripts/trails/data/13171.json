    "description": "This is well hidden gem in Country Harbour.  I used an ATV trail to get into the woods close to the ravine created by Lewis Brook.  I teh nplunged into the ravine and followed it upstream.  Within a few hundred metres, the wall rose even steeper on both sides and there in front of me where a bunch of nice waterfalls.  BTW Christopher Sinclair told me about these falls.  Ultimately, the Fletcher-Faribault maps of the 1880s also shows this fall and they were a waypoint in my gps for a long time.  I just don't live very close to Country Harbour to do a pit stop at those falls before.",
    "directions": "Highway 316 in Country Harbour.  There is an abandonned house on one side of the stream and the ATV trail is set at the back of that house; N45.25257 W61.81827.",
