    "description": "Follow Highway 23 south for 10km to the trail head on the right side of highway. A steep km trail leads you to the toe of the glacier. Mountaineering skills are requiered to complete the final climb to the summit. The glacier is crevased so roped travel and crevase rescue knowledge are requiered. Assend the glacier from it's snout traversing to the left. Approximatley 200m up the glacier to the left you will be able to see a large ledge the traverses the middle peak (careful crossing the bergsrund). Once on this ledge follow it to the arete of the middle peak. At this point you will follow the ridge to the summit (scramble). From the glacier it takes approximatley two and a half hours. Be mindful of the afternoon weather as thunderstorms are common in the spring and summer.",
