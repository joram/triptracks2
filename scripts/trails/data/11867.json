    "description": "Originally planned as a 2 day trip with a bunch of families, we shortened it to a day trip due to bad weather forecasted for the 2nd day. There were more campsites on Lone Island island than we had thought, and were able to find a nice sandy area to pull up our 7 canoes and hang out, fish, and do a quick explore of the Malloy Lake portage which leads you close to 2 abandoned cabins and 1 that looks like it might be on the verge of abandonment! No need to bring your canoe over to Malloy, as there's an entire graveyard of ~40 fishing boats at the launch area, probably 1/2 of which are abandoned but floatable if you bring a plug!",
    "directions": "From Winnipeg, the fastest way is Hwy 15 due East, North on Hwy 11, East on Hwy 44, North on Hwy 307, NE on Hwy 309, and follow the signs until you get to the boat launch for Lone Island Lake.",
