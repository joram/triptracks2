    "description": "I start this hike from Lake Mansfield Trout Club parking lot with Lake Mansfield Trail which is side trail of Long Trail.  Once we reached to Taylor Lodge after hiking 1.6 miles, we took a short break (there is a toilet nearby), then, we hiked to Long Trail to the Forehead, to The Nose, to Upper Lip, Lower Lip and to the highest peak in VT -- The Chin (4393 ft, 1339 m).  After peakbagged The Chin, we moved on further on Long Trail toward North to hike out of Mt Mansfield, then, reached to the LT Trailhead on Rt 108 which is very close to Stowe Ski Resort.\r\rTrail was well maintained and there were some portion of the trails which were muddy due to recent rains.",
    "directions": "Take I-89 and exit 10 at Stowe/Waterbury, then take Rt 100 North, take left turn on Moscow Road before reaching to Stowe.  After driving 1.2 miles on Moscow Road, take Nebraska Valley Road for 5.5 miles, you'll enter the private property of Lake Mansfield Trout Club.  The parking lot for hikers is located at upper right hand side. (It's free).\r\r",
