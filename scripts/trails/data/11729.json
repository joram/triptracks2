    "description": "Mt Clifton is a northern peak in the Beaufort Range on Vancouver Island. The summit is treed and the final portion of the hike is beautiful. However, the hike, once at the end of the road, is short, less than 3km. Clifton is likely better to be done as a trip where you climb multiple peaks in the same day.Read my blog for a full trip report and more photographs: http://nolofacereinsipida.blogspot.com/2014/12/MtClifton.html",
    "directions": "From Port Alberni, drive down Beaver Creek Road. Turn right on Somners Road and eventually turn left onto Valley Link Highway. At the Four-way intersection, turn left to cross Lantern Creek. Take your third left onto Branch 103 Rd. Follow Branch 103 Rd until it connects to Toma Mainline.  Follow toma until you find the gate for the start of the hike. If you hit the much older gate that would give access further along Toma you have passed the gate by about 2-3 km. If the gate is open count yourself lucky, you could drive up the road an additional 5 km to shorten the hike.",
