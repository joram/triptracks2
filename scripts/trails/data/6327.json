    "description": "There is a 2500' elevation gain in the 3.2 km to get to the timberline from the end of the road. But once you get to the alpine you can wander just about anywhere. At a low point in the trail not long after reaching the first alpine meadow there is a sign and trail leading off to the left, this will take you to the YORA Swift Creek alpine cabin. Registration is required if you want to stay in the cabin, there is a small fee to cover maintenance, etc. contact Raven office supplies for bookings (250-566-4225). There are beautiful alpine meadows as well as several other trails leading to and from this alpine area.  Allow 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours to reach the alpine meadows and the better part of a day for a good round trip with plenty of stops for lunches and site seeing. There are exceptional views of the surrounding mountain ranges as well as Mount  Robson.",
    "directions": "Follow 5th avenue to the rail road track, Turn right on Main street for a short distance. Turn left at the first road and follow this watching out for signs indicating Swift Mountain forestry rd. Take this rd upwards to the right past the local TV towers which should be on you left. Follow the road to for as far as it goes. This is a fairly steep road so 4 wheel drive is recommend. Once you get to the top there is a trail that leads off to the left.",
