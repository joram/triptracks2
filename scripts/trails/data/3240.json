    "description": "Coastal trail with large granite boulders, expansive ocean views, and some challenging rocky beaches. Excellent hike, surprisingly remote feeling and secluded, yet very close to the city.\r\rAllow time for the hike. The rocky beaches will slow you down, and you will want to take a few breaks to enjoy the scenery.",
    "directions": "From Halifax, take Hwy 349 to Sambro. Follow the signs to Crystal Crescent beach. Follow the path to and beyond the beaches (note that the third beach is clothing-optional). Keep following the path, and then follow the coastline until you reach Pennant Point where you can go no further. Return along the coastline, or the inland trail (which can be muddy when it's wet).",
