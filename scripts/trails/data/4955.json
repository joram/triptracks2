    "description": "If the wind is stiff you might be challenged keeping the craft pointed downstream.  We did this with a Troop of Boy Scouts and some of the younger boys were challenged.  It would be one thing if the river didn't twist and turn so much but with the stiff breeze and the constantly turing river it is a moderate challenge, especially in a canoe.  The guys in the kayaks, with less sail area tended to do better.  We actually didn't finish in Mass but I'll have to put the rest of the trail as a sepaerate trail in the great state of CT.  The put in was a bit steep but there was plenty of parking.",
    "directions": "The put in is about a mile North of Sheffield just off of Rt. 7.  Make a right onto Broadman.",
