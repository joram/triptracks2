    "description": "1442 metres of elevation gain made this a challenging trip, but it is well marked with cairns or ribbons all the way. If my feet were not so sore, I would give it a higher rating.Glad we did this during the excellent weather of September 2018.Most hikers seem to start and end at the ACC, but we would highly recommend this traverse given the effort involved. A clearer day would have given us better views of Assiniboine.",
    "directions": "Traversing from east to west, we started at the Rat's Nest Cave parking area 5 km east of Canmore on the 1A highway. We left a car at the Alpine Club of Canada on the Indian Flats Rd just east of Canmore, for our return.",
