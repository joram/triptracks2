    "description": "Easy winding river, one hour drive west of Edmonton. Kayaking is the best option because late summer water levels can get low for canoes. Depending on water level the paddle should take anywhere from 6-10 hours.\nThis paddle is near:",
    "directions": "END POINT (LEAVE A VEHICLE HERE OR ARRANGE PICKUP)\nFrom Edmonton go west on highway 16 (Yellowhead) about 90km until you reach the Entwistle exit ramp (North) highway 16A. There should be signs that say Pembina Provincial park just before the exit ramp. Drive through Entwistle north through town on highway 16A until you reach the Pembina provincial park about 1-2 km out of town (entrance on the right of the highway).  Pembina provincial park has a dayuse area with free daily parking and entrance.\nLAUNCH POINT\nFrom highway 16 going west from the Entwistle exit ramp drive 1km then exit south onto Range Road 75a (directly across highway 16 from Evansburg). Follow Range Road 75a, it will sweep west then back south, at this point it turns into Range Road 80. Follow Range road 80 south all the way to the end (where the pavement ends). Continue straight ahead but keep watch for a sign on the left (while going south) which identifies a pembina river boat launch. The launch is very close to where the road changes from pavement to gravel. There should be a little pull out to the left (Usually too Muddy to use) then a small walking trail (20-30meters) that leads down to the water. The sign identifying the boat launch reads something like: \"ATTENTION from this point in the river to the pembina provincial park is a 10-12hour float with no exit\"",
