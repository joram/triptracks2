    "description": "A serious scramble that allows three peaks to be bagged in one trip!The scramble starts up the Heart Mountain trail, continues on to Grant MacEwan Peak and then onto the two peaks unofficially known as the \"Twin Towers\". The Towers are part of a long ridgeline that connects up with Mt. Lorette.The portion of the GPS track that is most westerly once south of Gran MacEwan Peak involves a difficult 6 m downclimb that can be avoided by transversing along the eastern portion of the GPS track.People attempting this scramble should be very comfortable with scrambling!",
    "directions": "Head west on the Trans Canada (Highway 16) for 75 kilometers and turn south at the Lac des Arcs interchange. Park at the Heart Creek Trailhead.",
