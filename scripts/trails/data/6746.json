    "description": "Niquette Bay State Park is saved by the Lake Champlain Land Trust.  Approximately 20-25 cars can park at the parking lot.\rThere are 4 trails, Ledges Trail (0.9 miles), Allen Trail(0.9 miles), Burns Trail(0.8 miles) and Muhley Trail(1.6 miles), in total.  \r\r  The GPS map shows the route of Allen Trail (hike in) & Muhley Trail (hike out).  There is a beach and cove area at Lake Champlain throughout the trails and we can swim in summer time.  The longest loop trail would be Ledges Trail & Muhley Trail.  You can see nice views on lake and masfield from several view points.\rThere are a lot of hikers and dogs on sunny weekends.",
    "directions": "From Exit-17 off I-89, take on Rt-2 West about an mile. At the Raymond Road exit, veer right to exit Rt-2, and then turn left. (Please note that you cannot turn left on Raymond Rd directly from Rt-2)  The park will be on your left approx. 0.5 miles down on Raymond Road. There is a sign for Niquette Bay State Park.",
