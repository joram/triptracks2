    "description": "Time and distance are for a return trip. Dog Lake is located about 3km east of Hwy 93 in Kootenay National Park. The trail starts at a rest area (well signed) about 30km north of Radium. Although relatively easy, there is a long straight uphill section which may slow some people down a bit. The trail crosses the Kootenay River twice - on a suspension bridge and then on a solid bridge, then proceeds through mixed forest.\r\rFor the less fit there is a bench at the top of the grade.",
