    "description": "This is exploration at its best.  I was on my way between two different hikes when I spotted these high cliffs running away from the road.  I decided these warranted a further look.  I set off on a line directly in the middle of the cliffs which had a few trees here and there.  After much effort and some scary bouldering I was rewarded with a spectacular view of Deep cove and surrounding area.  There are a few spots on top that are bare of all trees but have a deep carpet of vegetation which could be used for a picnic area for sure.  The cliffs are also interesting as they are a deep rusty colour.  The forest in the back of the cliffs is made up of mature pine trees and if you look carefully you will spot a rail that will take you down all the way to the road without having to scale the cliffs themselves....definitely safer but not as fun!",
    "directions": "Highway 329 from East River.  Drive to Deep Cove, the cliffs are at the intersection of Deep Cove Rd and highway 329",
