    "description": "This is a very enjoyable trek on a mix of trails off of the High Rim Trail. Difficult to give directions as there are so many trails and branches crisscrossing each other. Some of the trails used were High Rim, Pond Loop, No Boats, Serendipity, Old Cabin & Acropdobia. The south side of the Pond is like a rain forest without the rain and you can listen to all the frogs. Total hike time was about 1:15 and covered 3.3km but, you could spend a lot more time there. Depending on which direction you go, the hike is pretty easy. There are a few climbs if you do the reverse but nothing too bad.",
    "directions": "Take the road to the main gate & parking lot for the Kalamalka Lake Park. From the gate & parking lot, travel 2.9km on the gravel road to the start of the trail on the left. The first path you will come to is the High Rim Trail and you used to be able to park there but, they have now posted it \"No Parking, Evacuation Route\". The Pond Loop Trail is about 150 meters further up the road and there is room to park one small vehicle if you are careful. You can park here or go to the 3.4/3.5km marker which is the Crash of 08 trail, which has room for at east 3 vehicles and walk down the road to the trail start unless you have someone to drop off & pick up.\r\rThe Pond is about 1/2km from the the trail start and when you get to it, take the left path. The right path is the one you will come back on. In a short distance you will come to the High Rim Trail and if you look to the left, you will see the No Boats Trail. From there it is difficult to give direction due to the number of branches. All the paths are marked with difficulty levels and most cross the High Rim trail so you really can't get lost if you don't have a GPS.",
