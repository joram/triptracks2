    "description": "The hike begins at the campsite and travels along the Murrey River and then you hike up a ridge where you can actually get a break from the trees and take in some scenery.  There are campsites at the 7, 13, 20, and 25km mark (the last being Monkman Lake).  They all have good fire pits, bear caches, and when I was there the Monkman Lake camp had 2 large axes, and an emergency heli pad.  There is a side trail at around the 20km mark that will take you down into a trail that loops down into the Cascades, a series of nice waterfalls, then back up to the main trail.  The ground past the 20km mark is pretty soggy, even in late summer, and the trail markers are harder to find..",
    "directions": "From Tumbler Ridge take Hwy 52 till you get to the Murrey FSR (if you get to the airport turn off you've gone too far), take this for approx 50km till you get to Monkman Provincial Park.  There is camping and ample parking, and the trail head is along the Murrey River.",
