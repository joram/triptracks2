    "description": "Castle Mountain, near Lake Louise, is a big grand mountain.  This trail meanders up into the very middle of the mountain.  Like a big cavity in a tooth, the mountain is hollow in the middle.  There are 2 lakes - the topmost is called Rockbound Lake.  It is a cold and lonely place.  It's quiet, peaceful, pretty and a bit dull.  The hike is moderately strenuous with only a few places to see much but it's still nice.",
    "directions": "Heading west from Banff, take highway 93 northeast to the Castle Junction at highway 1a, turn right and then very shortly turn left into the parking lot.  This is the trailhead.",
