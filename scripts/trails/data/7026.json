    "description": "A short but strenuous hike of about 1.1 km up to a viewing platform with telescope at the dizzying altitude of 500'.  There are 6 benches along the way should you feel the need to stop and smell the roses.\r\rThe view at the top is quite nice and you can see Bonavista Bay and Eastport Bay as well as Sandy Cove Pond and the surrounding area for miles.  You may even find a little cairn at the top in celebrations of some Albertans getting to NL finally.",
    "directions": "Go to Sandy Cove. East on hiway 310 from the #1 about 60km South of Gander, past the top edge of Terra Nova National Park, through Eastport, and look for Sandy Cove Road just South of 310, follow it to the end, turn left at Tee and go to parking area.\r\r",
