    "description": "Smack in the middle of Beford lies a small wilderness area protected as a national historic site by Parks Canada.  This wilderness was protected a few years ago as some MicMac pteroglyphs were discovered.This is the information  had in hand as I was planning a hike with the family to try to seek those drawings out.   Since there are sketched on stone, I looked at some satellite imagery and found some long and narrow outcrops in numerous places throughout the wilderness area.The walk on the outcrops is easy and sometimes you will find some faint trails to get you to the next one....but more often than not you have to bushwack from place to place.  We searched and searched on the outcrops but this time were not rewarded by finding the drawings.  I will have to go back.  However it's a nice little spot to explore right in the middle of the city.",
    "directions": "Take Rutledge street off the Bedford highway and park by the children park.  there is a trail at the back end of the park which leads you to the first rock outcrop.",
