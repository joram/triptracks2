The trail is gravel laid, with benches, boardwalks and stair systems to suit the terrain. A bridge crosses Indian River at one point, and at one end, a small waterfall is home to a salmon ladder. There, the history of the river is explained.  At the other end, a long railed boardwalk meanders along the river?s shore grasses.\nThe RIverwood Inn is also a spot the trail trips through, so if you?re staying there, you?ll have a great place for your morning or evening strolls, offering great scenic views of the river.\nShannon Burt\nEast Coast editor\nNOTE:  The attached GPS data is only the SouthEast 1/3 of the trail, there is another 5 km to the West.",
