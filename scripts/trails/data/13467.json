    "description": "I often look at sat imagery to find places to explore.  Near Powder Mill Lake is a series of patches of rocks in the woods that seemed o indicate some bouldering opportunities...so I went to check it out!\n\nThis patch of forest off Rocky Lake Drive has a few ATV sie trails and some smaller ones too!  I followed a small one then bushwacked to where I thought the cliffs would be ...of course I ended  up back on the ATV path so that bushwacking was for nothing...although the forest was quite nice and open.\n\nThe main cliff is approximately 25-30 ft and looks solid for climbing.  the area to the north and west if it has numerous large fern covered boulders of which one or two had some bouldering potential.  Lots of cracks and fissures of the boulders make a lot of places to squeeze into if you are into seplunking!\n\nOne of the smaller path crossed a small stream where a 3ft cascade lies.",
