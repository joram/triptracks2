    "description": "The Columbia River Trail connects the Cities of Castlegar and Trail on the east side of the Columbia River. Spanning across many different forest types, this trail is a wonderful asset that connects these two important West Kootenay communities. The CRT is a non-motorized route that follows 11km of unpaved road segments and 7km of single-track trail. Minimal elevation gain is experienced on this trail as it follows the shore of the Columbia River. The trail is suitable for walking, cycling and equestrian use. Some sections are unsuitable for touring cyclists and are better suited for mountain bikers.",
    "directions": "From the end of Columbia Road in Ootischenia, across the river from Castlegar, to the water tower in Sunningdale, a community of Trail, is a distance of 25km. From the recently constructed picnic site at the former Doukhobor settlement of Blagodatnoye  to the water tower in Sunningdale is an 18km trip.",
