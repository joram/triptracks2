    "description": "The trail itself is varied and intense like most mountain passes. \r\rI started out from Spray Lake road and ended up on the opposite side between a golf course and a wall of bush. The route down is tough, the trail peters out eventually, but you'll never lose your way as long as your continue to descend through the bush. No need for fancy pants on this hike. Bring plenty of water or a pot to boil your own.",
    "directions": "Take the route from downtown to the Nordic Center. From here you'll need to continue to the top of the road and continue until you pass the lake on the right. The trail head is on the left between the Three Sisters and the range of mountains to your left.",
