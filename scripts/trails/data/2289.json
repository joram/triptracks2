    "description": "A great trail for both hiking and snowshoeing.  The difficulty increases quite a bit in the snow with deep drifts common ...but that's part of the fun!  Trail starts in Whistler, near Creekside, and winds up through the water shed to a great \"tunnel\" of trees (therefore the name) and continues south and west towards Function Junction.  This route returns you to Spring Creek subdivision where you can jump on the valley trail to return or catch a bus back to Whistler.  Depending on the snow it can be a good 3 hour snowshoe or if no snow a 1.5 hour hike.",
    "directions": "From the south turn right onto Bayshores (which is the second light coming\r\ninto Whistler from Vancouver). Turn right again onto Cheakamus Way and\r\nfollow it for about 1km until you see tennis courts on the left just by the\r\n4 way stop. Turn towards the tennis courts and park in the parking area. The\r\nvalley trail starts there so follow it up curving to the right and shortly\r\nseeing a gate for the water shed. Don't go into the water shed, but continue\r\nup the road, past the water tank and then turn left. Just up the hill you'll\r\nfind the trail entrance to the right.",
