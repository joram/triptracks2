    "description": "NTS Map: 082J11Great little loop, great for beginner snowshoe users.  The loop as defined is 5.5km.  but there is some interesting side trips you can make while exploring that can add a few more kms on.  If desired, there's a 30m hike down to cross a creek on a bridge which makes it interesting.  Watch for the fresh signs of Moose in the area.An interesting feature you should be able to find is the wooden pipeline and all related hardware.  All the leaks in the pipeline make for some great ice sculptures (and icy terrain).NOTE:  (07Jan14) Newly attached GPS data is for entire trail.",
    "directions": "Drive to Peter Lougheed Provincial Park (50 km S of Hiway 1 on Hiway 40) and into the Canyon Day Use area (about 5 km into park on right).  Trail starts on North end of lot.",
