    "description": "Esplanade is a community diverse in vegetation and habitat. To maintain this naturally sensitive area, trail users should stay on formal trails.These trails provide better accessibility, improve habitat for plants and wildlife, and create physical barriers in the event of a grass fire.The trail runs along Okanagan Lake and leads to the Trans-Canada Trail and 3Mile beach(3Mile also has a C/O section just past the large willow tree on the north end if anyone is interested).Nice nature hike or mountain bike trail.Bike shop and rentals at: Freedom Bike Shop in Penticton.Accomodations: Summerland Resort (10 minutes north of Penticton) on the lake.",
    "directions": "Head for the Penticton Yacht Club (on the North East end of Penticton) the trail is at the south end of the Yacht Club can't miss the sign. Lots of parking.",
