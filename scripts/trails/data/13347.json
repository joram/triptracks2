    "description": "The Chiganois River has many great falls on the East Branch (see trailpeak post or my waterfall guide) and another great slot canyon (Sam Higgins falls on trailpeak) and so I decided to explore the western branch to see if there was anything to see there.  \nThe gps track shows my route that day\u2026I started with a revisit to the falls on the eastern branch and then instead of retracing my steps, I followed the western branch to get back to my car.  I had already explored the lower part of the western branch on another occasion so I bypassed it this time (there was a nice gorge but not fall).  The western branch does contain some falls and some tributaries also contain falls but there are nothing really tall but still nice enough to check after the east branch falls.",
