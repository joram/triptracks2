    "description": "Sometimes you can't get out of the city but still need to get outdoors and  explore seldom visited areas.  This hike will take you to such a place.  An urban oasis that thousands of people drive by every day in Dartmouth and Cole Harbour.  The hike takes place around Bell Lake.  Most of the shoreline is a protected HRM parkland while a small portion is taken up by a local paddling club.  \nYou can basically walk the entire shoreline except for the boat club frontage on some unofficial, unkept trail.  The rewards of this hike are numerous.  Lots of blackberry bushes and small beach areas that look promising for a impromptu swim.  There is only a small area that seems to be overs used by litterbugs but the rest of the trails are pretty much clean for an urban environment.  Most of the forest is a mixture of hardwoods and conifers and there are at least 3 different geocaches to find.",
