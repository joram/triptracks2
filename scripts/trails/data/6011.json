    "description": "This trail will lead you up to Grass Lake in the Sea to Sea Green Belt Park Reserve. The lake is quite lovely and there is even an canoe up there for anybody to use. I know you folks on here are good people but please put it back and do not vandalize it please! There are also historical artifacts along the trail such as an old chimney and an old car wreck. Please note that there are no facilities in this park. Bring ample food and water for all members in your group. DO NOT HIKE ALONE! Enjoy the hike!",
    "directions": "Head west along the Sooke Highway (Rte. 14) and turn right just after the fire hall on Harbourview Road. Continue right to the end where there is a very obvious CRD parking lot.",
