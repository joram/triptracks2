    "description": "Trail I describe is to the first Summit Lake, this is because I was pulling my son in a carrier and after the first lake it's single track. Great trail, wide with great views all around 360. Beautiful Beaver Lake at 2 km. A great trail for the whole family. Very little elevation gain, about 50m only.",
    "directions": "Trailhead is at the Jaques Lake parking area on the east end of Medicine Lake on the Maligne Lake Road in Jasper National Park..",
