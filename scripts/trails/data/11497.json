    "description": "The hike consists of dirt trails. Overall the elevation gain is very steady and consistent with only a few portions that are steeper and a few flatter portions. The trail is well used and might get slippery when wet, poles might be required. The top is marked by a canadian flag and a pile of rocks. There are no trees on top and you can get a great view. We have done the trail with a one year old in a backpack carrier and had no difficulties. It is quite a workout with a child.",
    "directions": "Park across highway 66 from powderface trail head parking lot. There is a small pathway on the west side of the highway leading north. You will pass a small creek with a big culvert. The trail heads off to the left and isn't marked.",
