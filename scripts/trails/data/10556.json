    "description": "I think this is a better bike trail than a hiking trail. From the Mount Norquay \rparking lot you can hike to the summit. The distance to the summit is 2,2 \rkilometres (one-way) with a total climb of 182 metres. The view of the valley \rand Banff is pretty impressive. If you hike or bike the trail all the way to \rhighway #1 you are going to have to find your way back to the summit.\r\rThe elevation gain of 487 metres noted above is from highway #1 to the \rsummit. The total trail, Mount Norquay parking lot to Highway #1 is 8.7 \rkilometres.",
    "directions": "Take Highway #1 to Banff and exit Highway #1 onto Mount Norquay Scenic \rDrive. Drive to the Mount Norquay Parking Lot. The trailhead is at the south \rend of the parking lot almost immediately after you turn off of Mount \rNorquay Scenic Drive.",
