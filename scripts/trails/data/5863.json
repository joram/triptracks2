    "description": "This loop consisted of Tabegauche, Eagles Wing (up but would be more fun down), then Holy Cross down. Start by riding up from the parking lot along on either the Tabegauche double-track, or Eagles Wing if  you want to work. Gain some elevation, and drop back down on Holy Cross -- which is a super fun but very technical trail -- not for the faint of heart.  Another option is Lemon Squeezer down, over rolling mounds.  Also some steep sections.\nThere are easier loops, and, you'll find lots of flow and great singletrack, with a different geography again from Bookcliffes and Kokopelli areas.  The blue-green cryptobiotic mounds were pretty cool (at least for a Canadian), and, the single-track here is fantastic.  You'll get an aerobic workout because it's up for quite a while from the main (lower) parking lot.  Because there is an upper parking lot, you can bet shuttling is popular with the locals. \nYour brain will enter it's own space as you lose the cares of the world and you pedal the slop up (if you are an XC rider).  Once you reach the main hub, you can continue to climb (no time for me) to trails like Ribbon, or loop back on one of the more intermediate trails, or, take Holy Cross.  Holy sh*t, what a trail.  I'd say it's been well built and maintained, Holy Cross has some built-in features yet it feels natural.  \nI would love to return and do more here.  If anyone else has more information, please use the trail wiki to add more or click add trail to add an entirely new trail description (e.g. Ribbon).",
