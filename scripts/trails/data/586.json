    "description": "NTS Map: 052E14 / 052E11\r\nThe Hunt Lake trailhead is located east of West Hawk Lake, and ends at a small shelter (no overnight camping) at Little Indian Bay.\r\n\r\nLocated in the Canadian Shield Region, the trail provides some scrambling up steep cliffs, and some degree of bushwacking.  Most of the trail skirts West Hawk Lake, and provides some great views, and an opportunity to take a dip on a hot day!\r\n\r\nTrail maintenance is usually good, but we encountered several trees down along the way. The usual precautions against a yogi encounter are advisable.",
    "directions": "Take Hwy 1 east from Winnipeg to West Hawk Lake, and turn right at the town intersection. Follow the road through the town past the beach and boat launch. The trailhead sign is on the left just before the gates to a maintenance road.\r",
