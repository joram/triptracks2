    "description": "20 min of continuous climb along a seismic line leads to the alpine and several small lakes. For trail map / more information, visit: chetoutdoors websiteNote: this is not a developed trail. Follow flagging tapes / carry a GPS.",
    "directions": "From Chetwynd, take Hwy 97 towards Prince George for 24.8 km. Turn left onto the Westcoast Forest Service Road. This is a radio controlled road, and having a radio is strongly advised. Drive for 9 km to a fork and turn right onto the Hasler Road. Drive another 38 km and then turn right onto Boulder Road. Drive another 10.4 km where the road ends at a gas well. Walk across the wet marsh and up a seismic line into the alpine. As of yet there is no signage, but there is orange flagging along the trail.",
