    "description": "At the trailhead, turn immediately left (look for the brown sign on the left side of the trail, immediately upon passing the gate). If you go straight, you will wind up doing the Fern Cascade walk.The trail climbs a burned hill, continues through spruce and fir forests, then, after approx. 2.5 kms, is flat all the way to Lone Star geyser. Lone Star geyser is very reliable at 3 hour intervals. We missed it by approx. 15 minutes, and didn't want to wait the 2.75 hours before he next eruption. It is also unique in being so isolated (no crowds), and looks like a large fossilized tree stump of approx. 3m. in diameter, and approx 4 m high. Apparently the eruptions vary from 3 to 15 metres high.You can either return the same way, or continue on the paved Lone Star Geyser trail approx 3 kms back to the hway. You'll be approx 2 kms from the Howard Eaton trailhead, which you can return to along the highway (downhill walk) or try hitch hiking back.",
    "directions": "Drive south on US Hway 89 approx 1 km past Old Faithful geyser, look for the pedestrian crosswalk and the rumble strips on the road. You'll see the Howard Eaton sign on the south side of the road, with parking for 4-5 cars.At the trailhead, turn immediately left (look for the brown sign on the left side of the trail, immediately upon passing the gate). If you go straight, you will wind up doing the Fern Cascade walk.",
