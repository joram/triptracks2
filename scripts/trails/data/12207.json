    "description": "This is a hike on the coast of Yarmouth to a couple of large rocks standing alone in a field.  One of the rocks has some carvings on it; a cross and some leaves.  there are many theories on who has carved those .....just google it.   The walk is super easy and mostly falt as you make your way from a barrier beach to the field.",
    "directions": "Drive towards Yarmouth Bar and turn right on churn Rd.  Park at the end and hike in an eastern direction along the shore.  You should be able to spot the rocks from the parking",
