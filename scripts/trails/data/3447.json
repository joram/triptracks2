    "description": "An easy hike through the forest of Whiteshell Provincial Park.  The trail can be taken as a loop.  The rapids, a small cabin with a wood stove, and numerous picnic areas are found about 3 km in.  In the summer the rapids are fun to slide down.  In the winter, the trail makes a peaceful ski or snowshoe.  Great for families.  Atfer the rapids, there is a short 3km loop that can extend the trail.",
    "directions": "On the north side of highway 307 in Whiteshell Provincial Park, past Nutimik Lake and the petroforms.  Watch for the trailhead and parking area (hard to miss) about 5 or so km east past Nutimik.",
