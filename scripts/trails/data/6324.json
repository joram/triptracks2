    "description": "Floe Lake is a small lake set beneath a rock wall escarpment in Kootenay National Park. Right around it's shores there is an alpine larch forest. There is back country campground at the Lake.\nThe first 7 km of the hike are relatively easy, but the next 3 km to the lake is about 30% up hill climb. The entire area was burned in July 2003 by the Tokumm - Verendrye Creek fire. So most of the trip is through burned forest where re growth is slowly starting to happen.\nI was hoping to see more larch trees in colour but due to fact most of trip is through the burned area only trees in colour were right at the lake. \nNote: there is another description of this trail that includes going further over Rock Wall Pass.\nNote: also the GPS data attached doesn't quite make it to the campground, it was getting late on a fall day so I quit at first view of the lake.",
