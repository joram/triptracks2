    "description": "Time and distance are for a return trip.Also known as the Humber Valley Trail, this is a good family trail just outside of Corner Brook toward Steady Brook.  There seem to be 3 destinations along the trail. The first is at a small lake, the second is at the high point of the trail and the third is further north at the end of the trail.Although the trail does get a bit steep at times, for the most part it's do-able for any reasonably fit hiker, just go slow on the steep parts. This trail is actually part of the International Appalacian Trail network and off excellent views of Corner Brook and the Humber Vally.We did this trail in early august and 2 varieties of orchid - Yellow Lady Slipper and Pink Lady Slipper. Orchids are extremely sensitive to human interference so please DON'T PICK THE ORCHIDS.",
    "directions": "The trailhead of Humber Valley Trail is located near Ballam Bridge at the entrance to Corner Brook?s Riverside Drive and the Bay of Island?s north shore highway, Admiral Palliser?s Trail, Route 440.N48 57.226 W57 53.165.",
