    "description": "On a July trip to Moncton, I was taken to this trail system located near the University of Moncton. I've called it the Halls Creek trail, because it hugs the slopes along the creek.\nThis is a terrific urban trail. It appears to have received much work and creativity, due to the elaborate single track and wooden structures. From what I saw in the summer of '09 the wood structures needed some work. I'm not one to ride those things anyway, but the single track was a blast. We accessed the trail from a logging road, finding entry points along the left side of the log road. The trail exists between the log road and th creek. \nWe didn't manage to ride the whole system, but found the nature of the trail to be varying in difficulty, which is nice for riders of all levels. There were plenty of switchbacks, with the route taking great advantage of space along the creek's banks.",
