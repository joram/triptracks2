    "description": "This is one of the most beautiful hikes you will ever do. Located in Garibaldi Park, between Squamish and Whistler BC, you will rise approx 1000 m to Taylor Meadows, followed by a visit to beautiful Garibaldi Lake itself, with views of Black Tusk, Sphynx Glacier, Panorama Ridge, etc...At the 6.5 point, go left to Taylor Meadows (approx 1.5 km), then follow the trail towards Black Tusk. DON'T make the mistake of turning right at the cabin and taking the shortcut to Garibaldi Lake. You'll miss the most beautiful part of the trail through the wild flower beds. There is camping at Taylor Meadows, but also lots of bugs in July and early August. Mid August was quite good.2 kms further, at the major intersection for Black Tusk, Garibaldi Lake and other parts, go approx 300 m further on the trail towards Black Tusk and enjoy more wild flowers than you can imagine (see photos). Have lunch while admiring the flowers and the views.Head back south the 300 m to the intersection and go east to Garibaldi Lake. Don't just look at  the lake from above, go right down to the picnic and camping area at the lake. Some people even swim in it: VERY refreshing. There's great camping here, but it usually fills up early, in which case you'll have to camp at Taylor Meadows.Your hike back to the parking lot can be done in approx 2 hours (9 kms, downhill).Beware, this is BEAR country, especially in the Taylor Meadows area.",
    "directions": "Approx 25 kms north of Squamish, turn right on the Garibaldi Park / Garibaldi Lake (Black Tusk) road. It's only 3 kms to the trail head. Parking fees apply in summer.",
