    "description": "NTS Map:082j14Elevation Gain: ~450 m (1,475 ft) from Galatea Creek, 259 m (850 ft) from Ribbon CreekGuinn's Pass is more of a connector than an actual trail on its own. This trail connects the  Ribbon Falls- Buller Pass with the  Galatea Creek trail.The trail from Ribbon Lake climbs steeply 470 vertical metres to the pass. At 1.2km there is a junction with the Buller Pass trail. Turn left for Guinn's Pass. The climb is strenuous but the views are spectacular. After you meet the Galatea Creek trail, turn left to return to Hwy 40, or right to visit Lillian Lake and the Galatea Lakes. From the junction it's only 0.9km to the campground at the far end of Lillian Lake, another 1.2km to the Galatea Lakes.",
    "directions": "Ribbon Lake campground or Buller Pass trailhead on the Spray Lakes/Smith-Dorrien road. From that trailhead it's 8.1km over Buller Pass to the junction of this trail and 1.2km further to Ribbon Lake campground.",
