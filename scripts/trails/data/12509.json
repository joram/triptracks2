    "description": "I had heard about some new climbing routes near Musquodoboit Harbour.   There is a small, tapped, trail that leads over the top of a small ridge. The trials out in the open and surrounded by blueberry bushes.  Once on the top of the hill, you can look across towards the east and spot some of the trails off the railway.   Looking west, the trail splits in two.  One leads to the top of the crag while the other to the bottom.  The bottom of the cliffs are well protected in an evergreen forest.  There are some bolts for some routes but there are lots more unclimbed faces.",
    "directions": "Highway 357 North.  turn on Byermills Rd, cross the river and turn left on Byers Lake Rd.  There is a small parking area about 200m from the end on your left.  Park there and find the flagging tape and trail.",
