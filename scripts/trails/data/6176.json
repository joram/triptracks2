    "description": "We really don't know the name of this trail - it's a brutal 320m climb in 2.6km up a loose gravel road but at the top ... sweet, sweet DH flowing like blissy butter through the trees.  Winnie the Pooh comes to mind, I don't know why, maybe I shouldn't write trail reviews after 3 pints and riding home without headlights.\nI digress.  Anyways, the ride starts up a closed-to-the-public (vehicles) oil field access road where you will spend at least 40 minutes grinding up the gravel.  Look on the left side of the road for the poorly marked trailhead just before an orange survey lathe although I suspect the trailhead will get more noticeable soon.  It is pretty much exactly 2.4km from the gate, about 3.1 from the parking lot.\nThe DH sections is nothing too too technical, but really well laid-out, flowey, nicely cut in and packed down.  There are two smallish jumps about 1/3 of the way down, and a couple areas with some loose gravel.  An XC bike would be fine, an all-mountain bike would be cushy.\nCurrent conditions:",
    "directions": "Ing's Mine Trailhead, about 5km West of Station Flats, or about 16.1km West of the Hiway 22/22X corner South of Bragg Creek.  As you pull off the highway, look to your left at a big gated road saying Husky something or other.  You have to ride up that road, but the parking area is 500m in front of you.  Park.  Ride.  Repeat.",
