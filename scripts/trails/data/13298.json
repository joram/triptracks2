    "description": "This is a hike to a series of smaller falls set in a very nice looking ravine near Cape George.  Setting off alongside the stream, the forest is not easy to bushwack and the land is very flat.  After a while, you cross over an area that has been recently logged.  The bushwack after is no fun either.  A better way is to go to higher elevation and then come back to the stream where the fall is located.  I couldn?t do that as I wasn?t sure if there was a fall at all on this stream.  Lucky for you, I found one and here is its location;  N45\u00b0 51' 08.7\" W61\u00b0 58' 15.4\"",
    "directions": "Highway 337 from Maligant cove towards Cape George.  The stream to follow crosses the highway at;  N45\u00b0 51' 14.1\" W61\u00b0 59' 02.1\".  Follow it upstream.",
