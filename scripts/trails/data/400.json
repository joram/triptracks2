    "description": "Your escape into the wild can be fulfilled on this hike. It definitely doesn't have North Shore urban hoard appeal. Not that I'm dissing  Mt.Seymour, Hollyburn/Cypress and Grouse --those are all great destinations --but to see fewer people there you have to get up early to hit the trails. Alouette Mountain differs in that it's a bit further east geographically, but less of a drive than to Squamish, offers great alpine views, and is less traveled.",
    "directions": "From Vancouver head east on the Lougheed Highway; turn off heading north on 232nd Street and follow the signs into Golden Ears Provincial Park. Pass the goat entrance sign ..(this is a pretty obvious locator (no GPS needed here) because in the summer foreign tourists congregate here to photograph themselves much like they do at the totem poles in Stanley Park). pass the sign and turn left after 4 kilometres toward the Park Headquarters and keep left to Mike Lake. Park after 2 kilometres at the bottom of the Incline Trail (250 metres elevation). Take time and hike through the second growth at an even pace. The forest is great and will give you a chance to marvel at the occasional cedar or hemlock that escaped the original logging before the creation of the park in 1927. The Incline Trail occasionally intersects a fire access road that switchbacks up the flank of Alouette Mountain. This road is used by equestrian and mountain bike traffic in small numbers, so pay heed and give them the right of way. After about 6.5 kilometres (732m elevation) the trail branches left down to 'Lake Beautiful' keep attentive for old growth in this area and see how different it is from the regenerated forest.  Continue on the trail for another 2.5 kilometres and gain another 600 metres vertical and you'll be standing on the summit of Alouette Mountain. Do this hike; it's well worth the effort.Other information:Elevation Gain - 1100 metresHigh point - 1371 metresTopographic Map\tStave Lake  92 G8 Port Coquitlam  92 G7\t\tBC Parks Map\tGolden Ears Provincial Park   Park Headquarters\t",
