    "description": "Varied type of hike with level & hilly sections, trees and open areas. Some sections are narrow with a very steep slope on both sides but, a good trail.",
    "directions": "Ellision Park has a spiderweb of trails and something can be found for everyone. This route is a combination of some of those trails and does leave the park. Driving south on OK Landing Road, continue out to just be fore the entrance to Ellison Park's campground. About 200 meters before the campground entrance, there is a gravel parking area on the left. There is a yellow barricade which is just about always left open. Park and on the right you will see a a trail. Follow that for about 25 meters and on your right you will see a trail. Take that trail and follow it for about 200 meters and then follow the trail on the left.\r\rThis trail has a steady climb then levels out. If you follow the GPS map I have listed, you will see I have tried to make each branch in the trail. I have walked down each side trail a few meters to show it and have marked way-points. The end result of following the GPS map is you end up going south and will climb over 300 meters. I have not followed the trail to the end yet but, it seems to drop down from where I marked and either ends up at Okanagan Lake or up to Commanage road. Warning: There is an older gentleman that hikes this area nude. Loves hiking, hates clothes but is safe and friendly.\r\rSetting a brisk pace: Moving time 2:12, total time 2:39, average speed 4.4km, elevation gain 373 meters.",
