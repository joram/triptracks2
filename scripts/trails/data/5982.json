    "description": "An all season walking/hiking/skiing trail loop along the north side of the North Saskatchewan River (NSR) through Sir Wilfred Laurier Park.  Enter the loop at any location.  There is plenty of parking at the Valley Zoo and the Edmonton Rowing Club areas.  The trail may be undertaken in either direction ? as described below the trail follows a clockwise direction starts at an arbitrary trail head..  This trail is a good cross skiing route in the winter.",
    "directions": "From downtown Edmonton head west along Jasper Avenue to 124 street and then continue west along 102nd that turns into Stony Plain Road.  At 142nd street turn left and travel south until reaching 91st Avenue.  Turn left to head east to Valley View Drive.  Turn south on Valley View Drive and follow it around to Valley View Crescent.  Upon joining the Crescent take the first available left turn and go 55 metres and enter an alley on the left to head east.  This is the trail head.  There is limited parking at this location although lots of parking at other locations along the route (try the Valley Zoo parking lot).",
