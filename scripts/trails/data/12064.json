    "description": "Beginning at Austin Pass, the Lake Ann Trail enters the Mount Baker Wilderness as it switchbacks down into the headwaters of the Swift Creek Drainage. Bordered by Shuksan Arm to the north and Artist Ridge to the south, you will travel through meadows and wooded areas. Approximately 2.5 miles from the trailhead is a signed junction with  Swift Creek Trail #607.As you begin to climb out of the Swift Creek drainage through heather, talus slopes and subalpine forest, Mt. Baker comes into view. You will reach a saddle above Lake Ann. Dropping down toward the lake, you will encounter an unsigned junction. The left fork leads to the popular Fisher Chimneys route for climbers attempting to summit Mt. Shuksan. The right fork leads to lakeside campsites.Lake Ann hikers are rewarded with up-close views of Mt. Shuksan and its Lower and Upper Curtis Glaciers. Listen for the thunderous roar that means a chunk of ice has broken off one of the glaciers and is tumbling down the rock face.",
    "directions": "Travel east to the end of Mt. Baker Highway SR 542. It is approximately 23 miles from the Glacier Public Service Center to the Lake Ann trailhead and parking lot. The parking lot is located on the left (east) side of SR 542 one mile before Artist Point.",
