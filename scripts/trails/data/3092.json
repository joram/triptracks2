    "description": "Located 1.6 kilometres east of the Visitor\r\n Centre. A 500-metre walk from the parking areas provides a\r\n view of these scenic waterfalls. An alternative access trail\r\n starts at the Robson Meadows Campground and follows the\r\n Fraser River to the falls.\r\n\r\nThe Fraser river plunges into a large pool at these falls. The roar of the falls can be heard all along the trail. This is the final stop for those few Chinook salmon that manage to get this far from the ocean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r",
