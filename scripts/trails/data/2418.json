    "description": "This cross-country loop will  avoid the black diamond Pump House Plunge for those \"Wheels on The Ground\" types like me. The relentless hills on the Mamquam FSR will get your blood pumping on the way up and the sometimes loose downhill on the Rip will keep you on your toes. Miss the turn at 9 mile like us and you may end up at an 800 meter ridge that will use up your extra energy in a hurry.\r\nBonk Hill will warm you up when you leave your vehicle with a nice steady 3.8 kilometer burn.\r\nSome nice views to be had and we had some fresh snow at the start of the Rip. \r\nAll in all a great ride. \r",
    "directions": "Park at Westray Ave and Plateau Dr. in Squamish, aprox N49 42.323 W123 07.158. The trail starts there, just follow the track onto the Mamquam FSR.",
