    "description": "Trail starts off going through treed areas with slight elevation gain and after about 3k opens to a beautiful valley, Extreme uphill commences after that. Trail seems to almost disapear after crossing the last saddle and starts heading down to the first lake. Fairly steep descent. Once down, take the trail down to the lakes at the other end and the fishing is unbelievable. Elevation gain is over 1 km. \nCurrent conditions:",
    "directions": "Get to Waterton National Park. On the Akamina Parkway head (north-west) about 6 km, to the Rowe Lakes parking lot. \nEditor's note - this trail follows the Rowe Meadow and Lineham Ridge trails as described elsewhere on Trailpeak. Once you gain Lineham Ridge, follow the ridge around to the north towards Mount Hawkins. Drop down to the lakes from this portion of the ridge. The return trip back up to the ridge is very difficult scree. The route as shown on the GPS map comes down off Lineham Cliff, also described on Trailpeak. Parks Canada considers any climbing on Lineham Cliff as a hazardous activity and requires climbers (up or down) to register with the information office. Hikers have died on this cliff in the past.",
