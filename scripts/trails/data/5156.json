    "description": "MacElmons Pond is definately the place to take a first time paddler. For flat water canoeing and kayaking, it's non-intimidating locale that contains a few nice features to paddle around. It has a small island with a narrow channel to paddle through, and an area on the opposite bank where the trail edges the shore, and you can pause and tie up for a snack.\nOn my visit there, when we were staying at Irwin Lake Chalets,  it was windy enough to only warrent a bit of time in the canoe when we were there. After a hike on the trail, we got the canoe in the water. with nice firm banks, the dog hopped in with little trepedation, and we were off for only a small loop around the inner third of the pond. \nAfter that, we racked up the boat and headed for home!\nshannon Burt\nEast Coast editor",
