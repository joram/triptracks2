    "description": "An 11.5 km hike on a gravel, access road to the communication towers on top of the mountain. It is on private property and the owner allows only service vehicles to go up the mountain. Hikers are welcome as long as the stick to the road. From the top you'll be rewarded with stunning views of Kelowna and the Okanagan Valley. 360 degree view from Big White to Silverstar to Terrace Mountain and Okanagan Mountain.Park alongside HWY 33 and start hiking up PYMAN RD. There is a gate there, just before the new gravelpit, but it is not always closed. Don't drive up or you could find yourself locked in.For the first 2 km you hike on a gentle grade uphill over Okanagan grasslands. When you get to the crest of the hill take the left fork (KM 1.5). The right gravel road leads to another gravel pit so don't take that. From here it gets a little flatter. The vegetation changes to fir and cedar trees and higher up to tamarack trees. This is the backside (northeast side) of the mountain and in contrast to the dry southside of the mountain. At the small pond take the left fork again. From here it goes gently uphill and after 4 switchbacks the road level out again at the top. The top is 1287 meters with several communication towers. Its a little cooler up there when it is to hot in the Okanagan Valley.",
    "directions": "From the Junction of HWY 97 with HWY 33 in Kelowna, drive 10 km up towards BigWhite. Look for \"PYMAN RD\". Park alongside HWY 33. Hike up Pyman Road.",
