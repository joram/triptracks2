    "description": "Easy trail access and walking throughout the duration of the trail.  There may be a few areas that may experience some flooding during the early parts of the spring season as they were close to the riverbeds.  Trail winds near the Bonnechere river where there are many places to pinch in canoes, also there are few cabins in the area for rent towards the Northern portion of the trail.",
    "directions": "Loop trail within Bonnechere Provincial Park Campground near the front entrance.",
