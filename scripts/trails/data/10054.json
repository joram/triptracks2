    "description": "Nice Trail that moves you up to the side of the Mt Baldy Ski area.\r\rThe trail is fairly wide and very good footing. It looks like it may be an old road. The trail starts on by passing the power line and then into a older clear cut. It makes it's way through a nicely forested area and climbs in and out of the forested area. \r\rThere is no water on the trail nor is there cell service. One can either go back down the trail or shuttle a car for the Baldy ski area to the trail head.",
    "directions": "Travel east of Oliver on the well marked road to the mount baldy resort.\rThe trail head is about 3 km's before the final Y in the road before the turn to Mt Baldy. \r\rThe trail head can be a little tricky to find the first time so a GPS is handy. The key thing to look for is where the large powerline intercepts the highway.",
