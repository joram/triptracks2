    "description": "This is a pleasant hike along a creek that flows through Port Alberni. Historically, Roger Creek was the source of drinking water in the early days of Alberni, the older of the two communities that have now amalgamated into Port Alberni. There are still remnants of the engineering visible in places along the creek. The second growth forest and riparian vegetation is getting fairly old now. Once you get past the junction with the Log Train Trail, the path gets a little rougher. But the sight get More interesting. there are some unique shale cliffs on the other side of the creek, a nice little swimming hole, a big tree called the Roger Creek Giant and a unique little bridge where you can see some old cement steps from the old water system. It's a great way to escape the heat on a hot summer Alberni afternoon.",
    "directions": "Take the left fork as you drive westward past the Visitor Information Centre.  Drive 1.4 km until you see a small clearing on your left. There is a sign with a trail map on it.",
