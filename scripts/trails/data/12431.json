    "description": "This is one of those falls that is so far tucked away off a logging road that I guess only a handful of people have ever seen it.  The logging road btw are in pretty good shape almost the whole way and the track for this hike shows the trip in the car as well as the hike itself to the fall.   Basically you park at the gas pipeline ROW.  You set forth in an eastern direction following the pipeline and soon you come up to McDonald Brook lying in a depression.  Follow the brook downstream for about 200m to a two tier waterfall (total height is maybe 25ft).  The lower one is the largest.  the terrain once you hit the stream is very dense and not the most fun to go through but the reward and the short distance makes it palatable.",
