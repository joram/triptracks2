    "description": "This is a fall to a place I had only visited in the winter.   In winter the falls are completely buried by snow.  Luckily the rains we had on February 2016 left these falls clear of snow in early March.  The way there, I traversed some logged area and some pretty thick brush.  However on my way back, I just followed a kidder track all the way back to the dirt road....way easier!!!!!!!",
    "directions": "Park at the end of Perrin Dr in Fall River and walk the dirt road to the skidded track at N44 50 07.0 W63 33 53.8 and follow it almost all the way to the fall...the least 100m you have to bushwhack to the fall at N44 49 40.7 W63 33 45.4",
