    "description": "NTS Map: 082G10This trail takes you from Alberta EAST to B.C. (thanks to a jog in the border). The \"promised land\" on the B.C. side is actually a rather barren moonscape. One attraction for spelunkers is the upper entrance to the Gargantua Caves, at about 8,000 feet elevation. You can hike or bike about 7 kilometers, then stash bikes for a quite difficult climb. Camp on edge of timberline on Alberta side; next day hike over saddle to B.C. Usually water is available in trickles above camp site, but just in case take extra water with you.",
    "directions": "About a klick east of B.C. border turn south on gravel road. Several K's up road it forks, the left fork is an immediate ford. Leave vehicles there, ford the creek (first of several fords) and away you go. Bike in mostly easy; one difficult hill to push bikes up. Bike out is a biker's delight.",
