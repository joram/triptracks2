    "description": "A relatively easy trail, very suitable for someones first foray into true off-road mountain-biking.  100m of difference in elevation, a couple hills required some pushing for some people (who will remain nameless).\nNote: The 'bible' of MTB (Backcountry Biking in the Canadian Rockies by Doug Eastcott) calls this Sibbald Flats, but all the Kananaskis Country maps call this the north end of Tom Snow.  And there is a different, short trail called 'Sibbald Flat' on K-co maps starting from the Sibbald Lake trailhead.\nYou can start from the Dawson end or the other end, that being the Spruce Woods Rec area.  Spruce Woods is located on the South Demonstration Forest Loop and features some picnic tables up top.  Oddly most of our group decided to eat their lunch down by the river,  thus missing the opportunity of cardio/skill training and extra 23m of climbing.\nYou could make a loop of it only if you want to ride down the dry, dusty Hiway 68 (gravel at that point), so it will probably be an out & back with an optional sideleg.\nThere is some singletrack (near the Dawson trailhead end), opening into some double track and some open meadows.\nA fun ride if you're not hardcore.  All creek crossings are bridged, if it wasn't for a couple mud puddles, we'd be dry.\nThis trail is in the general area of:",
    "directions": "Head west of Calgary on Hiway 1 to the well marked Hiway 68 (Sibbald Creek Trail) exit (about 17.5km past hiway 22 overpass).\nDrive South/West along #68 for 23km to the well marked Powderface Trail gravel road.\nGo south 3km to the Dawson Provincial Recreation Area parking lot.  Park there.\nTrailhead is in North-East corner of parking lot right beside where you come in.",
