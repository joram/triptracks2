    "description": "EDITOR'S NOTE - this description seems to be inaccurate, see the review posted below.\nRing Lake is a pristine and remote wilderness lake; currently, less than 25 people per year visit its shores. The lake sits at an elevation of 1,664 metres. The 5 kilometre hike takes about three hours and gains 330 metres of elevation from the lodge. The hike begins with an easy walk through a series of flat meadows.  The difficulty level increases and the trail gets more rustic on the final push to the alpine.  The spectacular views of Mt. Callaghan, Ring Mountain and picturesque Ring Lake make it well worth the effort.",
    "directions": "From Downtown Vancouver (approx. 1 1/2 hrs.) Drive towards Stanley Park on Georgia Street. Follow the Stanley Park Causeway across the Lion?s Gate Bridge. On the north side of the bridge, keep left and follow the cloverleaf under the bridge towards West Vancouver. Turn right at the first set of lights onto Taylor Way. Follow\nTaylor Way to the top of the hill and turn left at the lights immediately after driving under a big overpass (this is the highway). You will now be on the on-ramp to the Trans-Canada Highway (#1). Continue along Hwy #1 and follow the signs to Highway 99. From Vancouver to Whistler is about 1.5 hours, depending on traffic and road conditions. About 30 minutes past Squamish, you will pass Brandywine Falls Provincial Park. The turnoff to Callaghan Country is about 5 minutes past this park on the left hand side. You will see a sign announcing the Callaghan Valley Recreation Areas and another sign announcing Whistler Olympic Park as the 2010 Olympic Nordic venue. Turn left here. Follow the paved Callaghan Valley access road about 8.5km. You will see our sign on your left. Turn left and cross the bridge over Madeley Creek (If you arrive at Whistler Olympic Park, you?ve gone too far!) Follow the Callaghan Lake Forest Service Road to Callaghan Lake. It is about 8.5km from the Callaghan Country base to Callaghan Lake on a rough road and it takes about 30 ? 45 minutes. A vehicle with good clearance (4WD preferred) is recommended. The trail to the lodge begins about 250m before you reach the lake ? look for the sign on your left. There is a small clearing just off the road ? park here.  From here take the Callaghan Lake to Callaghan Lodge (Conflict Lake) Trail to the Ring Lake Trail Head.",
