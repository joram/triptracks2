    "description": "I've done portions of this trail to maximize the amount that I could get covered in only a few days.\r\rI started on the northern part of the coastal trail off of Gargantua Road. The road is about 40km of dirt road. Graded enough so that even small cars can get through with carefull driving around the potholes and rocks.\r\rThere is a small parking lot with a good trail map and information board. Check before heading on the trails for any wildlife in the area notices.\r\rThe trail leading north to the backcountry campsites are wide and makes for an easy hike to get set up at one of the nearby campsites.\r\rThe campsites are located just off a beautiful beach with gorgeous sunset views.\r\rIf you settle in here and go exploring further north to Warp Bay, Devils Chair or Chalfant Cove, give yourself about 2-3 hours to return to your campsite. The trail gets fairly narrow after leaving Gargantua Harbour, but opens up with slight inclines. (keep your eyes open for bears)\r\rThe trail to Warp Bay gets a little tricky to follow after you cross the bridge, keep your eye's peeled for trail markers.\r\rThe southern most parts of the trail are well worn and see alot more usage by day-hikers. As well the more southern campsites feel alot less backcountry as you can still see/hear cars passing by on the nearby highway.\r\rOverall, great trails to explore. I would definately go back with a fellow hiker to help carry gear to hike the trail in its entirety.",
    "directions": "If travelling south from wawa, continue past the park border. The Park office will be on your left. \r\rContinue further south and you will see signage for Gargantua Road on the right.\r\rFollow throuh until the end of the road.\r\rThe entire park is well signed and decently mapped.",
