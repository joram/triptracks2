    "description": "The trail winds through lave flows, small lakes, a suspension bridge over a raging river, and occasional views of the Black Tusk, Daisy Lake and Brandywine Falls.  Do the loop clockwise to save the best views till the end.",
    "directions": "Same as Brandywine Falls (also on trailpeak.com - at least once).  Head up Hwy 99 from Vancouver (or down from Whistler).  Well marked off highway, close to Whistler.",
