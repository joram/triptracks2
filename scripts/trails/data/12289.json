    "description": "When traveling to an area in NS, I always check if there are some potential falls I have never seen.  the area near Yarmouth does not offer a lot of falls so my second source of explorations are old mine workings.Setting off there was an old road in the woods, the road continued in a direction I didn't want to continue on but as luck would have it a secondary atv path branched on the right.  I followed this to a tertiary foot path through the evergreen forest.  By now I am getting excited...looks like there is a path to the area I want to explore which means there must be good stuff to see there.Unfortunately the path ends  at the power line ROW at a deer stand!  Good thing I wasn't there in the fall!   I went across the row and entered the woods but seems like there was no path anymore.  The adit was located facing the small stream nearby ofa slight slope in the forest.  We did find the old adit but it had collapsed a while ago.  Returning to the car, I hiked through the forest immediately west of the adit (on the hill) and was pleasantly surprised by a mature deciduous forest.",
