    "description": "NTS Map: 083F05The Happy-Creek trail branches south off of the Hinton Town trails just south of Maxwell Lake.  For being so close to the town the trail has a feeling of being a true back-country hike.  The trail is not too difficult at all with only small hills.  In the spring the ice can make these slippery sometimes.Mountain biking will vary from moderate to difficult in some areas. The only real downside of this trail is that there is an ATV trail on the west side of the trail that parallels it for a good portion of its length.West Fraser (formerly Weldwood) has maps on their website for this and other trails in the area click here.The GPS data includes part of the town Trails  starting on the Robb road.  The waypoints include bridges and benches found along the trail.",
    "directions": "There are several ways to get there.  For the longest hike park your vehicle just outside the cemetery on the Robb Road about 1/2 kilometer south of the Hinton Training Centre.  The town trail is just south of the gate.  Follow the trail west until you see the Kiosk (which when we were there had nothing in it).  This is the start of the trail.  There is also a bridge about 100 metres past the Kiosk. You will finish about 100 metres on the other side of that bridge.",
