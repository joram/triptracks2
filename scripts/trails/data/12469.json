    "description": "The Fullerton loop is a lovely easy hike, child and novice friendly.  This hike extends the loop by incorporating Sugar Mama, one of the new West Bragg Creek trails.  It adds a little more distance and so is a good stepping stone.  The route follows the Fullerton Loop along the Elbow river, and takes the western part of that trail with all of its wonderful views of the Elbow Valley.  At about 3.5km you will come to a junction.  Take the north westerly route, leading up hill for about 200m to Bobcat.  At the top \"merge\" onto Bobcat, heading east and continue your gradual climbing.  Follow Bobcat for about 1 1/4 kms where you will see a sign in the trees indicating Sugar Mama.  Follow Sugar Mama south until its end, where it meets Elbow trail.  Follow this trail westerly until you find yourself at the start of the Fullerton Loop and thence onto the trailhead.",
    "directions": "Take highway 66 out of Bragg Creek towards Elbow Falls.  Park either in the Allen Bill day use area or on the other side of the highway in the Fullerton trailhead.",
