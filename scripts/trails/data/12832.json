    "description": "This is a hidden gem that people have a hard time locating.  The trail is easy and almost flat, leading to a couple of waterfalls.  At less than 3 KM return it's more of a stroll than a hike, although the trail to the upper falls is a bit rough -- bring mid-hikers, your ankles will thank you.I did this yesterday along with Lindeman in the 33 C heat & smoke. It feels much cooler once you get into the trees and very refreshing at the falls.  There are no flags on the way in, until you hit the forest -- just go through the ditch and follow the deactivated road around -- hooks left.I recommend mid-week as I only encountered two people on my way out of the trees.",
    "directions": "The trail head is about 2.7 KM from the Chilliwack Lake Park Gate. There's a pole on the left with 2017 painted on it -- in blue.  The entrance is at 49\u00b005'58.7\"N 121\u00b028'48.8\"W -- approximate street address is 63100 Chilliwack Lake Road. Map Link: https://goo.gl/vzWUYf",
