    "description": "This is a short loop that I did starting at the main Brother's creek access - head up the Brother's creek - continue pass the Baden Powell junction until you come to the second junction - this trail will lead you to Ballantree Park and Kildonan trails - It is well defined and in reasonable shape - When you come out on Kildonan drive head down the road for a few minutes and you will see the signpost for the Baden - Powell trail - climb up the stairs and follow this trail back to the junction with the Brother's Creek trail and then back to your starting point.\rThis is a short trip that is good for those lazy days when you don't want to do very much - the Brother's Creek trail is part of a historic forestry walking trail.",
    "directions": "Drive up to the top of the British Properties to Millstream Road not far from the Craigmont Sub station - note that there are some new parking signs at the trailhead - respect them or you may get towed.",
