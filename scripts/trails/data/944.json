Click on download GPS to see a mini-map. \r\n\r\nAlong the way, you will pass the first and second pump. There are BC Parks orange bamboo poles which lead to the first pump. The descent from the second peak to the summit is quite treacherous and crampons are recommended. The views from all three peaks are beautiful on a clear day.\r\n\r\nSee also this trailpeak entry for Seymour",
