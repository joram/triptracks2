    "description": "Part of the famous Test of Metal race in Squamish. Ride the 12km steep uphill on the Mamquam FSR and at the top of Lava Flow Hill turn left and fly down The Rip in your big ring for 6km and turn left and after 1km, the steep technical switchbacks of the Plunge will have your eyeballs a popping. Stop at a shelter at the trails end and check your shorts. You can ride out the way you came in by going left at the powerhouse or go right and end up on the Garabaldi Park road. The weather can be pretty haywire up on Lava Flow so bring a windbreaker and lots of fluids.",
    "directions": "Squamish is located about 1 hour north of Vancouver, on Hwy 99   \n( Sea to Sky HWY.)\nIf you are new to the area, your best bet is to go to Squamish and visit either the Tantalus Bike shop or Corsa Cycles. They will give you a map of all the great local trails. The best access to this ride is off of Westway Ave.in Valleycliffe, park and ride your bike thru Crumpit Woods(a real fun blast)for 30 minutes and start your adventure up the Mamquam FSR.",
