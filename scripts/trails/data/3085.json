    "description": "Another cool, old trail on Burke, built by Vic.  Bean is short and sweet, and will lead you into Nescafe, so the fun has just begun when you come out of the trees.  Another under-utilized hardtail pleasure.",
    "directions": "From the gate below the gunclub, follow the main logging road up Burke.  Take the second left.  This road is generally pedal-able if you are fit. Eventually (30 minutes)you will come to a fork with an open gate.  Take the left road for another 10-15minutes and keep your eyes peeled for a trail on the left.  There used to be a large coffee tin nailed to a tree, but I think it's gone now.  Look for a steep entrance with a right turn at the bottom.",
