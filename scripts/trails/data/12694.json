    "description": "These falls were adequately named as the Hidden Lake it runs from.  We explored it during the late winter and found the falls frozen (and immobile) in parts but decorative.  Looking forward to the Spring thaw to see the falls in their active splendor.Hidden Lake Falls is not far from Park Falls. Once you park your vehicle either at the bottom of the ATV road/trail entrance (across from 129 Park Falls Road) or if your vehicle can make 'er up the trail road, you can park your vehicle at the top of the clearing and then either use an ATV and/or walk the rest of the way.",
    "directions": "Traveling from New Glasgow (Pictou County): TransCanada Highway/NS-104 E towards Antigonish/Cape Breton. Take the exit toward Sherbrooke Rd/NS-347 S. Turn right onto Sherbrooke Rd/NS-347 S.  Turn left onto Park Falls Rd. There's an ATV road across the road from 129 Park Falls Road, turn right onto that ATV trail. You can either park at the bottom (off to the side as to not obstruct the laneway) or you can drive up to the clearing.",
