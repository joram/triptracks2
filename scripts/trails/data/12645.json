    "description": "The trailhead is just to the left of the upper bathrooms at the Heather Meadows Ski Area. There is almost always a well packed and defined trail and many snow shoers and skiers heading up along the path. The trail runs just to the West of the ski hill boundary along a ridge which runs to the East of a large bowl where many back country skiers head into. Eventually you will end up at artist point with amazing views of Mount Baker and Mount Shuksan. Table Mountain is to the right, while Huntoon Point, the current destination, is to the left. From Artist Point, it takes approximately 30-45 minutes to get to Huntoon Point. Approximately 415 m elevation gain from Heater Meadows parking lot.",
    "directions": "Take Mount Baker Highway (542) and follow to the end of the plowed road at Heather Meadows (upper ski hill parking). Trail starts at the left side of the upper bathrooms.",
