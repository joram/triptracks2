    "description": "This is a fantastic hike to the summit of Burke Mountain.  The lower area climbs in a wide road, but as you get higher, the trail can become quite steep and around the 800m mark, becomes a little overgrown.  At more than one point, you will have to climb the steep slope using your hands as well, though for the most part it is not too hard a climb.  No dramatic views on the way up, though decent at the top.  Even in August, the trail can be muddy at the top and there was still some snow.Lots of scenic waterfalls and plenty of water.  The middle third of the hike has accessible and clean looking water to refill your bottles.  I drank it without getting at all sick, but take your own precautions.  The trail is reasonably well marked, but I would still suggest using your GPS given how overgrown it is.  The coordinates attached are for the ascent and descent.  Bathe yourself in mosquito repellant cause I have never seen so many in the top third of the hike, given all the standing water up there.Also came across a black bear .. so be aware.",
    "directions": "Go up Coast Meridian and turn right on Harper.  Park just before the gun club",
