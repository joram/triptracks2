    "description": "Nice trail not very well maintained therefore difficult. Expect large washouts, fallen trees logs branches and other debris. I did it in reverse and not sure the first part of the trail (last if you were traveling the loop clockwise) would be passable. Very muddy and it has been dry for months this summer. Not a fast trail given the conditions but fun!",
    "directions": "Take Ottawa Ave. to Chemical Rd. First trailhead is 16.8 kilometers on the left from the start of Chemical Rd.",
