    "description": "NTS Map: 083H11Winding trail(s) through northern aspen forest.  Used for cross country in the winter and MTB in the no-snow seasons.  You can take a few different permutations of the trails to find a suitable length & difficulty.The trail has many hills, two that are challenging climbs for fit mtb'rs and skiers only. Within the city limits of Edmonton, it gives the rider or skier a sense of being out of the city. There are a few trails not plowed or used for skiing where snowshoes could be used, please don't walk on the XC trails though.Wildlife includes white tail deer, beaver, Canada geese, a myriad of waterfowl, white pelicans, pileated woodpecker, and even lynx.You can spend anywhere from 1/2 an hour to 2 or more investigating all of the trails in the area.  Many are lit (at least in winter) for night use.",
