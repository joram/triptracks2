    "description": "On a tributary of this brook, which doesn't even show up on topo maps, is a couple of falls with the topmost fall measuring about 30ft.   The walk starts on the edge of a blueberry field and that's the only easy part of the journey.  Once you enter the woods, you make your way to the brook and move upstream over deadfall and some small shrubbery.  after a little while you come up to  the tributary on your left and you follow it to a couple of falls.  Atr the top fall, I ended up climbing the steep slope to the side thinking I could bypass all the shrubbery close to the stream.  At first I assumed correctly but then I got into a logged area which was full of raspberry bush....but then it got worse where the terrain got steep it was chockfull of evergreen and old fall trees everywhere...I didn't enjoy this part at all so I think getting back to the stream is probably the way to go.  also maybe there are some more falls on the main stem of the brook further upstream than the tributary.",
