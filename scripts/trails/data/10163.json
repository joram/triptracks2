    "description": "This is a steep hike in the trees followed by a solid scramble up the ridge to the top. At the top it offers views of Three Sisters, Rundle, Goat Creek, Ha Ling, and Canmore.Initially in the first few minutes, the trail looks like it might go left or right, but it just goes straight ahead. Follow the trail, and you will end up on a riverbed. Follow the riverbed a little bit until you see a cairn on the left side, follow the path away from the riverbed and back in the trees. Eventually you work your way out of the trees, keep following the trial and you will soon see the summit. Follow the ridge upto the summit. There are two peaks at the top, pretty much equal height. We went to the left one to avoid climbing the one on the right (more difficult).While in the trees, it is steep hiking, as you get higher, it gets pretty steep with loose rock on slabs. I would recommend two trekking poles.Did this trek in July and it was still cold enough to snow at the summit. With the high wind it did also make it rather chilly. Come prepared.Stats: roughly 10 km return trip, roughly 1000m elevation gain.",
    "directions": "Drive into Canmore, towards the Nordic Center, then continue past the reservoir/dams until you reach the Goat Creek trailhead parking lot on the right side. This parking lot also serves the Ha Ling, Goat Creek, and EEOR trailheads. Cross the road and go up the ramp and follow the waterway for several km past the Ha Ling trailhead (pasing numerous boulders) until you see a kairn.",
