    "description": "High Rim Trail from Kalamalka Provincial Park to the Repeater Tower.  Almost all uphill on a good trail with a few fallen logs to cross.  14km one way.This GPS track log starts at the Red Gate in Kal Park, though the HRT actually begins at Cosens Bay parking lot.  This log shows the climb/descent via the \"Stone Free\" mountain bike trail, which is much more fun to run than the HRT proper trail.  From the top of Stone Free, this is a straightforward uphill hike with a minor bit of searching for the signs when you intersect logging roads.  The trail is not more than 20-30m away when you do hit the logging road...just look for the signs and flagging tape.  Great trail.  No real water access above Cosens Creek (just before the top of Twisted Sisters bike trail).",
    "directions": "Follow BC Parks signs to any of the parking areas at Kalamalka Lake Provincial Park.  HRT trailhead is at Cosens Bay gate.  Enter the gate from the parking lot and you can't miss the giant trailhead sign on your left (new this year).  Enjoy!",
