    "description": "Chisel Peak is a 5-10hr scramble. The last hour or 2 is easy-moderate scrambling.This is a \"difficult\" hike or easy scramble to the top of the Invermere/Windermere skyline. The views from the summit towards the columbia valley are breathtaking. The first half of the walk is on an OK trail mostly in the bush, but the last half involves a little class 4 scrambling or some. The summit traverse is not for the faint hearted and some exposure exists. Time between 4.5 hours (if I trail run this) or 10 hours for a leisurly walk with my kids.",
