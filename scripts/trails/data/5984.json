    "description": "This trail is within Well Gray Park and follows the Murtle River.  It passes under Pyramid Mtn and accesses a couple of side trips to little lakes or swamp meadows.  The trail ends at Horseshoe Falls but the most impressive set of falls is Majerus Falls.  The trail is moderately well maintained but is quite rough for mountain biking.  It can be done in one long day of hiking but is best as an over-nighter.\nThe GPS route submitted is only as far as Majerus Falls",
    "directions": "Follow the Clearwater Valley Road into Wells Gray Park.  The main road paved and is plowed to Helmcken Falls year round.  The trailhead starts at the Pyramid Campsite, approx 44km from the Yellowhead (Hwy 5) jct.  It is well marked and there are maps available at the visitor centre at the hwy jct during the summer tourist season (May-Oct).",
