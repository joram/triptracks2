    "description": "This trail follows the cycling path circling Bear Creek in Lakewood along \rthe Bear Creek Greenway to Platte river and north to Commons Park in \rLoDo Denver. \r\rThis is a very well maintained route, and remains clear of snow and debris \ralmost year round, with one notable exception around bear valley park \rwhere a particular shrub has deposited no less than three thorns into my \rtire.\r\rThe bear creek portion is the most scenic, and after leaving the verdant \rbowl directly around Bear Creek Lake, runs up Mt Carbon (though more a \rhill than a mountain), through Fox Hollow golf course, and follows the \rcreek to its confluence point with the Platte, maintaining a nice tree-\rshaded ambiance the whole time. \r\rUpon joining the Platte, it also comes into rather close proximity with a \rhighway, and becomes much noisier, though the platte River is quite \rscenic on its own as well, with numerous ducks and geese paddling \rplacidly throughout. Supposedly, the Platte is popular with inner-tubers \rduring the late spring melts as well.\r\rThe trail along the Platte actually extends south all the way to Chatfield \rReservoir, and north past downtown as well, however, Commons park is \ra great place to stop and relax before heading back to Bear Creek Lake.",
    "directions": "Take C470 towards Morrisson, and turn east on Morrisson Rd. Take the first \rLeft onto Kumpfmiller Dr where the Park entrance can be found. Day passes \rto the Park are 5$, or 4$ for seniors.\r\r",
