    "description": "It is well built and laid out trail, yet somewhat overgrown in the opening in lower elevations and very difficult to follow in the treeless alpine so it would be easier to find own route up at peak area.  There are numerous beautiful spots along the way from Beth lake, old growth forest stands, beautiful alpine meadows and rocky views, various lakes and tarns, and view of great mountains in all directions.",
    "directions": "From Vancouver; Get off the first and only sign for Furry creek from Sea-to-sky hwy.   You reach 3way stop sign with ?discover furry creek? sign in front; turn left.   Then another 3way stop sign for Furry creek golf club; go straight.   The road start going up steeply then soon you see the stop sign with turn off for Furry creek Dr; turn right here. Stop the odometer to 0 here.    Soon you go past this sign & gate. Gate doesn't seem to get locked up at all recently.   \nHere are some major forks before reaching ?trail head?. There is a three way fork at 1.5k at quarry; take far right. \nAt 1.9k a fork with yellow gate to right; go straight. \nAt 2.8k there is a sharp fork to right; go straight again(no photo).\nAt 3.7k there is a fork of left or right; take left which looks more overgrown. This road will start scratching your car in 500m or so, then reach another fork at 4.6k.  This fork at 4.6k should be the parking area ?trail head? for Capilano mountain.\nNow you might choose to park your car at 3.7k turn off area to avoid any possible scratching. It is only 900m to the trail head.",
