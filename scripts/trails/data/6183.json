    "description": "Many hilly sections with mostly fast and flowey trails. Can be ridden after rain due to the sandy base. A few stunts to challange the skills. No signs or trail markers. Overall a very fun trail to ride.",
    "directions": "From Mansfield ski resort, drive approx. 3 km to gravel road (right turn only), follow this for 200 meters to parking lot and trail head.
