    "description": "You start along the Napali coast and then go inland along a small river to find a gorgeous really tall waterfall.\nHike in along the trail by the coast and visit the beach for a while. You can not hike further along the coast without a permit. But you CAN follow the river inland. For a day hike , not too strenuous, this is an ideal trip.",
    "directions": "Take Hawaii State Hwy 560 up to the North part of Kauai and go west as far as possible, to Haena State Park. Park and follow your nose.",
