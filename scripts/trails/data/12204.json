    "description": "Grand Canyon South Kaibab to Skeleton Point section is the longest hike recommended for day hikers.  The out and back route has a vertical of 610 meters (starting at almost 2200m); the hot, exposed trail adds to the difficulty.We got a fairly early start so it was quite cool; but that quickly changed when the sun hit the trail -- 10\u00b0 C (50\u00b0F) became 35\u00b0C (95\u00b0F) in about ninety minutes.  This was early October.There's a sign along the way that states \"Going down is optional -- going up is mandatory\"; a point that can't be stressed enough.  We started with 3 liters of water each and returned empty.",
    "directions": "Off of Yaki Point Road 36\u00b003'10.6\"N 112\u00b005'02.2\"W -- during peak seasons you'll have to take a shuttle bus.",
