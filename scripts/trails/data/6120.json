    "description": "This trail starts off easy with a steady incline on an old abandon road then follows Jubilee Creek to the summit of Mount Murray (1,993 Meters) the last 1.5 kms becomes quite steep and can be challenging. The trail takes you to the alpine where you can eat your lunch near a lake on top of the Montain. There is even a picnic table near the lake to eat your lunch at. A short hike south across the valley will take you to Greenberry Creek and the top of the Yellowhawk Trail.",
