    "description": "Start at Gibson Lake and following the trail towards Kokanee Lake. After about half an hour turn right up the mountain and follow the trail up. The trail is pretty obvious. The last part of the trail is steep with a lot of small rocks which makes it a difficult scrample. Trail length is 6.4 km one way, so 12.8 in total.",
    "directions": "From Nelson, drive over the Orange Bridge towards Balfour/Kaslo. After you have passed 6 mile, turn left of Kokanee Glacier road. Follow the forest road up for 16 km. The road can be pretty rough, vehicle with clearance is recommended.",
