    "description": "An old road leads to the sub-alpine and treeline. There is a local snowmobile club cabin for shelter at 6500ft in the meadows. A long but easy walk leads to the 7800ft summit. Good views of the Rockies, Cariboos and McBride. Do not use this area in  winter for skiing, it is an endorsed snowmobile haven in winter.\r\nCurrent conditions:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r",
    "directions": "From McBride Main St turn south (left) onto 1st Avenue. Follow 1St Ave and turn right after 300 meters crossing CNR track.
