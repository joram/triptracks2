    "description": "This is a mostly easy hike to a few waterfalls on two unnamed brook off the Old union Rd in Greenfied.  There are no trails to the falls and the fall height vary between 5-18ft.   From where you parked your car, walk upstream for 100m to a nice 12ft waterfall.  Then return to your car and follow the stream downstream.  Within about 300m you will encounter two main falls and countless smaller falls.  The largest fall (18ft) unfortunately has some deadfall covering it up.  The last main fall (about 15ft) is actually quite scenic and has no deadfall (November 2018).  Continue downstream all the way to the railroad track and then follow railroad heading east.  There are some large outcrops of sandstone on the way to the next stream that are really neat to look at?some have good overhangs.  Walk about 1.5km on the track and then follow a small stream that appears on your right.  This stream has two main falls of about 10 and 15ft.   The last fall is very close to some ATV trails so that might make the hike shorter to use those.",
    "directions": "Take Old Greenfield Rd and turn on Old Union Rd.  Drive 1.5km on Old Union Rd for and park where the stream crosses the road at 45.380983\u00b0, -63.166332\u00b0",
