    "description": "Right beside the \"too\" popular Ha Ling Peak, this is an easy hike, no technical difficulties and nothing impressive but an interesting view of Ha Ling, Rundle, Lawrence Grassi, etc. from another viewpoint. Same trail as Ha Ling all the way to the col. Then, just walk the col to the miners. You can do 4 peaks total. The first one on your left has some exposure if you go all the way, but it's a very little walk there and again, no technical challenge.Elevation about 763 m, 860 total. Max elevation about 2425 m.3-4 hours hike.",
    "directions": "From Canmore, take Smith-Dorrien Trail to the Goat Creek day use parking, soon after Grassi Lakes. Then Ha Ling trailhead is right across the road.",
