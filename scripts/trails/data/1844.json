    "description": "NTS Map: 082O04Elevation Gain: 455 m (1,495 ft).This steep trail takes you part way up Cascade Mountain just outside the town of Banff and ends in a large bowl that has been gouged out of a mountainside by a glacier. Jumbles of rock beside an alpine pond in this cirque make for a good lunch spot. Along the trail you pass the fenced off ventilation shafts from the C-Level coal beds that were part of the Bankhead mining operation until the early 1920's. The return distance is 7.8 km with an elevation gain of 450 m.",
    "directions": "The trail starts at Upper Bankhead, off Minnewanka Road about 7km north of the town of Banff.",
