    "description": "Total Distance: 36.0 km (return) \nEstimated Time: 11 - 12 hours \nElevation Gain:  614-650m\nLake elevation 764m \nStart Elevation: 150m \nIt is possible to bike the first 5.5-6.5km but the last 6.0-6.5km might not be worth it. As gulleys and dead fall cause you to carry your bike over and under things in order to continue.\n10km requires you to ford the gold creek a number of times. Once to sand bar in the middle the back to the east bank again. To regain the trail on the east side. Then 11km you cross onto a sand bar and then ford to the west side and pick up the trail again.\n After that the trail deteriorates somewhat due to some deadfall and goes through nice old-growth forest. Trail is well marked in most of the sections and isn't extremely difficult to follow. \nAt the last 1-1.5km to HF Lake you pass a major slide and pick the ribbons up in a creek. You follow the creek north but you need to pay special attention to the west side. As ribbons start again up on the bank where you might not notice them. If you stay in the creek you will come upon a suspended bolder between two cliffs and a water fall.  At this point you need to turn around and find the ribbons on the west bank. Where they pick up again and lead you NW and to HF lake. \nAs for the lake shore its soft and a marsh so tent spots are interesting to find. Like other trails in Golden Ears I would suggest a dry day before taking this trip. As the brush is thick and you will get completely soaked by the 6.5km mark.",
