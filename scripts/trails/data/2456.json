    "description": "A nice, average, *easy* urban path a.k.a. a GreenWay.  Great for kids, families, dogs with hip ailments, etc.  An accessable ride or walk when you're visiting from out-of-town and tired of watching TV in the hotel room.\r\nWatch for trail flooding during heavy runoff times.",
    "directions": "There are several places to pick up the trail, Lakeshore & Truswell will get you to one end, Springfield and Ziprick is the other end.",
