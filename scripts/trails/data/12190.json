    "description": "This is a short hike either on an old woods roads or on the Bay of Fundy seashore if you time the tides correctly to a beautiful waterfall that comes out of a small ravine and falls into the ocean.  the path goes through an ugly patch of abandoned RV's before you make your way through the thin forest.  then it's a matter of carefully going down the slope to the fll.  there is a smaller fall just upstream of the main one as well.",
    "directions": "Make your way to Morden on the North Mountain.  follow the seashore going west.  The paved road becomes a dirt road (French Cross Rd) and finally descends to the ocean.  A stream comes out into the ocean.  Park there and walk to the west to the next stream to see the fall",
