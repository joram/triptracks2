    "description": "The trail is used by ATVs and snowmobiles so it is fairly wide and well groomed.  When the snow is not on the ground there are several sections that include loose rocks and  small drops.  In the winter the trail is evened out, although the ATVs can leave ruts.\r\r",
    "directions": "The trail head is reached via a dirt road from the town of Westfield.  From Saint John, take highway 7 towards Fredericton until you come to the exit to Westfield (2nd exit after the 2 lane highway).  At the intersection of highway 102 and 177, turn left onto 177.  Travel for 3 km and take a dirt road on the left.  It looks like a driveway, however it will continue up past a couple of cottages and derelict vehicles.  This road will take you back under highway 7.  Just after going under the highway you will reach a gate.  If the gate is locked it will add 2 km to the trail.  If the gate is unlocked, drive on until you reach Robinhood Lake.  Park off the road near the lake.  The trail starts at the intersection of Robinhood and Little John lakes.",
