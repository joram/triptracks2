    "description": "NTS Map:92F1.  TC Trail from Departure Bay ferry terminal to TC Highway south of Nanaimo. Although designated as an all purpose trail, those attempting this section on a touring bike will do a lot of walking. The trail includes the famous Abyss mountain bike area with it's large fault. Passes through Extension, a small town with a long history of coal.",
    "directions": "From the Departure Bay ferry terminal proceed straight ahead and watch for TC Trail markers. Best to wait till ferry traffic has departed. When approaching from the south, take the first right after crossing the Nanaimo River bridge onto White Rapids Road.",
