    "description": "As I was driving back from the Wentworth Valley towards Truro, I could see a large loss of elevation and I began to think that maybe I had missed a few waterfalls along this river. The Folly River has two well known falls; the Toblerone and the lower Folly river fall but I thought that there should be more. During the winter of 2018, I spotted a small area in the upper reaches of the Folly River which had 4 white spots on sat imagery that were close to each other. The 1:50 000 topo were no help has there wasn't even a change of colour line in that area.There is a well maintained dirt road leading to about 500m of this spot. I also made some inquiries with some white water paddlers and they confirmed my hunch! Finally spring arrived and I decided to check these out. A short walk along a secondary brook leads to the Folly River from the dirt road. There is even a scenic 20ft fall on the tributary! Immediately downstream a gorge began and I wasn't disappointed. there are lots of falls, rapids and rock walls in a section measuring about 100m. Some of the landscape down even look like Nova Scotia! There is one larger, single drop fall in the middle but I couldn't get to the front of it has the water levels were quite high! You can't miss it as it has a large square boulder right downstream of it giving the name of the fall; Grandfather clock!",
    "directions": "Highway 4 towards Wentworth, turn right on Stevens Rd and again turn right after the bridge over Folly River. You will drive by a stone quarry and then spot a well maintained dirt road leading up a hill on the left. Park there but continue on dirt road in a straight manner and find a culvert going under this dirt road. Follow the tributary downstream. Main falls are at; N45\u00b0 30.970' W63\u00b0 32.135'.",
