    "description": "This is not a defined trail but it is a neat area to explore.  I spotted some scree on the sat imagery and decided to check it out.  the walk in the forest was easy and got to the top of the scree slope pretty quickly.   the slope is quite steep and unfortunately there are only small cliffs at the top...nothing really impressive for climbing.I ended up at the bottom of the scree slope and heard some falls on the opposite side of the valley.  I walked a few min and found the mini cascades...nothing spectacular there.  I hiked up the main branch of Slokum Brook upstream and the whole brook was dry for a while and then there was water!   So the stream actually flows underground for part of its journey!Not far upstream of this, was one of the largest fall you will find on the south facing side of the North mountain.  there wasn't much flow that day but it would be impressive if there was.  There is also some rock walls on either side and I had to boulder my way up the fall itself (but I was lucky in a way because it was dry!)",
