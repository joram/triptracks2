    "description": "Town of Canmore Map, the red trail goes beside the Bow much of the distance, and includes 3 sisters path way. Much of it is paved but not all.My original plan for the day was Harvie Heights and ride the Banff Legacy trail however as it was closed due to a bear in the area I had to find a plan B, this trail was part of my plan B. Hence GPS data is for part of trail. I didn't have a map to follow.",
    "directions": "See Town map, one could start a number of locations. official map suggests cougar creek parking lot on Benchlands trail",
