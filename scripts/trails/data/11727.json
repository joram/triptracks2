    "description": "A half challenging, half casual, and throughout scenic hike!To get to the North Granite Ridge Trail, you first walk the Gibraltar Rock trail (1.3k) that then joins with the North Granite Ridge Trail (9.4k, around 4 hours). Rather than going straight ahead onto the South Granite Ridge trail you turn to the right at the end of the 9.4k to get to the Musquodoboit Rail Trail. There's a sheltered picnic spot. You then have another 7-ish k (took us 1.5 hours) back to the parking lot on the rail trail.",
    "directions": "From Halifax, take NS-107 E to Musquodoboit Harbour. Turn left onto NS-357 N (signs for Meagher's Grant/Middle Musquodoboit). Continue for another 15k to get to a small car park.",
