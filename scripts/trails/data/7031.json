    "description": "A short connector into the East Coast Trail that is suitable as either a starting point for longer treks of the ECT or a nice In-n-Out for a sample of the ECT. This takes you to perfectly groomed trails and amazing lookouts where you will often see Whales frollicking off the coast. \r\rIt has a few interesting features along it and you *MAY* wish to walk out along Torbay Point.  This is a potentially difficult, even dangerous walk where you can get quite close to the end of the point and the water.\r\rLocals fish from this area and it provides a great plac to sit and gaze.  It is very common to see whales off to either side of the point.\r\rThis trail was brought to my attention by Elke @ Points East Guest Haus just up (North) the road a bit. A great place to stay and a *very* knowledgeable lady on the ECT and Newfoundland Culture in general. \r\r",
    "directions": "Go to the end of Doran's Lane from Outer Cove, just South of Torbay on Hiway #30.  Well marked trailhead is there.",
