    "description": "This hike starts from the parking lot of the Burnaby Mountain Golf Club and is a loop that ends there. There is a nice selection of beer on the outdoor patio of the golf club for the post-hike activity.\rIt covers such areas as the Burnaby Mountain Conservation Area, and the North Road Trails.\r\rhttp://www.burnaby.ca/__shared/assets/Parks_and_Trails_-_Burnaby_Mountain_Conservation_Area_Map3258.pdf\r\rIt's a myriad of trails, great lunch spot overlooking the inlet at the same spot as Horizons restaurant, and you get about 250 metres of elevation gain. High ranking and can be done at various times of the year.\rOne note, the north part of the GPS has a straight line because of the canopy and the inability to get a good GPS reading. Don't worry, it's the TransCanada trail and it is well marked and wide. \r",
