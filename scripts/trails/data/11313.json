    "description": "There are two segment of the eco trail located in Halls Harbour.  As you get to the harbour one is located off Cove Rd.  This segment is short at about 400m one way and it leads from the forest into an open field and towards highway 359.The other segment begins at the wharf and quickly ascends the slope by the stream.  This segment has some elevation gain and lots of bench to rest.  It's a loop so you will come back to the start after about 600m.  The forest has some aid damage but none of it is on the trail as it is well maintained.  there is some wire rope in the ascents.",
    "directions": "Highway 359 to Halls Harbour.  The two trails are indicated by signs once you reach the village.",
