    "description": "Several kilometres of interwinding multi-use trails for easy hiking, trail running and biking which feature some technical sections and jumps for bikers. The small park is frequented by dog walkers with plenty of parking. There is a large trail map at the car park showing detailing trails. The trails are mostly flat with a few small hills and suitable all year round as the area doesn't get much snowfall.There is plenty of nice vegetation and wildlife to look at with some areas marked as dedicated conservation areas. The trails are well maintained and have recently had some wooden bridges constructed.The park is next to the Lazo Marsh conservation area which is also worth checking out. It is easy to find your way there once you look at the maps.PDF download of details and map of park: http://cvmtb.com/maps/newoods.pdf",
