    "description": "I hiked to Noonmark Mtn via Stimson Trail for hike out.  And I took longer trail (Felix Adler & Old Dix Trails) for hike in.  Starting from the Ausable Parking lot, total hiking distance is 6.0 miles.\rThe Stimson Trailhead is located about 0.4 miles away from the Ausable Parking lot.  From the trailhead, the first 0.6 miles are easy hike and you reach to the junction to Old Dix Trail. Take right tral onto Stimson Trail. Next 1.1 miles are getting challenge.  Around the close to the summit, the trails are rocky and very steneous.\rNoonmark Mtn is elevation 3556 ft.\rOn the return, I took Noonmark from the SE, via Felix Adler Trail for 1.0 mile, then, reached to the junction to Old Dix Trail, and went on this trail for 1.7 miles.  I came back to the first trail junction which is to Stimson Trail. I went on 0.6 miles on this trail and went on another 0.4 mile to return to the parking lot.\r\rNoonmark is not Adirondack 46 high peaks, but, the summit shows 360 degree views.  You can see 13-14 mountain's peaks from there.\rAlso, On Stimson Trail, there are 3-4 locations which you can see nice view on the way to the summit.",
    "directions": "Off exit-30 on Interstate-87, take Rt9 and Route 73 toward to St. Huberts.   The parking lot is located on Ausable Rd where Ausable Golf Course is located.  This is off road from Route 73.",
