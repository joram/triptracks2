    "description": "This is a short hike to a beautiful waterfall near Baxter's Harbour.  The trail is mostly on a dirt road until you veer off the path and into the woods.  Soon you come up to the rim of a good size depression (considering the size of the brook).   The fall is a perched type with a height of probably 40feet.  There is some evidence of people having campfires at the base and at the top.",
    "directions": "Go to Baxter's Harbour and follow the old Baxter Mill Rd going east.  The dirt road is at 45.231642, -64.497848",
