    "description": "This trail starts with a very slight incline for a good 20 minutes. So slight, you hardly notice it until you find yourself getting more and more level with the snow-dusted Golden Ears to your left. Many little creeks cross the trail and allow for dillydallying or rock-hopping. At about 2km, you'll find a gate crossing the path. Go around, and shortly there will be a sign to the left for the Lower Falls trail. Take this cutoff and after an amazing backcountry trail that is very steep downward (but manageable for anyone with good shoes) jaunt to the Lower Falls. The views here are outstanding. Better view of the Falls than at the end of the conventional Lower Falls trail. Now, you can either go back up the steep part and reconnect to the old trail to return, or go back to the parking lot via the Lower Falls trail (reviewed elsewhere on this site).\r\n\r\nOn a sunny Saturday, we encountered 3 people on this trail (the Lower Falls bit is more popular).",
    "directions": "From Vancouver, Lougheed Hwy to the SECOND Dewdney Trunk (yes, there are 2). Turn LEFT at Dewdney Trunk, then LEFT on 232. Follow signage to Golden Ears. Park at GOLD CREEK DAY AREA. From the parking lot, follow gravel past lot to gates (as though you were going past the parking lot. There is a \"dead end\". Trailhead is unmarked. It will veer to the right, and then left.",
