    "description": "Elevation gain: 3500ft\nThis is an excellent ski trip above Taylor Lake to some nice slopes that are often very good for great turns. Start by skiing to Taylor Lake, a simple ski route, to the campground area, a nice stop for lunch. \nNow head north from the rear of the campground, at the sign for Panorama ridge trail. Follow this trail 0.5 km uphill to open meadows, full of flowers in summer and nice larches in fall. Follow the meadows about 1km along larches to the base of the ridge to the right. Now find your way up the ridge along steeper slopes until you come to a spot overlooking the valley with Castle mountain across. \n Now continue along the ridge towards the treeline if the snow conditions are good. Sometimes this ridge gets very windy and the snow turns to hard slabs which can be dangerous. The ridge continues to a summit at about 8000ft with views to the Lake Louise ski area in the distance. Ski down carefully into the treed slopes, some of the steep west facing open sections can be crusty or slabby and can slide. Better skiing is found among the large trees in the more shaded sections. Skiers and hikers can also explore small lakes under the cliffs below, above the meadows, with many colorful larches in the area.\n In winter please check the Avaluator  (Online Trip Planner) rating is:    Challenging.    \nCurrent conditions:\nEditor's Note: Attached GPS data is for Taylor and O'Brien Lakes but not up to Panorama ridge.",
