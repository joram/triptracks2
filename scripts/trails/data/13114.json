    "description": "You have to park your car right by a small restaurant and the trailhead can be found right behind it. Once you've reached the trail, continue your way through the woods which offer magnificent scenery for a relaxing hike. Around half way to the summit, the grade gets harder but the tread is not technical at all. The forest fades away as you gain altitude and you start to get amazing views of the city bellow. Once you get to the top, on a clear day you can see three of the four highest mountains in Mexico (Popocatepetl, Iztaccihuatl, and Nevado de Toluca). You can come back the same way or keep going and go down to the Albergue Alpino.",
    "directions": "To get to Ajusco from Mexico City you must take the Pereferico towards Toluca. From Pereferico turn towards Carretera Picahco Ajusco. On the way you will pass six flags, and the highway will be reduced to one lane. From here you have 2 choices when the road comes to a intersection. To geto to Abrevadero follow the road to the right. You can park in the restaurant called \"El Abrevadero\" and start hiking from there. The route is well marked and steepens as you clear the tree line and make your way up the rocky slopes. Like many of the Mexican volcanoes Ajusco is heavily weathered and there is a lot of loose rock dotting her slopes.",
