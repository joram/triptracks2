    "description": "NTS Map: 082J14Elevation Gain: 311 m (1,020 ft). Note - time and distance are return.The trail to Ribbon Falls is an easy, enjoyable hike, passing through a deep canyon with several waterfalls. It is a very popular trail because of the gentle grade. It's suitable for families with small children and weekends are very busy. It is also the first leg of the trail to  Ribbon Lake,   Guinn's Pass and   Buller Pass.Bikes are allowed on the first 3.5km but there are always some who bike all the way to the falls.The falls are very busy, but worth enduring the crowds. Along the way you will find numerous waterfalls (especially early in the season) and an abandoned logging camp.",
    "directions": "Ribbon Creek parking area in Kananaskis Country, just off the road to Kananaskis Village.",
