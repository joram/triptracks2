    "description": "An adventure.  Drove in 4WD totrail head but there is an option to walk in by the river bed but add an extra hour each way for this.  Beware some rock fall hazard where trail is not clear in the scree on a short section.  made it to mountain plateau and could clearly see the lookout hut and path but was forced to turn back in a hurry because of lightning storm.  Great views of Mountains, Ghost Valley and Devils head.",
    "directions": "hwy 1A from Calgary through Cochrane.  Turn right onto hwy 40 after Cochrane proceed through to Richards Road but head west on road 270 past public land use signage. Follow for 18Km west until road heads down to river valley Signage \"Only 4WD beyond this point\".There is a parking area here to walk in to trail head if your not in a 4WD but add an extra hour each way.  4WD head down the road to the river bead and follow road tracks to Trail head which is not well marked, use your gps.  There is a very rough defined path up to trail head at edge of forest from there the path was well defined.",
