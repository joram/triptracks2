    "description": "This is actually Golf Course Cart Path.  In winter time, golf course is closed and anyone can enjoy snowshoing or cross country ski.  Once golf course is opened in May, we're not allowed to enter the cart path for any other reasons other than playing golf.  Golf course generally closes around November.",
