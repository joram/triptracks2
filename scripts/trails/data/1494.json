    "description": "Easy summer scramble, easy ski mountaineering ascent.  Details in \"Scrambles in the Canadian Rockies\" (summer route) and \"Summits and Icefields of the Canadian Rockies\" (winter).  Straight up Helen Creek, then up the SE ridge of Cirque.  Watch out for the cornice.  Skiing down the ridge is a little dicy (narrow & corniced on one side, no snow on the other).  Summer trail looks pretty easy.Distance is 14km return.In winter please check the local avalanche bulletins.NTS Map: 082N09Elevation Gain: 1,050 m (3,444 ft).",
    "directions": "33 km north of Lake Louise junction on Icefields Parkway.  Park beside road - should be obvious trail on north side of creek.",
