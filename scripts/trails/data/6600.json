    "description": "This is a short hike to get to a waterfall on a tributary of the Weir River.  If you look at my GPS track, I had no idea where this fall was and hence the long way to get there. This fall would be about 50 feet in total height but it is separated into two parts.\r\rMost of the walk along the Wier Bk is quite nice.  The trees are massive evergreen and even the height of the summer, it is nice and cool place to walk.  The brook itself is only about 4-5 feet wide in most areas so it is easy to jump across from side to side to make walking easier. Only in the area around the fall will you find deciduous forests.  There are some paths along the left bank of the tributary where the fall is located although I am not sure where they end up as I followed the stream instead.  The fall is quite nice especially the upper part and it makes for a quick hike when you are on your way to or back from the valley.\r",
    "directions": "This is the direction to get to the falls in the fastest way possible.  In Newport Corner turn on  Collier Rd W and continue down the hill to a bridge over Wier Bk.  Park and head downstream until there is a tributary on your left.  Head upstream on this tributary to the fall.",
