    "description": "Mount Lipsett is located next to highway #40 in the Elbow-Sheep Wildlands south of  Kananaskis Lakes. This hike is considered moderate to difficult with an elevation gain of 714 Meters. Approximate return distance is 12.5km. Allow 5 to 6 hours return trip. The 4 boulders at the tree edge mark the old mining road that leads to the top of Mount Lipsett. Head up the trail a short distance then turn left where the trail forks right, and stay on the old road that goes from a single track to double track. Near the start you can expect several muddy sections that last all season. Once you gain elevation your boots will lighten up as the mud falls off. After about an hour or so, beautiful views of the valley below will keep you company as you continue up the old road. An abundance of wildflowers paint the meadows located below the ridge and are in full bloom from late June to Late August. Once you arrive at the ridge proper, stay right avoiding a dead end road that spurs off towards another short west ridge. Work your way up to the summit cairn while enjoying the views on both sides of the ridge as you climb higher. Mist Mountain towers above to the east and makes you feel lower then you actually are. Views from the summit are absolutely stunning and well worth the effort.",
