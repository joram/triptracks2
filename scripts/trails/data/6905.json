    "description": "This is a short walk to a beautiful waterfall located by the Trans Canada highway.  A lot of people pass by this fall everyday but there is probably only a handful of people that have seen this fall.  Total trip distance is less than 500m\r\rFrom the highway, walk back to the guardrail and down the scree slope towards the forest.  Enter the forest and walk towards the magnificent maple tree which has a huge tree trunk.  Once at the maple tree, you should hear the falls located down the ravine in front of you.  Just before you get to the river, you will cross what looks to be an old road that parallels the stream.  Maybe this used to be an old road that took you up the Cobequid range.  There is another screen slope to navigate down to the base of the falls.  Be careful on this one as the material here is quite loose.  There is a large pool at the base of the 20foot fall.  I am not sure if it is deep enough to swim. Hiking to this fall is a good way to split a long roadtrip.\r\r",
    "directions": "Travelling on the TCH towards Halifax, you park at the end of the guard rail located 3km after the toll.  You should be able to seethe Mines Bass River Rd overpass from where you park your car (45\u00b0 28.609'N, 63\u00b0 39.295'W)\r",
