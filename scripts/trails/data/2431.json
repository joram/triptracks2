    "description": "This is a set of loops and other trails in the Salmon River Wilderness area.  It uses part of the old Salmon River trail but leaves from a new trailhead on Myra Road in Porters Lake.\r\n\r\nA complete trail description can be found at http://www.trails.gov.ns.ca/SharedUse/hx122b.html\r\n\r\nThe prettier parts of the trail are farther in at Granite and West Lakes and along the Salmon River.  The trail goes up and over several granite ridges and then down to the lakes and the river.  \r\n\r\nWalking the whole system will be about 20km but there are some unofficial campsites near Granite Lake.",
    "directions": "From highway 7 in Porters Lake follow Myra road for 8km.  The trailhead is in a small gravel parking lot on your left.  The trails aren't officially open yet so there is no sign.  There is only a railing made of logs going up the hill to indicate that you are in the right place.",
