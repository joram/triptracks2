    "description": "A very busy and highly utilized lake that maintains its rustic charms by not allowing big motors.  Lots of sail boats, canoes and fishermen.  A nice big ramp at the Southern end with plenty of parking.  The lake is roughly round and has a town beach and many houses on the Eastern shore.  The Southern shore and the bottom half of the Western shore is also well populated but the upper half of the Western shore and the Northern dam area are wooded and rustic.  This is also the site of two NECKRA races in the early fall.  The lake is a favorite workout spot for racers that like to do laps and stay in shape during the racing season.  I have fished, raced and exercised more on this lake than any other and consider it my \"home\" lake.  Drop me an e-mail and we'll do a few laps together.",
    "directions": "The ramp is on Rt. 44 in Bolton.  About a mile East of Bolton Notch or if you are coming from the East, its about 2 miles past the Rt. 31 intersection.  The ramp is easy to blow past so keep an eye out for the big church on the South side of Rt. 44 as it is almost directly opposite the ramp.",
