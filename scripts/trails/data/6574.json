    "description": "This is a good location to stretch your legs when you are on the highway over the Cobequid Pass.  Leave your car by the side of the road where the brook flows into culvert and follow the stream down to two waterfalls.\nThe walking is very easy since the forest is mostly mature  maple, beech and oak trees, while the area around the falls are composed of mature evergreen.  Facing downstream and on the left bank, I came across an old shack (very Blair Witch looking).  The falls are quite tall and could possible be used for ice climbing depending on how much ice forms over the course of the season.  The good thing is that it's not very far off the road so if the conditions aren't right you haven't wasted too much time.",
    "directions": "Coming from Amherst, the stream flows underneath the highway approximately 1.8km from the Winchester overpass.",
