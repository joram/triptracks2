    "description": "This is a hike at the top of Mount Lemmon near Tucson.  It is an easy little loop.  There are other trails at the top but we only did the little one.  Nothing spectacular but if you make the trip to the top it provides some nice views of Tucson below.  Going to the end of the road leads you to the gate for the Stewart Observatory areas (a collection of large telescopes under the big white domes).  The altitude is over 9,000 feet and the temperature is 20-30 farenheit lower than on the valley floor in Tucson.  The signs of a large fire in 2002 are everywhere.  The date we were there we stopped at the National Park/Forest Service information centre and the attendant had just seen a mountain lion (i.e. cougar) a few feet from the information centre and the highway (on a bright day in mid morning).  It is only about 3 km in total but we took a detour part way down one of the other off shoot trails and then doubled back.For guided hiking and biking trips in Arizona, check out aoa-adventures.com.",
    "directions": "See GPS.  At the top of the Mount Lemmon Highway just before you get to the ski lift turn right and go to the end of the road - there are 2 small parking lots.",
