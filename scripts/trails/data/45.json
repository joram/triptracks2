    "description": "NTS Map: 092G07Another of Peggy Moire's all season river walk and bird sancturary (and probably Blackberry) park walks.  Peggy is an old-time member of the North Shore Hikers from the 50's that lists Minnekhada as one of her favourites, as a moderate place to hike with lots of distractions and birdlife. She describes it as \"beautiful\" with a few inclines, and lots to see.  The area is very diverse, as the map shows.",
