    "description": "One of the Whiteshell Provincial Park's first interpretive trails. It leads  through a small, drainage system that is typical of the park and the vast  Precambrian Shield.\nYou may choose to hike the short loop of 2.8 km, or the longer 4.6-km trail which reaches McGillivray Lake. Hikers on this trail for the first time, should be aware that there are several, fairly steep inclines along the way and that rock surfaces are slippery when wet. Depending on the season, recent rainfall and beaver activity, you may encounter wet conditions that require short detours. Always return to the main, marked trail as it is easy to get disoriented on rock outcrops. Proper footwear will make your hike more enjoyable.",
    "directions": "Right off of highway 44 between Rennie and Caddy Lake.",
