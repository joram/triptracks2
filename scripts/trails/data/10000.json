    "description": "There are a number of trails in Torrey Pines State park.\nThe geology of the area is interesting from the beach you can see significant evidence of faults in the cliffs.\nhttp://www.torreypine.org/activities/hiking-trails.html\nYou can walk to the beach and get down on the beach. Beware heading south on the beach from Flat Rock you will be headed towards Blacks Beach which \nthe locals consider a clothing option beach. (The sign says \"nudity prohibited\" but it's ignored.\nThe sign says beware of rattle snakes. We did see a snake but it wasn't a rattle snake just a gopher snake (constrictor not poisonous)",
    "directions": "Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve is located between La Jolla and Del Mar, California, north of San Diego.\nTake Hwy 5 to Carmel Valley Road, go West to Camino Del Mar (coast hwy). Go South (left) about a mile to the reserve entrance (right) at the foot of the hill. There is a fee for entry into the park in March 2011 it was $10 for the day.",
