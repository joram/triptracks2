    "description": "This is a hike to a very unknown waterfall near Digby.  You set off through alders but fear not a semi established path lies ahead.  Follow the path to the mature evergreen forest and at this point you should hear the falls straight ahead.  If you crossed the brook back at the road you might be surprised to see how such a small brook can create a beautiful fall.  Once in the evergreen the terrain slopes downward until you come out to a knife's edge.  The fall are to you right.  From this point the terrain becomes pretty vertical to get to the base of the fall so be careful as the moss covered grown can be very slippery.",
    "directions": "Highway 101.  Take exit 25 and then the Back Rd and turn right on Lansdowne Rd.  The brook crosses the road at approx 44.582682, -65.726831 and the fall is downstream of the bridge or culvert.",
