    "description": "Very easy trail and perfect for snowshoeing or  walk. Easy (30m total elevation) route from the Burstall Pass parking lot out to the furthest lake and back along the eastern shorelines of 2 lakes. Superb pine forest paths and typically lots of snow, with excellent views of many of the mountains around the valley - Chester, Birdwood, Commonwealth, Smuts, Murray, Galatea, etc. Washroom at the parking lot.",
    "directions": "Either drive south from Canmore on Three Sisters Parkway which turns into Smith-Dorrien (aka Spray Lakes) Trail. Parking lot is apx 42 km down. Alternately, take Hwy 40 (Kananaskis Trail) south from Hwy 1 and after about 50 km turn into Peter Lougheed Prov Park. Drive another few km and turn right onto Smith-Dorrien Trail. Continue about 20 km up the road to the parking lot. Note that Smith-Dorrien Trail is gravel, but wide and well maintained. Drive carefully in winter as it can be slippery. Or, Kilometer 23 in \"Smith Dorrien Trail\" from the \"Kananaskis Trail\" on the west side of the road.",
