    "description": "This is a popular, well maintained, well marked trail that is super easy to access.  It starts with a long uphill followed by a not to technical, slaloming downhill.  You can access this trail from a few different locations.  The GPS attached is to access it from the east side of Peaks of Grassi.\nNEW:  Just added (into the same file) is more GPS data for starting at the Canmore Nordic Center, riding up the road to Grassi Lakes Trail.  A long pedal up and past Grassi Lakes, a push under the big silver Penstock (pipe), some more pushing (at least for us mortals), down Riders of Rohan and feeding into Highline from the West.",
    "directions": "A convenient round trip is to start at the Quarry Lake off-leash dog park, ride through the offleash park and follow the powerline trail over to Peaks of Grassi.   Go through the trail head on the east side of peaks at the small bay and you will see the Blue Highline sign just up the hill.  You can also see where the highline has continued in from 3 Sisters.",
