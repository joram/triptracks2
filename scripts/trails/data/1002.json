    "description": "Starts on the old Cabot Trail road bed and heads out to a point quite high above the Atlantic Ocean, the first part of the trail is well marked and groomed. The trail can go around in a circle, the back part being just a narrow track. This trail goes through a prime moose area and whales can be seen from the high areas overlooking the ocean. * Note: no dogs are allowed on this trail.\r\n\r\nThis trail is one of the \"must do\" hikes of the Cape Breton Highlands, with a winding trail that delivers view after view, and, a distance that will make even the ardent hiker hungry for some seafood chowder after a full day's hike.",
    "directions": "After crossing the Canso Causway look for signs leading to The Cabot Trail or take route 19 to Margaree Centre, turn left on the Cabot Trail go to the top of French Mountain and follow signs from there.  It's in the national park, and there is an information centre where one can find hiking and sea kayaking bools for the area, natural history, and a friendly parks staff.",
