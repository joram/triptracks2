    "description": "Located in South Nanaimo off the 5th Street Parkway Exit (Exit #16) and near Vancouver Island University, Morrell Sanctuary is 111 hectares of preserved second growth forest with 11 kilometers of walking trails. The public is free to enjoy the Sanctuary year round from dawn to dusk. \rwebsite: http://morrell.bc.ca/\rWith conservation in mind, William Morrell, a local contractor, donated this land in 1973 for the public's enjoyment. Last logged in the twenties, the Sanctuary is owned by the Nature Trust of British Columbia and managed by Morrell Sanctuary Society for Environmental Education (aka Morrell Nature Sanctuary). This non-profit organization consists of dedicated volunteers who care for the site, maintain trails, organize a variety of exciting programs and raise funds for the park's upkeep. They are supported by a large and diverse membership.\r",
