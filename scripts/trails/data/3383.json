    "description": "This is a really nice trail to walk/bike/snowshow/cross country ski and it doesn't take very long to complete... about 1.5 hours to do an entire loop around the lake. At certain points you can leave the main trail and go up to some land that belongs to the Fish and Game Club and there are cabins and fire pits as well. Very pretty views when the sun is shining. Rewarding and accessible for people of all ages and abilities. Good hike for dogs to come along.",
    "directions": "Drive up the old Lac Le Jeune highway towards Lac Le Jeune / Stake Lake area... Drive about half an hour up that road and eventually on the left hand side of the road is a brown wooden sign that says \"McConnel Lake Provincial Park\". The only tricky thing is that sometimes this sign is taken down in the winter months... it is BEFORE stake lake.",
