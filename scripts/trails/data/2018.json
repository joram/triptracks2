    "description": "NTS Map: 083H10Elevation gain - zero.This trail is located in  Elk Island National Park.  This is trail #1 of the park trail system.  A nice 2.5 to 3 hour hike through relatively flat terrain.  In the winter, it is nice for cross country skiing, although I'm not sure if it's groomed.  Lots of wildlife, especially moose.  Winter is the best time to see moose because the leaves are off the trees.  In the summer, be prepared to encounter free range bison.(Editor's note - Hayburger Trail is named after a family that homesteaded in the park until the 1930s. The trail crosses a black spruce bog where boreal birds and moose may be observed. The trail also winds through open aspen forest and meadows, the preferred habitat of the plains bison. Remain on the trail, as there are hidden areas of quicksand in some of the large meadows.)",
    "directions": "Entrance to Elk Island National Park is from Highway 16, east of Edmonton.  Drive north through the park gate (a fee is charged for admission to the park).  The trailhead is well marked (Hayburger Trail) and is on the east side of the road.",
