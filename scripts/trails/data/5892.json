    "description": "Climbing to the Junction of King Canyon and Wasson peak trails you encounter a variety of desert vegetation (be careful it bites as in having all kinds of prickles and thorns).  Didn't see any rattlesnakes but they are common in the area.The first portion winds through the desert down to Sweetwater Valley then you work your way along the older section of the trail. It's rocky and rugged in places. There are spectular views of Tucscon and the mountains from the trail.Once at the saddle there is an optional 1.2 mile hike to Wasson Peak. It's the highest peak in the Tucson mountains and offers great views in all directions.For guided hiking and biking trips in Arizona, check out aoa-adventures.com.",
