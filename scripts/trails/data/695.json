    "description": "NTS Map:92B11.  Mount Douglas Park encompasses a wide range of trails, leading from the beach at Cordova Bay to the spectacular 228 metre summit. Although cycling is prohibited on the park trails, cyclists can branch off the Lochside Trail and enjoy the steep 1.5 km ride up Churchill Drive to the summit parking lot.Parking is available at the Cordova Bay picnic site, the park summit, and at the base of Churchill drive. Some of the park trails start on Cordova Bay Road; however there is no parking in this area.The Merriman Trail to the summit has steep sections that can be slippery, the Irvine and Norn Trails are easy.At the summit, the 360 degree view of Victoria, the Saanich Peninsula, and the Malahat is superb; on clear days the Cascade and Olympic ranges, Gulf and San Juan Islands are viewable.The sand beach of Cordova Bay is well worth a visit, as are the picnic and playground areas.  A large stone fireplace and picnic tables makes this a great rallying point for group trips. There is GPS data attached to this trail (see \"download GPS\"), which if loaded into your GPS can help you find route points.",
