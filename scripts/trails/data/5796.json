    "description": "Nice little trail to the top of Black Cap Mountain that will offer you great views of Conway and the surrounding areas.  There is some bare rock at the top that will require a little more effort but overall this is a pretty easy to moderate trail.  Watch the forest canopy change from balsam fir as you leave from the trail head to beech and mixed hardwood for much of the trail and then back to balsam fir as you make your way to the top.    The top is above Mt. Cranmore so you will get a nice view of that summit.\r\rSpring, Summer, Fall parking is at the trail head on Hurricane Mountain Road.  This road is closed about a mile before the trail head in the winter, so any winter access will add some extra mileage to the trip and make the difficulty level raise to a higher level moderate or difficult.",
    "directions": "From Route 302/Rt 16 in Intervale follow Hurricane Mountain Road east for 3.6 miles and trail head is on the right.",
