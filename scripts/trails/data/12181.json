    "description": "The Musquodoboit Trailway section of the Trans Canada Trail is a 15-km (9-mi) trail from Musquodoboit Harbour to Meagher?s Grant in the Eastern Shore region.This trail, which is the first section of the Trans Canada Trail designated in Nova Scotia, runs along an old rail bed with picnic shelters, benches and pit toilets located at intervals. Three backcountry loops off the main trail (varying lengths) offer spectacular views; the challenging Granite Ridge wilderness trails wind through rugged topography.Trail activities include walking, hiking, cycling, snowshoeing and cross-country skiing.We went for a short jont from the gate at Bayers Mills Rd to the first bridge crossing where the second entrance to the Admirls Lake trail meets the main trail.  It is roughly 2.3 kms to the bridge and the trail is in excellent condition.",
    "directions": "Leave dartmouth via Main Street which truns into HWY 107 until you reach Musquodoboit.  Take HWY 357 North and turn right on Bayers Mills Rd.  There is parking at the end off the road where the trail connects.  Enjoy.",
