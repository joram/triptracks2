    "description": "A  very nice hike through semi-arid landscapes (cacti, rattle-snake, etc.) with spectacular views of the valley.\r\rThere are many other trails inside the loop and if you want to shorten your hike, there are many possibilities to do so. If you want to take your time and enjoy the view, the longest loop should probably take about 3 hours to complete.",
    "directions": "From Kamloops downtown, head to Kamloops Airport, stay on the main road to the Kamloops Lake, with the rail track on your right. As soon as you will cross the rail track, there will be a small parking, this is the starting point.",
