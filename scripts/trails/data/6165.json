    "description": "The trailhead is hard to spot if you don't know what you are looking for but there are a number of large rocks on the west side of the road which are a good indicator along with a white CRD sign.This trail leading up Mount McDonald will take 30-45 minutes to complete but it is rather steep. There are a couple of hand lines in places that can be used but are not necessary. Bring plenty of water since the trail is very exposed to the sun. The view from the top is great!",
    "directions": "From Trans-Canada highway, turn onto Westshore Parkway and turn right through the traffic circle. Follow the road until you get to humpback road where there will be large trees down centreline of the road. At the T-intersection, turn right and park in the Mount Wells parking lot or continue down the road to a pullout.From the Sooke highway, turn onto Humpback road and follow the road until you reach a pullout close to the trailhead.",
