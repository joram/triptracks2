    "description": "Some very tight singletrack, almost too tight to be fun in my opinion..  But in any case, someone did put some time into these trails and they are singletrack.",
    "directions": "From Fredericton, cross the Saint John river on Westmorland Street bridge, take a right on Union Street, look for left on Gibson, take that left, turns into Canada Street, left on Holybrook Road after you pass Marysville Baptist Church (note this might be the second or 3rd church you pass!!!!), left on Hallet, right on Power Road, see water tower, gate, park there, trailhead is on your right, or left..",
