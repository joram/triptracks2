    "description": "NTS Map: 083C01This 3.84-mile out-and-back trail makes an excellent evening excursion for intermediate riders. After crossing a high-quality suspension bridge over the North Saskatchewan River, the trail follows a good, wide track to a second crossing. Turn right at the junction, and the trail becomes a narrow singletrack as it climbs toward the falls. \r\n\r\nNOTE: In some areas there are very steep slopes/cliffs and also narrow paths, which may make it very difficult when wet or snow covered.",
    "directions": "The trail is found along Highway 11, the David Thompson Highway, at the Siffleur Falls day-use area.",
