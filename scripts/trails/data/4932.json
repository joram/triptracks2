    "description": "This is the ridge only. Other trails are named incorrectly and include a portion of the Powderface Creek Trail. \nThe trail start as a root filled trail winding uphill and you will definitely need to push your bike for parts of it. The trail then goes in the trees on the East side of the ridge, comes over and onto the West side of the ridge for a very rocky ride, before switching back over the ridge again at a metal post marker. The next section is a downhill root filled ride that can be muddy after wet weather. You will come to some uphill, followed by a grass field downhill section. The final section is a fairly steep root and rock downhill section that will dump you at the South Trailhead. \nBring water, sunscreen and snacks, and watch out for horse droppings. You are likely to see hikers along the trail but the final section attracts many people attempting to climb the closest peak so bring a bear(/people) bell to announce yourself.  \nThis trail tends to keep snow, particularly in the trees, for quite awhile so spring is probably not a good time to attempt the bike ride.",
    "directions": "South Trailhead is where the pavement ends on Highway 66, and the dirt begins for Powderface Road. North Trailhead (higher elevation) is approximately 7 km in Powderface Road after the pavement ends. There is an alternate start point downhill from here, further in the road, across from the Ford Creek start point if you want more of a challenge.",
