    "description": "Drive Hwy 99 towards Squamish. Turn onto Mamquam FSR.",
    "directions": "Reset your odometer on sign saying \"Mamquam FSR\" and drive 7 K. Required FSR spur will be on your right. If you're driving 2 WD sedan park it there and start hiking for 4WD you may drive at least up to 750m elevation. First fork after ~500m from the beginning keep right on next ~1.5k keep left. This is where I parked my car close to the tree with blue pained word \"MAIN\", but soon after I found there is no reason to park a 4WD car her since road is in good shape.",
