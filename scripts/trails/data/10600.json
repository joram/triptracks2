    "description": "Short hike to a hidden waterfall in pastoral NB.  Driving on the highway you will see a good looking waterfall upstream from the bridge.  It drop about 15ft and its called Briggs Falls\r\rHowever if you follow the road east and park at the top of the small rise you will be rewarded after a short hike by a beautiful and secluded waterfall.  Traverse the hay field by using the track.  At the end of the field enter the evergreen forest and prepare to go down an abrupt ravine.  At the base of the ravine lies the beautiful 30ft waterfall.  Looks like the locals have a catch and release policy at this spot.\r\r",
    "directions": "Highway 95 south of Woodstock.  Take exit for Highway 540 going North.  Follow this road through the village of Jackson Falls (small falls underneath bridge) and then turn right at  46.245377\u00b0, -67.759593\u00b0.  Briggs Falls are upstream from the bridge while the easiest access to the lower falls are accessed from approximately  46.246377\u00b0, -67.754370\u00b0.\r",
