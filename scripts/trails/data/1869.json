    "description": "This is second part of a 3.5 hour loop with Juniper Trail being the first half of the loop. \r\n\r\nThe scenery is not as nice as Juniper Trail but it's worth doing the loop instead of backtracking.",
    "directions": "Park the car by Radium Hot Springs Pools (N 50.38.094, W 116.02.479). You don't need a National Park Pass to park there as of spring 2005.\r\n\r\nTake Juniper Trail. At the end of Juniper Trail, cross the road and that's where Redstreak Campground Trail starts.",
