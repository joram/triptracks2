    "description": "NTS Map: 92G11. The Stawamus Chief near Squamish BC has 3 peaks, 1st (or South), 2nd (or Centre) and 3rd (or North).The 1st is lowest (approx 600 m), easiest and most popular. Avoid it, especially on weekends, due to the high (people) traffic.My preferred is Peaks 2 and 3, with an additional bonus that they are linked, and consequently you can do a circuit and hike both in 1 trip. The preferred route is to go up to Peak 3 first, enjoy the view and have lunch there, and then back via Peak 2.When crossing over from 3rd to 2nd, make sure you take a look down the gorge between the 2 peaks (careful, don't go too close, it's probably 500 m down if you miss the first step).",
    "directions": "Drive hway 99 north from Vancouver to Shannon Falls (approx 45 minutes). You can park and pay ($3) at Shannon Falls Prov Park, and get a close-up look at the falls, 3rd highest in BC. Or, drive 1.2 kms north from the traffic light at Shannon Falls and park in the unmarked parking lot on the right (east) side of the hway. You'll note a trail leading out from the northeast corner of this parking lot. Head up that trail. It's shorter than the trail from Shannon Falls PP.At approx the 300 m elevation level, you'll see signs for various trails. Follow the trail for 3rd Peak. There'll be some easy fairly flat parts, but also some quite steep rough sections. Be prepared.The GPS track has the trail via the 2nd peak, because the tree cover along the 3rd peak trail prevented recording the track along that trail. However, it does show the trail from Peak 3 to Peak 2, which can be confusing, and shows most of the trail back down to Shannon Falls PP parking lot.Have a great hike 8-))",
