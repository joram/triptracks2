    "description": "SHAFT is all single track, beginning with open and fast flowing trail through light forest before slowly transitioning into a little steeper terrain with many switchbacks. The bottom half of the trail is characterized by long traverses along the side hill and big ,swooping switchbacks as you traverse down the mountain. Use caution on the few steep sections near the bottom of the trail and watch for riders as you merge with T-Dub.",
    "directions": "To access the trailhead, drive to the end of the Moose mountain road and head directly west towards the gated road to the well site. Push another 100 meters up the gated road where you will find the entrance to T-Dub to your left and the entrance to SHAFT just a few meters past it, also on your left. SHAFT finishes on the last few hundred meters of T-Dub which will then flow onto the Canyon Creek road, where you pedal south (left) towards the Ing?s mine parking lot. where your driver should wait.",
