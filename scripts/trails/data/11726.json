    "description": "Rotary Park is on the outskirts of the town of Summerside. It's mainly a flat gravel groomed circuit of paths located just outside the property limits of their hospital, and makes the most of the forested space that is bordered by ritzy subdivisions and farm fields.Dispersed among the groomed gravel paths, are bits of single track that go through the woods. The terrain is flat, and the paths, tame, but for a city limits find, it would be a great spot for snowshoeing and classic skiing, trail running, and beginner mtn bike riding. Come Winter, an ideal spot for fatbike riding.Just past the park gates, I found an odd juxtaposition of ghetto shacks nearly up against the back yards of an upscale subdivision. Looked pretty seedy, and I didn't want to linger there too long. Good thing it's away from any of the beaten paths within the park.It was a fun little find in a place where I didn't know trails existed.Shannon BurtPEI",
    "directions": "Off of Granville Street, take Walker Drive, heading east, toward the Hospital. The enterance to the park has a wrought iron gate and parking further back.",
