    "description": "This is a short hike to do if you happen to travel down Digby Neck.  Not far from Sandy cove lies a unnamed brook which tumbles down a cliff giving an impressive 60 ft plus waterfall.The hike starts on an old woods road close to a house and you immediately hear the roar of the fall.  You veer on a secondary path to your right and then you come up to the top of the fall. There is a rope to take you down to the base of the first ten footer drop and then it is a made scramble the rest of the way down if you want to see the fall from the bottom.The brook then tumbles down another 6ft further downstream on it's way to TR's cove...which gave the name to the fall itself.",
    "directions": "Route 217 on Digby Neck.  Turn on Sandy Cove Rd and then turn on old post road parking at its conclusion. The stream lies a bit further ahead on the old road.",
