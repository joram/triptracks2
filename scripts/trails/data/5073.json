    "description": "Trail goes up  along a logging road, then goes through a swampy area.  From here it goes approx 40% grade to Drum Lake.  This lake is only a pond and only a foot deep.  There are 2 marked trails , but stay in the open areas so you don't get caught going into the rock slide area.",
    "directions": "Go past the Coquihalla toll  booth, heading East, and go approx 15 mins to the Juliet exit.  Stay to the right and go under the hi-way, and go approx 7.5 kms up the road, staying to the left when you cross the bridge at around 4km.  The trailhead is about 1.5 kms past the 7.5km mark, but with a low clearance van, I coulcn't make it.  A 4x4 would easily make it to the trailhead, when going up, stay to the right when any side roads appear.  The trailhead is easily marked by a forest service sign.",
