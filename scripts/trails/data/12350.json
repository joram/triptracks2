    "description": "This is a series of falls that are located off the Manager's Park in Londonderry.  Of course if you just follow the park you only have a view from the top of the falls.  instead follow my gps track to the stream and move upstream to see unclose the three sets of lovely falls.  On the way there you will notice some sand glass on the slope as well as iron in the river.   The track down the slop is a bit steep but manageable...if you are worried just follow the stream up from the main road instead.do not follow the track on the west side of the river.....I was looking for some adits but they have collapsed",
    "directions": "In Londonderry, Take Westchester Rd North and turn left at the managers Park entrance",
