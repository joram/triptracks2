    "description": "Near Mabou on Cape Breton Island, a roadway sign beckon me to explore?the sign was; Glenora Falls.\r\rNow this is a super short hike but the reward is a waterfall of about 60ft located about 200m from a year round passable road.  Setting off from the bridge, you follow the stream?s edge going downstream.  The forest surrounding the stream is made up of beautiful, mature hardwoods.  Within a minute your hear the roar of the fall.  The stream at this point has carved itself a deep and narrow canyon.  Of course, this can be the end of the hike as this viewpoint will afford you a nice look at the waterfall and gorge.  You will also notice a faint trail that descends into the gorge.  This trail is very very steep and should not be attempted but by sure footed mountain goats.  There is a rope at one point but never trust a rope you haven?t set yourself.\r\r",
    "directions": "Drive on Highway 19 towards Mabou.  North of Mabou you should see a road sign for Glenora Falls.  Turn left on Glenora Falls Rd.  Park at the bridge over the stream about 500m from highway 19.\r",
