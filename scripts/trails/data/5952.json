    "description": "A mad sweet DH trail full of crazy built up stunts.  B-lines around most stuff.  Fast and flowy, with small and medium jumps all over too!!! What a blast.  This trail definitely requires a good bike and some skills.  This is the mail trail in the postal mountain bike area.",
    "directions": "Old Vernon road off highway 97 just north of the Kelowna airport.  Turn right behind the airport, then left up postal Rd.  Stay left when you get to an intersection.  there is parking at the 1km mark.  Time includes riding up the fire rd, but shuttling is recommended.",
