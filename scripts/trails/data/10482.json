    "description": "Starts with a crossing of the Lynn Canyon Suspension Bridge and heads through an area that can be quite muddy and sections of dense tree roots.  You will come out and cross Lillooet Rd and enjoy some downhill and an open landscape before starting a long winding climb that becomes quite steep for the last third until you reach the peak at around the 8km mark.  It is then almost all downhill to Deep Cove with some steepish descents, but mostly a perfect decline for jogging.  Save some energy just after the rocky outlook at Deep Cove (which is very popular so expect a lot of people on the track for this last section) as there are some steep inclines getting back up and down to Deep Cove.  You'd be crazy not to stop for Donuts in Deep Cove!",
