    "description": "This is a off-trail trail in the Cape Breton Highlands National Park.  Starting off at the parking lot of the Presqu'ile(where you see the sea stack as you look towards Cheticamp in the distance), you follow the edge of the cliffs and enter in and out of a very dense white spruce forest.  The trail used to follow the edge of the cliffs but erosion has eaten away at it and so now it is a bit harder to follow.After about 200m of this bushwack you come out to this beautiful barren with 360 dgree views of the Park, cheticamp and the gulf of St Lawrence.  You can easily walk here and follow the ridgeline and go around the whole Presqu'ile.",
    "directions": "Cabot trail into CB Highlands National Park.  Just passed the Grande Falaise turn into the parking lot of the Presqu'ile where there is a nice rocky beach and a view toawrds the sea stack.",
