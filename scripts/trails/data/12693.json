    "description": "A trail from Cabin Lake to the crash site of a plane years before. For a good description go the geocaching website and search for  GC9284. There is also a geocache at the crash site. About 2 miles from Cabin Lake it is 4x4 only or you can hike it or bike it.",
    "directions": "Access is usually summer and fall only via the Prospect Creek forest service from Highway #8 near Merritt B.C. . From the Cabin Lake campsite there is no need for the hard scramble over the mountain as indicated by your GPS . Follow the trail from the far end of the lake to the crash site.",
