    "description": "This is a nice quick hike that is great for people new to MDI.  From the summit you get a great view in all directions and can get a quick \"lay of the land\" feel for the island.  The hike can easily be elongated for a more thorough workout by summitting the nearby St. Sauveur rather than returning directly to the parking lot.  My profile picture was taken at this summit.  Somes Sound, Echo Lake, Norembega Mtn and the entire South shore of the island including the Cranberries can be taken in from up here.",
    "directions": "On Rt. 102 about 2/3's of the way down Echo Lake.  About 3 miles South of the Rt. 198 junction and 3 miles North of Southwest Harbor.",
