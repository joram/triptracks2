    "description": "A very interesting network of trails that give amazing views of the very scenic town of Salvage (sal VAGE with a short A and soft G) and the surrounding bay, islands, and heads.  Really, a beautiful town on Bonavista Bay that is a dictionary definition of a scenic Newfoundland fishing village.\nThe trails are a network and include a couple viewing lookout platforms, a couple biffys, some boardwalk, some interpretive info storyboards and great signage.  You can add them together, poke around and explore, sit and stare, you name it, these trails will let you kill an hour or a day.  Take your lunch and enjoy it in any number of places (just remember to take all the bits back out with you, the trails are *very* clean).\nThe trails are a great story in themselves, they were built to help employment and provide options and opportunity for the town after a fire in the fish plant.  They alone are well worth a trip to Salvage (but the rest of the town is picture perfect too).",
    "directions": "Go to Salvage.  East on hiway 310 from the #1 about 60km South of Gander, past the top edge of Terra Nova National Park.\nFollow the main road all the way through town to the water, following it as it curves to the right and just past the fish plant, look for a gravel path heading up.  Park somewhere near there and start up.",
