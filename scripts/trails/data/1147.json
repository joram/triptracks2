In fall the larches are amazing. Mount Rowe is accessible as a side trip (easy scramble) from the northwest corner of upper Rowe Lake. Photo below center is Rowe Meadow from trail to the upper lakes. Photo below right is from Upper Lakes back down the valley and over the ledge to the Lower Lake. In spring, a large volume of water cascades over this ledge (bottom left photo), but usually dries up by the end of June.Current conditions:\r\n\r",
