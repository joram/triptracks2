    "description": "Out in the middle of an impressive Acadian forest lies an unknown 40ft waterfall.  The way to get there is on an old logging road as you make your way up to the top of the Cobequid Hills...you could use a mtn bike for this part to cut down on the time and you would have an awesome downhill on the way back out!At the end of the road or so, you will need to navigate through the woods to the fall.  nothing around the falls prepares you for the sight as the terrain is not very steep.  The ferns cover most of the forest floor and it makes for an enjoyable walk through the woods.",
    "directions": "Drive to Lornevale (near Londonderry) and on the mines Bass river Road and turn on the dirt road located close to the 90 degree turn in the road.  The road is at; N45 28 03.4 W63 40 54.4 and the fall at N45 29 03.6 W63 41 57.9.",
