    "description": "We did this in July 2017 as a day trip from Jo9 (Larry?s Camp). We spent 2 nights at the Jo9 campground which is best accessed from Moose Meadows. The day trip starts with a 6.3 km ascent to Mystic Pass (2285 Metres) followed by a 3.6 km descent to the junction for Mystic Lake and a final 0.5 km access trail to the lake. Then there is also an opportunity to use a poorly defined trail to the other side of the lake along the east side.Great views and few visitors.",
    "directions": "The trailhead is at the Moose Meadows parking lot on the 1A, just west of Johnston Canyon. The campground is 9 km from the 1A, or 3 km beyond the Ink Pots.",
