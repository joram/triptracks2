    "description": "Put in at Clam River Bridge, Map 1N6, Zone 22, N5245410, E317494. Watch for 3 sets of mini falls 2 km downstream, we lined canoe here. Paddle on to Ripple Pond, cross ~ 1 km to west end, enter Colinet River. Most rapids are ok to run, use your judgement, we are amateurs and did well. Water levels can determine the challenge, of course. Paddle ~ 16 km to the Colinet River Bridge, where the river enters St. Marys Bay.  Map 1N4 Zone 22 N5232451, E306354\r\n\r\nRecommend Maps 1:50,000 1N6, 1N5, & 1N4",
