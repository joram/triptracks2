    "description": "This trail can be shortened to accommodate less time.  The full trail passes bailey's chute, Marcus Falls, Myanth Falls, and a mosquito breeding pond called west lake.  Bring bug spray.  The trail is well marked and easy to follow.  there are some short switchbacks as you climb away from the river.  There may be downed trees, depending on how recently a maintenance crew was there, so this is not a sandle wearing trail.  cool views of some smaller falls, and interesting temperature changes as you hike through the dense forest.",
    "directions": "Watch for the Bailey's Chute parking area on the East side of Clearwater Valley road.  The trail immediately crosses the road.  The trailhead is about 56 km north from the junction of the Clearwater Valley road and the Yellowhead Highway intersection at Clearwater BC.",
