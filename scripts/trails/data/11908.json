    "description": "Tis is an area of the province that doesn't have that many waterfalls compared to other parts.  I took a chance on this brook after looking at some topographical maps that were promising.  the other thing that this brook had going for it for a waterfall is that it drains a lake so there is probably water flowing in it most of the time.Setting off from the dirt road you can hear a faint roar but it's only because of the perched culvert.  The forest at first is a mixture of hardwood with small softwoood to get into your face.  After 15 minutes or less you finally enter a very nice and mature conifer forest where the canopy is high over your head.The falls lies just ahead where the stream loses about 45ft into two plunging cascade-falls.  In early June...it is very buggy so wear a long sleeve or take a DEET shower before heading off.",
