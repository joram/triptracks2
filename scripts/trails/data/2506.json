    "description": "A great beginner route since it starts at the front doors of the outfitter and registration office.  Paddle north from Canoe Lake, through Joe, Teepee & Littledoe Lakes to camp on Tom Tompson Lake on first night.  Paddle north through Bartlett, Willow, Sunbeam, Treefrog & Jay Lakes to spend night two on Burnt Island Lake.  Go south through the \"Joe\" lakes bake to Canoe Lake.  Extend it to an easy 4 day by camping on Littledoe, Sunbeam and Burnt Island Lakes.  Book in advance since this is also a popular weekend route.",
    "directions": "Accessed from the Hwy.60 corridor.  At 14km from West Gate take road north to the Portage Store.  Put in at Canoe Lake.",
