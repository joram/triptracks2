    "description": "A short hike in the woods near Ashdale will lead you to a beautiful 30ft waterfall.  I wasn?t aware of this waterfall until a very nice person that leads waterfalling expeditions told me about it. I had previously explored a lot of this area without finding this hidden gem.\r\rFrom the main road leading to Ashdale, walk on the dirt road that leads to the South of Ashdale Rd.  Walk approximately 289m until you cross a wooden bridge over a stream.  This is the stream that will eventually have a waterfall on it.  After the bridge you come out to a large clearing.  Continue to the end of the clearing in a straight line and enter the woodland.  The wood consists mainly of small evergreen trees with a few patches of hardwoods (mainly birch).  As soon as you enter the woods you should be able to hear the roar of the fall.  The fall is located about 100m into the woods in front of you.  Conversely, once you enter the large clearing you can veer to the right until you hit the stream.  Follow the stream in a downstream direction until you reach the fall.  The descent into the ravine to the base of the fall is extremely steep so be very careful.  At the bottom of the ravine you can stop and admire this hidden gem.\r\r",
