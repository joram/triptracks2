    "description": "NTS Map: 082J15The trail starts immediately in a forested area. Go left at the first junction, then take a right at the Nihahi Ridge sign. You then navigate through switchbacks until you reach an open meadow and are rewarded with scenic views of the mountains. Continue on this trail which starts heading west. At this point you start ascending a steeper slope, with one area having a roped handrail. A few more stretches of uphill takes you to a scenic viewpoint of the Elbow Valley. This area can get quite windy, but there are trees in which you can take shelter and enjoy a meal. If you are comfortable with scrambling, and walking on an exposed area with loose rocks, you can summit the ridge by hiking another 400 meters.",
    "directions": "Drive west on Elbow Falls Trail (Hwy 66) for 29 km. (Be aware part of this road is closed from Dec 1 to May 14). Turn left into the access road for Little Elbow Recreation Area. Turn left at the \"Trailhead Parking.\" Walk down the gravel fire road southwest past the Little Elbow Campground Loop C, D & E or take the Little Elbow Trail along the north bank of the river until you reach a gate with a Kiosk which has maps of trails of the area. Continue down this road until you see a sign on the right indicating the trailhead for Nihahi Ridge. There are two locations to access this trail.",
