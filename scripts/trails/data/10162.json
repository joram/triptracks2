    "description": "A pleasant uphill and downhill hike from the Sulphur Gates entrance to Willmore Wilderness Park to an amazing waterfall.\rWide trails used by mountain bikers, horseback riders and hikers.\rIt took us 2.5 - 3 hours to complete a walk in and walk out with time spent taking pictures at the waterfalls and a quick lunch.\rIf you are considering this trail as a mountain bike ride, be fore warned that the trail does have loose rock on the hills which would make for a more difficult ride up and down the hills.\rUnfortunately my upload doesn't have the first part of the hike, but it was very straight forward.\rWhen walking you will come to a fork in the trail marked by a post with an antler attached, stay on the right fork, not long after that you will hear the rumble of the falls.",
    "directions": "Take the sulphar gates road to the far end.  There is a lookout for the river valley and Sulphur Gates on the left and on the right is the entrance to Wilmore Wilderness Park and the way to Eaton Falls.\rThe trail starts at the south end of the parking lot and continues along the wide trail.",
