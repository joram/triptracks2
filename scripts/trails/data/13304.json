    "description": "This is a bushwack hike to a small but pretty waterfall on Barrys Brook in Aulds Cove.  this brook drains a few large lakes all of which have dams.  The dams do not have falls associated with them but I saw an interesting feature in google earth.  I followed the brook from the lake and dam and found a pretty little fall nestled in a mixed forest.",
    "directions": "In aulds Cove.  turn on highway 344 towards Mulgrave.  Park at the top of the hill, opposite the quarry at; 45\u00b038'14.6\"N 61\u00b025'56.2\"W.  there is an old woods road leading you towards the fall.  The falls are at; 45\u00b038'4.61\"N,  61\u00b026'22.02\"W  ...easiest to do with a gps.",
