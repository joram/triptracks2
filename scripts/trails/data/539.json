    "description": "In November of 1956 at TCA flight from Vancouver to Calgary crashed into Mt. Slesse killing all 62 aboard.  In 1995 a plaque was erected to honour those who lost their lives, and the area was declared a commemorative site.  The route is out in the open following an old road, and takes you not only to the plaque but also to a breath-taking vista of Mt. Slesse and its neighbours. Note:  The trail does continue along the road to its end, where a rough trail leads you up a ridge to the base of Slesse's rock slopes (another 4 hrs return). The picture above is from our climbing section, which shows a route up Slesse for climbers.",
    "directions": "Highway 1 Exit 119A (Sardis/Vedder).  Go south on Vedder Rd. until you reach the Vedder Bridge.  Turn left onto Chilliwack Lake Rd.  Set you odometer to \"0\" at the Vedder Bridge.  Turn right at 31km, just past the Riverside Recreation Site, onto the Chilliwack South Forest Service Rd. \"0\" your odometer again, cross bridge and at 400m turn right.  Follow this road (Nesakwatch Creek is on your right) for 5.6km where you'll see a signpost, parking area and clearing, all on your right.  Walk through the open area to the footbridge over the creek, and you'll find the trail fairly obvious from this point on.  (Maintained by the Valley Outdoor Association).",
