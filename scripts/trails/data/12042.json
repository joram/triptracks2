    "description": "A great day hike from Elfin Lakes campground. We did the Gargoyles first, then went down to Lava Lake and finally up the Little Diamond Head at 2050 m. It is not a difficult hike, however, the final scramble to the peak is along an edge of a steep loose slope and one should stay back from the edge. The peak is literally a diamond tip with steep slopes on two of its three sides. We scrambled down into the valley and returned to Elfin from the creek - would not recommend that, there is no trail and one ends up in a rock field.",
    "directions": "Starting from Elfin Lakes go north towards the Gargoyles, it is well marked. Getting to Elfin Lakes is described in Jack Bryceland's \"103 Hikes in SW BC\", hike number 22.",
