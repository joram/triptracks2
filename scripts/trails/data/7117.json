    "description": "A short loop from the West Bragg Creek parking area in Kananaskis country.  Named after a now defunct youth hostle that used to be here back in the day (just what day we're not sure, it's been a while), this trails is a short loop winding through the local forest and gentle hills.  \nIt is signed, easy to follow, and a wide path generally and should be suitable for beginners and for people looking for a short ski.  It can be muddy in places.\nTrails in this area are designed for mainly winter cross country skiing. In other seasons trail can be walked. It's a short walk in the forest and no much else.  The adjacent SnowShoe Hare trail is a designated Snow Shoe trail.",
    "directions": "Take Hiway 22 (or hiway 8 from Calgary west) to Bragg Creek. Cross the only bridge and turn left at the T. Follow that all the way out (9km) to the Provincial Recreation area (road turns into gravel at rec area gates). \nFollow the gravel to the parking lot at the end. Trail starts from the middle of the north side of parking.",
