    "description": "A great, true mountain biking experience with an amazing view into Canyon Creek Canyon.  This is a fair amount of road but with serious singletrack and rocks 'n roots mixed in.  A definate DO!\nAlong the edge of the canyon is some serious exposure (to falling that is) and I'd strongly recommend to have good equipment, good tires, not go when it is raining, etc.\nIt does start with several (9?) km of riding up a (closed to vehicles) road at 2% grade but it is still a scenic route and the trees provide some welcome shade.  There is a small canyon enroute but nothing like you'll see in several more km.\nThis trail is near:",
    "directions": "Go to Golden, South on hiway 95 to (6.6km from the bridge downtown) to Nickelson Road on the right.  Turn right and in 900m turn right on Canyon Creek Road and cross the bridge.\nThere are a couple trailheads, to use the one we used, followed this road up to Sander Lake campground and used the parking lot a few hundred meters past the campground.  Start riding up the road (called the 2% trail I believe) and cross under the locked gate that is up a km or so.  It will be about 6.4km from the parking lot to the official start of Canyon.",
