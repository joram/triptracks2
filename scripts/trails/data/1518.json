    "description": "This group of trails is very handy to the city and for years has been used by local family hikers, dog-walkers, dudes on bikes, etc. Long Lake itself is quite lovely as are the softwood stands, exposed granite bedrock, babbling brooks, glacial erratics and other natural features of the region which have become hard to find within city limits. Its a great place year-round although a bit soggy in the spring.",
    "directions": "From Halifax, drive through the Armdale Rotary (carefully) to St. Margaret's Bay Road and after 3 or so kilometers turn left into the parking lot.",
