    "description": "A hike to an unknown but beautiful beach located close to Lockeport, South Shore, Nova Scotia.  The land apart from the house at the end of the road is now all protected as part of NS Nature Trust.  The trail starts as an ATV trail which is not muddy.  The trail traverses a salt march setting before heading to the beach.  The beach itself is a barrier beach of more than 2km long with no signs of civilization anywhere.",
    "directions": "Highway 103.  Exit 23 towards Lockeport.  Turn left on W Sable Rd to its conclusion passed Little Harbour",
