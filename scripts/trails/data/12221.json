    "description": "This is a super easy hike to tack on when visiting other falls in the Bridgewater area (Veinot brook especially).  The hike is mostly in an open area and within a few minutes you come up to the fall with what looks like a deep basin at its base.",
    "directions": "In Bridgewater, take King St North and park at N44.38344 W64.52501",
