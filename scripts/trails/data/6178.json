    "description": "This trail is around Mt Rundle. Very interesting, The only difficult part is when getting close to Canmore close to the nordic centre, there is a huge climb towards Whitemans Pond. The most interesting segment is after the pond, the trails is a bit downhill and gets very fast.",
    "directions": "Not complicated: just park there and follow the trail !\rN51.16976 W115.51198",
