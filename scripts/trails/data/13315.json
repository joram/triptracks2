    "description": "This is a cool little series of trails located in the Russell Lake area of Dartmouth.  I noticed some flagging tape by some power lines...follow it up and saw some hand painted signs describing a series of different trails.  The terrain is mostly flat or with a very slight slope.   The rocks and roots are numerous but not as bad as other areas of NS.",
    "directions": "Drive to the end of Mt Hope Ave in Russel Lake area.  Park right at the end of ir...passes the Mazda dealership.   Across the way is a power line corridor...the trails are in the woods right after the lines.  Look for some orange flagging tape.",
