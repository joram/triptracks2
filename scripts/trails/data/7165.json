    "description": "A pleasant hike, which involves approx 1/2 walking on winding island roads and 1/2 on trails on bluffs overlooking Georgeson Bay and up to the summit of Mount Galiano (315 m. elevation).\nWe had 600 m. total ascent during the day, so a good workout regarless. Beautiful views of Active Pass and Mayne Island from Burrill Rd and the Bluffs, and of Trincomali Channel, Georgia Straight, Prevost Island and other islands from the summit of Mount Galiano.\nWe got lucky, as the island was covered with snow on November 20, 2010 when we did this hike, making our hike even more beautiful. \nPrint the map or download the GPS data and follow the trail. Don't forget a stop at the Hummingbird Inn on your way back. From the Inn, walk along the Sturdies Bay Trail that parallels the road on your way back to the ferry terminal.",
