    "description": "As the name suggests, not only is the river small but the waterfall is too!  although in this part of NS you cannot ask for much....the geology is just not conducive for waterfall formation.  This one at least is a nice walk on an overgrown ATV trail until you hot a really small stream.  The water was almost non existant as this is the driest summer ever (2016).  However if you do go here after a rainfall and follow the stream upstream for a few minutes, you will be rewarded by a 15 ft fall.",
    "directions": "Highly 357 to Elderbank.  turn on Elderbank back Rd and then on Higgins Lake Rd.  Drive to its conclusion and follow the ate path all the way to the stream",
