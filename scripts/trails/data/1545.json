    "description": "NTS Map: 083G09This is the easiest of 4 trails in Chickakoo Lake Recreation Area in Parkland County just 25 minutes west of Edmonton, AB.  Activities allowed on this trail are hiking, biking, snowshowing, and cross country sking.  For the most part this trail 3m wide, 1.3 km long, and is a great starter trail for families with young children, or older folks who want to walk in nature on a flat and fairly even surfaced trail.  There are lots of picnic tables and benches to stop at and watch the beavers and muskrats at work or the loons and red-neck grebes fishing.  There is a boat launch and pit toilets in both the main parking lot and at the boat launch.  The only downside is the number of people not picking up after their dogs.  It give the rest of us dog owners a bad name.",
    "directions": "From Edmonton, go west on Hwy 16 to Stony Plain.  Turn right (north) on Sec Hwy 779 (rge rd 10).  Go north and past the first sign for Chickakoo Rec Area.  Turn left (west) on Twp Rd 540.  You will now see signs for the Rec Area.  Turn left (south) on Rge Rd 13.  Stay on the main road but keep left at the fork.  This will take you into either the boat launch parking or the main parking lot.",
