    "description": "South Kaibab Trail approx. 13 km down hill on well groomed but steep trail (with no time for warm up and it is not often you start out a hike all down hill, so don't over do it and ruin the trip). There is no water on this trail therefore you must carry it with you,they recommend 4 litres per person. Stop often and enjoy the views they are continually changing. We stayed at Bright Angel Campground just off Colorado River with good facilities, drinking water and a cookhouse that you can book your meals (must reserve). Next Morning we headed out on Bright Angel Trail to Indian Gardens Camp approx 4 hours along Colorado River and up through Ravine to Camp. There are facilities and drinking water at Indian Gardens. The next day head up Bright Angel Trail to Canyon South Rim approx. 5 hours and about 3300 feet of elevation gain so take your time and use the rest stop eat and drink lots. Well groomed Trail many, many switch backs. On both trails you will be sharing the trails with the Mule Teams so be prepared to make room.

    "directions": "As you will require a back country permit to overnight camp in the Grand Canyon please contact the Ranger Station and get directions all information about trails from them.",
