    "description": "A surprisingly easy and accessible fall close to Fredericton.  From the side of the highway you can either take the main ATV path of follow the small trails on the side of the creek.  After only a few minute you come up to the top of the 25 ft waterfall.  It is an interesting fall because of a small cave like structure on the side of the main fall.  The rock apron juts out right over the fall.",
    "directions": "Fredericton bypass (highway 8) towards Woodstock.  Park approximately at 45.937864, -66.721022 and follow creek downstream from this point.",
