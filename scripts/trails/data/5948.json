    "description": "To access this trail you must first ford the Panther River. The trail is well defined as it is used by horses and is easy to follow. There are a few river crossings that you can either ford or bushwack around as we did.",
    "directions": "Drive west from Sundre,Alberta 8kms. Turn left(south) onto the \"coal camp road\". Drive 25kms. on pavement, then another 28kms. on good gravel roads to the Mtn. Aire Lodge. Head west from the lodge 8kms. to a pull out and park. The Panther River and trail head are just across the road.",
