    "description": "An awesome network of trails, primarily aimed at the freerider but enjoyable by anyone.  Lots of different sized stunts, and open enough to ride around anything over your abilities.  \r\rSome larger than average jumps are to be had if you're up for it.\r\rAn excellent place to increase your skills, and one of my favourite riding spots ever.",
    "directions": "Turn east at the Husky station on Hwy 5 north of Kamloops.  Follow the signs to Paul Lake (watch out for the right turn when you're up the hill about 14km).\r\rThe trails end at the little parking lot by the lake.  The top of the trails is up a smaller dirt road off of the ski area.\r\rThe Kamloops Bike Riders Association has produced an excellent map to assist navigation, and there are corresponding signs for the map in the woods. NOTHING is named, so it's letters and numbers for reference.\r\r\r",
