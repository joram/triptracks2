    "description": "This is probably the Stewiacke valley's worst kept secret spot.  I've been going there fore years and was surprised no one had described it in trail peak.  The hike is a short one and suitable for all ages.  The hike goes through a small softwood mature stand and ends at a gorgeous two tier waterfall.  The upper fall is a true drop of about 30ft....which would probably make a good beginner ice climb.",
    "directions": "In Upper Stewiacke, take the Branch Rd south and turn left on Meadovale Rd.  turn on Higgins Mill Rd.  Cross the metal bridge and up the gravel road.  Park where you see some flagging tape on your right",
