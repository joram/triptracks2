    "description": "A very nice trail following a big stream (and crossing over several small streams) takes you past about 6 waterfalls of various sizes until, 4km from the parking lot, you get to the grand-daddy of the falls.  There is a wide falls of 20-30 feet but up a little further, a spectacular drop of a hundred feet (guessing here) through a narrow cleft in the surrounding rock.\nAn easy enough, well-marked trail, you can even catch supper in the pools along the way.  Plus, you get to walk in a place called Chattahoochee, how cool is that?  (Raven Cliff is located in the Chattahoochee National Forest).\nNice trees, nice people, nice views.  Do this trail.",
    "directions": "From Helen, GA, go to the north end of town and look for SR-75.  Turn South-West.  Drive about 3.7km to Secondary Road 385, turn NorthWest.  Drive about 4.5km NW up  #385 and turn into the park.",
