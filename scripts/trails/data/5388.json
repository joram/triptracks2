    "description": "These are forest roads that go deep into the forest. There are also interconnecting \"carty tracks\" and grass roads and singletrack throughout the system that are not included on this map. \r\rThe roads are open to vehicles in the fall but are very rough. The roads could probably be ridden on a hybrid but I would not do it. They are better suited to an MTB.\r\rMost of these roads are used as snowmobile trails in the winter.\r\rI mapped these over two days and had to overlap sections to do the mapping. The distance calculation does not include overlaps and the time is an approximation.",
    "directions": "Trail head I used is located on Kettles Road south of Richmond near western end of Munster Road. There is also access from Roger Stevens Drive and another unnamed road.",
