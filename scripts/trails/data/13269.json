    "description": "There is a nice waterfall of about 25ft at the end of an unnamed brook.  This brook is situated between Stewarts and White Brook on the Broad cove Banks Rd.  I set off from the hair pin turn at N46.19008\u00b0 W61.41073\u00b0 and followed the brook downstream.  There were a few 4-5ft fall along the way.  Just before you get to the coastline, you are getting out from the forest canopy.  The slopes of the ravine become steeper with some rock outcrops.The brook then plunges the last 25ft to the beach below.  I didn?t see any access point to the beach below near the fall but the locals might have a way downs somewhere else?that or a kayak trip would be spectacular!",
