    "description": "another exploration in my long lost search for MacNutt fall brought me to this brook.  I had seen a white spot on google earth and so was excited to get to it!   We started off on the lower reach and immediately got into a small but very cool ravine that has a couple of falls.  These weren't what I saw on the imagery so we continued upstream.   after a little while the forest change to a mature hardwood.  And then we spotted the bone remains of a moose.  nothing special you might say.  However, moose are only plentiful in cape Breton. they estimate the mainland population to be only about 300 individuals.Not much further up is a nice fall flowing on moss covered rock.  However due to the small watershed, the flow probably stops in the summer months.  Hiked more upstream but only found what looked like an old dam.BTW the search for MacNutt continues!",
