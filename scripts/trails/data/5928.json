    "description": "Twisty Trails with good views of Guelph lake. Mild climbing, trails are marked.\r\rParking at Riverside park and following the wide community trail north gives you a good warm up and on the way back take the single track that runs beside the Speed River. This is rocky technical trail. Once you cross Victoria road you can head to the dam or go right into the single track. This is a fun trail and not too difficult. It can get busy.",
    "directions": "You can park 1.5 km north of Woodlawn Rd and head right into the single track or park at Riverside Park and use the community trail to add some kms.",
