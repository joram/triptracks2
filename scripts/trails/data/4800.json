    "description": "The Seymour Demonstration Forest multi-use trail is part of the Lower Seymour Conservation Reserve, directly south of the Seymour Watershed.  The trail, for the most part, parallels the vehicle access road to the Seymour Dam, although it is rare that you actually see the access road itself.  The trail is wide, paved, and varies in elevation and direction.  It is well-used by cyclists, joggers, and inline skaters.  Picnic areas and pit toilets are scattered along the 11km (one-way) path at regular intervals.  Families and groups use this trail often.  Please keep the speeds reasonable and be aware of all users; fatal collisions have occurred on this trail in the past.",
    "directions": "The trailhead is difficult to reach by transit, though catching a bus to Capilano College and hoofing it from there is both picturesque and shady.  Using transit, the closest bus stop is a good 2-3km from the start of the multi-use trail.\nTraveling by car, head towards Capilano College and drive straight past the main gate to the campus.  Keep right on driving, past the riding stables and cemetery.  The road turns to gravel here, but just keep on chugging; you'll soon arrive at the trailhead, with ample free parking.\nFrom Hiway #1, take the Mount Seymour Parkway exit, then immediately go North on Lillooet Road for about 4.6 km.",
