    "description": "This is a hike I have done many times.  Rather than the typical lower hike around Thetis that most people do, you turn off at the first trail marker for the Lewis and Clark trail and head up to the highest peak in south end of the park then loop back around and up Seymour hill before going down and rounding the rest of the park.  I like the extra challenge of the hills on this route and it provides a bit extra distance to the Thetis loops.",
    "directions": "The GPS route I have included is from my house close to the park, but you can park in the main parking lot or the overflow lot on Atkins and keep to the right as you walk up to the lake.",
