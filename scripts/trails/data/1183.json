    "description": "A spectacular ride.  21.6km (don't laugh but it took us 5h30m in spite of a max speed of 51.4kmh).  It has everything, stick & stones, boulders & bears (well, probably), trickles & torrents, altitude & attitude.  Highly recommended.  (Look at those pictures!!).As you can see by the altitude plot, you probably want to do this CW, you can get the 500m climb over with with fresh legs and have 14km to recover & coast.  Interspersed on both sides is some fairly technical bouldering and lotsa mud.  Great cruises through the forest.  The big peak is at the \"MAP5051-11452\" waypoint.If you're pressed for time, there is a short ride by taking the purple path between the two other map waypoints (the track is a guess, didn't do it.Ed's note:  The Link is now on trailpeak, see \"Prairie Creek / Powderface Creek Link\" (trail # 6829)Busy day out here, we saw MTBs (40+), road bikes, hikers, kyakers, horse riders, dogs, and a dozen ricecycles including some guy who did a 600m wheelie down hiway 66.NTS Map: 082J15Elevation Gain: 500 m (1,640 ft).",
    "directions": "South Calgary, go west on Hiway 22x, keep going west after Bragg Creek.  Park at Beaver Lodge or Powderface lots, 17.2km W of the second Bragg Creek road.  Statr from the top of the Powderface lot.",
