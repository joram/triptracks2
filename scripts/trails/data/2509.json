    "description": "This is an all seasons trail in North Vancouver, BC. It is a moderate trail, with a low point of 65 m and a high point of 210 m, so nothing too difficult, although the climb west from the Seymour River along the Baden-Powell section of the trail is a bit steep.\r\n\r\nWe started at Lynn Canyon Suspension Bridge, crossed it and turned north, did a loop heading north parallel to Lynn Creek, eventually went east where we met the Seymour River, south to the Baden-Powell trail, and then back west to our starting point.\r\n\r\nThere is a number of geocaches along this trail (www.geocaching.com) although the tree cover occasionally blocks reception, remainders of old homesteads, bridges, waterfalls and lots of greenery.\r\n\r\nGenerally got GPS signal reception along most of the trail except along the BP trail, but that trail is so well marked, no worries.",
    "directions": "Take Lynn Valley Road in North Van north to Peters, turn right at the Lynn Canyon Suspension Bridge/Park sign. This park has washrooms, and a restaurant for a treat after the hike.",
