    "description": "This is one of those spots i kept looking at from a distance and wished i had time to explore.  The red head is aptly names as you can see those red cliffs from a great distance along the north shore of St Marys Bay.There is a small pull out area by the highway that leads you to the beach...from then on it is a matter of walking towards the cliffs up ahead.   The cliffs are quite brittle so no good for climbing.  after the first set of high cliffs, you will come up to a nice small waterfall with a small cave behind it.  This is where I turned around but you could walk along for a while more.",
