    "description": "A series of trails just across the river from downtown Midway, BC.  Climb up the hills and you can even see into the Good 'Ole USofA from some of the vistas.",
    "directions": "Find Florence Street and go South, crossing the bridge and turn to the right (West) on Fritz Road.  Trailhead (With Parking) is ~700m along that road and a second Trailhead another 500m further West.\nThe trails are suitable for all levels of hikers and mountain bikers. You could spend an hour or a couple of days to explore them all. There are a total of 12 km's of trail on the mountain and 2.1 km's along the Kettle River. The average grade of the mountain trails is approximately 12 % with a maximum grade of 25%. \nThe \"Riverwalk\" Trail is especially suited to the casual hiker or for cross country skiing as it is mostly level and meanders through the trees next to the Kettle River. Leave about one hour to do this trail and consider returning to the Village via the Trans Canada trail stopping at the Midway Station (Kettle River Museum) on your return trip.\nVisit the Trail's Website Midway Trails",
