    "description": "NTS Map: 082H04.This scramble is an extension of the Bertha Lakes Trail in Waterton national park. From the end of the official trail, cross the bridge to take the trail around the lake. After about 400m, you will come to a rise in the trail (which is basically flat), with open, rocky slopes to your right. Please also refer to  Bertha Lake trail on trailpeak, and Waterton Lakes National Park. This not the route described by Kane in his 'Scrambles in the Canadian Rockies'. Our route is further along the lakeshore and well past the two waterfalls.The rock here is fairly solid and makes for nice, easy scrambling. Keep moving left as you go upwards. At the top of this first section you will encounter small thick spruce trees. Make your way through these (through snow at end of June) to a small bowl. The second photo on the right below shows this bowl. The summit is up to your right. Straightforward climb to the top.On a clear day, which we had for about 15 minutes, the views are fantastic. The first photo on the left below, shows Bertha Lake and the large waterfall below it, as well as Waterton Lake behind Mt. Richards.Photo at top left is Bertha Lake from near the top of the first slope. Same for top right photo (this pose is not as dangerous as it looks. There is lots of solid ground just below my son. We would never put anyone in a position like that if it weren't safe. Some would, we won't. Besides, my wife said I had to bring him home in one piece).Total time is about 7 hours return and about 1,158 m (3,800 ft) elevation gain.",
