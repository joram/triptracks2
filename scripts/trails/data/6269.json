    "description": "Very steep trail that is relentless in the \"up 'department for first 3 kilometers, and then it is easier for the last 3 kilometers .Very well brushed and maintained. A small (4 person) cabin next to a lake (Bob Lake or Dunster Lake) in a open meadow setting. The cabin has 2 double beds, 4 summertime sleeping bags, and 2 inch foam to sleep on. There is a 2 burner camp stove and fuel, plenty of cooking pots and pans, some cutlery, and a few cups and plates. The lake is a very good source of very clean drinking and cooking water. The lake maintians its level from either rain water or snow melt from the past winters.",
    "directions": "Leave the Yellowhead Hwy. at the Dunster turn-off. Cross the single lane bridge across the Fraser River and continue to the 3 way stop sign. Turn left(east) and immediatly turn right on to the \"Pepper Pit road\". Follow this road for approx. 2 kms. and park at a gravel pit embankment adjacent to the trail head sign. The trail start\u00a0is 20 meters further up the road, and the elevation is 900m.\r\n\r\nThere is a wonderful viewpoint of the Dunster Valley at the 2km point in the hike, at an elevation of 1470m.\u00a0",
