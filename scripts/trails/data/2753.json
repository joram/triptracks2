    "description": "Elevation Gain: 627 m (2,059 ft); Max. El: 1,958 m (6424 ft)A pleasant offtrail hike in the Crowsnest Pass area.  As we neared a stream leading back to the municipal park we came accross a gate with a sign that said 'private property, no trespassing.' We soon we ducked off the road and followed a path along a small stream and came across a number of odd artworks that some individual obviously spent a lot of time constructing.  If interested in exploring Saskatoon Mtn (but not in trespassing accross the private property!) one could follow the first part of our loop and return by the same way, instead of following the last part of our loop.",
    "directions": "Exit Coleman just past the Rumrunner's bar and park at the municipal park. There are some paths that follow the stream that we followed initially before leaving the trail to ascend to Saskatoon Hill. Warning: lots of ATVs in the area and lots of ATV trails to get lost on...",
