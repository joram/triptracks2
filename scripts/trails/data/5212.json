    "description": "EZ Does It belongs to the Whistler Bike Park. It takes about 20 minutes to complete at an average speed. It is a green trail that is good for beginners although there are lots of rocks on the trail. It can be done on any kind of bike including a rigid bike but then it is a pain with all the rocks. Other than that it is a great trail to take.\r",
    "directions": "At the top of the Fitzsimmons trail take a right and keep going straight. Whistler has very good signage so it's hard to get lost.",
