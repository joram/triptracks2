    "description": "This hike is 15km, with an 800m elevation gain.  Nice views of the Rockies to the West, and the Pine Pass to the East.  The best way to get to the top is to follow the skid road 1.4 km along the power lines till you come to the cutblock on the right, then take a bearing on the fire lookout, and go through the cutblock and about 2km of forest, then another 1.5km through sub alpine scrub to the base of the mountain, then ascend the steep trail up to the fire lookout, and follow the ridge North to the summit.",
