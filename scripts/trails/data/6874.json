    "description": "Two choices here, you can freely ride up the hill and back down, or you can pay $US 16-20-25 (2010 price) to ride the chair up (1, 2 or unlimited times) and cruise down.  This is the main trail and there are several others that interconnect.\nIt is about 610 meters from the base to the summit over the 13km (one-way).  If you're riding, it will take a reasonably fit rider about 2 hours to go up the trail.  Uphill riders have the right-of-way, but watch for riders flying downhill.\nGREAT views of the area, lake, surrounding mountains from up top.  There is also a visitors center, gift shop, pub, (and maybe a nature center?) up top along with a small 'mad skilz' park with some skinny rails and minor stunts.\nYou can stay on the hill if you want, there are condos for rent up on the hill and especially in summer, there are lots to choose from.",
    "directions": "Whitefish Montanna, head North up East Lakeshore Drive to Big Mountain Drive (about 3-4km from the bridge over the tracks), then a further 8 twisty km (and 500m of elevation) to the top of the hill.  The trailhead is beside the Summit trail in the main lift area.  Note there is a hiking only trail there as well.",
