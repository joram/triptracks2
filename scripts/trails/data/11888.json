    "description": "Edwards Rating: I (I) S MThis is a good easy scramble with no technical challenge, very few exposure on the last portion and a very short scree slope before you get to the summit. Views are great even though it was not our favorite scramble overall. This is a very quick one to do when you have not much time and you want to workout since it offers good elevation gain, an obvious trail all along and it's not as crowded as some other peaks around like the \"too famous\" Baldy. It's definitely not as nice as Baldy though where you can do some hands on if you want, much more fun for sure.The trailhead is easy to find as you will see a little orange flag on the ground. You can also just hike in the dried-up creek bed staying on its left until a cairn and another flag show you the way up along that creek bed and in the forest. Stick to its left and you'll be fine. Elevation Gain 913 m3 to 5 hours",
    "directions": "From Calgary, follow Trans-Canada Hwy/AB-1 W to Kananaskis Trail/AB-40 S. Take exit 118 and start your odometer for a 23 km drive, such is just before the Kananaskis Village turnoff. Make a U-turn and park on the east side of the road, close to the dried-up creek bed.",
