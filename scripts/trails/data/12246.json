    "description": "The hike to Bedwell Lake is a rugged trail including everything from numerous bridge crossings, steep switchbacks, a multitude of wooden & steel stairs over steep rooted slopes & rocky bluffs, boardwalk over subalpine marshy sections and finally a couple of easy stream crossings at the shores of Bedwell Lake. From Bedwell Lake eastward to Cream Lake the route starts with more uphill, along a rough & sometimes muddy route, with increasing views of the mountains in the heart of Strathcona Park.",
    "directions": "From Campbell River, take Highway 28 West to the bridge over Upper Campbell Lake/Buttle Lake. Do not cross the bridge, but take the road down the East side of Buttle Lake. Follow Buttle Lake road south to Jim Mitchell Lake road. Follow this dirt road about 7 km to the trailhead.",
