    "description": "An alternative to the busy South Bear Creek loop, this trail heads south and follows Bear Creek over to Resources Rd just south of Wedgewood.",
    "directions": "From the South Bear Creek ball diamonds, take the paved that is on the south side of the diamond complex East approx. 200 m past the last diamond to a well used dirt trail that turns right and heads down to a foot bridge that crosses Bear Creek. Cross the bridge and follow the main trail up and to the right. At the top of the small climb turn left onto the start of this alternative route.",
