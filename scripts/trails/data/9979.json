    "description": "John Dean Park is a wonderful place for light hiking in old growth forest. I just did this little hike March, 2011 There are a variey of trails that can be taken and all are well maintined by a group of volunteers. There is very easy access from parking at the top of Dean Park Road. The one downside (if at all) is that the road into the park is closed in the winter which may restrict access. There is limited street parking near the gates of the park. For this hike I started by parkig at the end of Carmanah Terr.",
    "directions": "Head North from Victoria BC on the Pat Bay Highway.Turn off the Pat bay Highway West on Mount Newton Crossroad. Then head north on East Saanich onto Dean Park Road and follow it all the way to the top. This particular hike starts by parking at the far end of Carmanah Terr just off Dean Park Road before thee park gates. The hike takes about 90 minutes (5.4 km) and follows a trail that circles the park. Maximum elevation is 242 m with a total ascent of 232 m.",
