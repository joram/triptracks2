    "description": "Single pitch sport climbs overlooking Kamloops Lake. Quick access, good climbing.   Approximate Position, the cliffs near 10 U 660609 5626166",
    "directions": "Park at the Kamloops Lake Rest Area, 36 km West of Kamloops (East of Savona). If it looks tempting to take the trail to the right of the car park, don't do it (you'll end up with a 30 minute detour)...   take the well beaten path to the left of the car park (just behing the washrooms.) You can immediately look for bolts and rapel down or take the path to the bottom (probably just as easy). If rapelling, make sure you have enough rope - one section is 50m and the other is about 30m.",
