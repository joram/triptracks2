    "description": "The hike to Baker Lake has very little flat trail. The trail from Timberline Rd to Okanagan Mountain summit is a service road for the radio tower and from there the trail is fairly overgrown but still easy to navigate by tree markers. \nThis last portion isn't at all suitable for mountain biking but we did pass some great rock that would be suitable for some fun climbs.\n The hike up was pretty gruelling at a consistant uphill for 3 hours. From the Okanagan Mountain summit you descend for about 65 minutes down to the lake.  Baker Lake has one provincial style camping spot with an outhouse and firepit. It does not have a table or bear/food cache. (Divide Lake does).  In July 2011 some recent trail maintenance (brushing) was evident in a few spots so maybe they'll do the whole trail. On our trip in we saw plenty of wildlife including rattlesnakes, deer, and moose. Plenty of berries lined the trail.\nNote: Several of the included pictures are 360 panoramas so may appear deceiving as to distance and scope of terrain. The uploaded gps route was our decent so times will be much faster than the trip in. Total trip time includes rest stops, a swim, and meals. I would certainly recommend an overnight trip if possible.",
    "directions": "From Hwy 97 (Harvey) turn South on Pandosy; Right on Lakeshore (8.6 km); Left on Rimrock Rd (6.2km); Left on Rimrock again (426m); Right on Timberline (366m); Arrive at gated service rd. Aprox 30 min from downtown.",
