    "description": "NTS Map: 083C08A hike that, depending on the season, requires walking on the frozen stream or walking through the running one.  We did this trail in winter on snowshoes, but crossed the stream twice.  The best approach to the falls is also on the stream.  No fear in non-frozen months, the stream didn't look very treacherous at all.  The trail begins on an old road but soon turns into a path that gently goes upstream to the 5 foot high Tershishner Falls.  Nothing strenous, but a cool walk through the forest and along the stream.  Cool canyon at the falls.",
    "directions": "On highway 11, north of Abraham Lake, the highway crosses Tershishner Creek.  There is no bridge, but the road highway bends and the creek flows under it through large culverts.  Park your car just south of the stream on a gravel road on the west side of the highway.  Follow a narrow gravel road up-stream next right to the creek.  The road kinda begins in the ditch just north of where you parked.",
