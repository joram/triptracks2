    "description": "Sandy Lake is one of the lakes used by Nova Scotia Power for hydro power generation. The shoreline is uninhabited, and the lake provides a quiet, secluded wilderness paddle very close to the city. Give yourself time to explore the small beaches, and the island which separates Sandy and Rafter Lakes.",
    "directions": "Hwy 103 past exit 5 (Tantallon). In the valley immediately past exit 5, turn off the highway on the dirt road which leads to the Old Annapolis Road hiking trail (Bowater owns the land). You can either turn right, or continue straight on the dirt road, as there are put-in spots near the south end of the lake on either side. The put-in on the east side of the lake has a parking area and a boat launch.",
