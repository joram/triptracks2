    "description": "This is a great area to explore when you can't leave the city.  Rockingstone...i.e. the stone that you could rock.  Long time ago the huge erratic...I mean really huge...at least 20ft high.... could be rocked by a piece of wood wedged at it's base...some morons have messed around too much with it and now it is only a huge piece of erratic but it's not rocking anymore.Nevertheless, there are a lot of trails here....most of them look to be used by tav's so there is a lot of puddles so be warned ...my kids were in the rubber boots the whole way and it was necessary in most places.  The trail fluctuates between hard granite and mud puddles as the vegetation is dominated by labrador tea shrubs and tamarack trees.I will have to come back and explore fully with my mtn bike.  The erratic is close to the parking lot where there is a sandy beach on a lake.",
    "directions": "Old Sambro Rd (highway 306).  Turn on Rockingstone and continue until it becomes Feldspar crescent on your right and then turn left on Fieldstone rD and continue past the metal gate towards Kidston lake.  Park at the end of the rd and start walking towards the lake",
