    "description": "Destination:  DAWSON PASS & MT. HELEN (TWO MEDICINE /GLACIER) Elev. Gain: c. 2460 ft. to Dawson Pass, c. 3400 ft. to Mt. Helen  Distance: c. 14 ? 17 km. Class 1 to Dawson Pass, Class 2 to Mt. Helen  If you time it right, take the Sinopah boat (say at 10:30am) to the west end of Two Medicine Lake. From there it?s a hike on trail up c. 2460 ft. to Dawson Pass (7598 ft.)  From the pass the route is off trail, first along the ridge, then gaining another 1000 ft. to the summit of Mt. Helen (8538 ft.) Return the same way, hopefully catching the boat back to the starting point of the outing.  Make sure to know when the boat gets to the west end of the lake.  It takes about 15 minutes to cross the lake. If the boat is taken both ways, the total distance is 8.8 miles (c. 14 km.) Missing the boat one way adds 3 miles to the distance. Missing the boat both ways makes for a very long trip! The boat ride (works for there and back) is $12.25.",
    "directions": "Access Glacier Park at the Two medicine entrance and then simply drive to the parking lot with the boat dock.",
