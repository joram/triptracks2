    "description": "The North Road Trail, on the eastern side of Burnaby Mountain below Simon Fraser University, is one of the more moderate monuntain biking trails in the area, and a great trail to practice your riding skills in all seasons.\nThe North Road trail has a number of skinnies and ladders, rocky sections, steep ramps and small kickers, but all are optional.  It is a relatively flat trail, and can be done as an out and back, or can be linked up to a number of other trails on Burnaby Mountain to make a loop.\nThe trail has a number of sections.  Follow the trail most travelled.  Halfway along there is a very cool practice area, with log rides, some rampage and a small kicker.  Enjoy.",
    "directions": "Off Gagliardi way, turn into Broadway, then go let at North Road.  Shortly after the park lands start on your left, and up a steep hill, you will see a place to park your car on the left.   A notice board with a map can be found a short way down the main trail (Pipeline Trail).  North Road trail starts here on your right.",
