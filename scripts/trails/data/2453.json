    "description": "This is part of a bigger length of trails, see also:  the Trans Canada Trail - Boundary\r\n\r\nNice, *easy* abandoned rail ROW (Right Of Way) along some fabulously scenic mountain ledges, with a few old trestles, tunnels and buildings to make things interesting.  \r\n\r\nThis can be made as a shuttle if you have sufficient friends & cars or out & back.  I'd suggest starting from the Grand Forks end and riding up on the way out until you're dead, then you can coast back down to your vehicle.\r\n\r\nThere are two tunnels, both of which get quite dark in the middle due to their slight bends.  Very cool (figurtively & literally).\r\n\r\nThere is also a old railway building 10 km out that was refurbished as a shelter by TCT crews complete with chairs, tables and 4 bunk beds.  Bring yer sleeping bags.\r\n\r\nYou may be sharing the trail with bikes, motorcycles, quads and trucks (saw all in one afternoon), 9 out of 10 of the quad riders were very courteous about slowing down when passing us and we had a good chat with one group.",
    "directions": "Go West on Hiway 3 from downtown Grand Forks and look for Northfork Franklin Road on the right.  Turn right (North) and go 1.7 km where you will cross the rail bed.  There is parking space right there.  Start riding west.",
