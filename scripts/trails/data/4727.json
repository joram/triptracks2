    "description": "One of the biggest falls in Nanaimo, Ammonite is a nice day hike. The trail from Doumont has a few steep sections and a log bridge to cross. The section from the top to the bottom of the falls has a rope to assist hikers as it is steep and often wet and slippery. A GPS or guide is a good idea as there are a fair number of other trails that lead off the main one.",
    "directions": "The trail can be found by heading up Doumont Road off Metral Drive or Biggs Road off Jingle Pot Road. The trail head is the first pull off on the left after Doumont Road meets Biggs Road.",
