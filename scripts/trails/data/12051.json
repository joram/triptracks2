    "description": "This loop is a longer version of Favorite Run #1 that includes a trip up to the 1,427' high point of Annadel State Park. (Alas, there is no view from the high point...) This run starts with a flat 1.6-mile warm-up, followed by a nice shaded climb through a dense forest. The climb intensifies as it then follows a rocky singletrack through a redwood grove up to the high point of the park. This is followed by three miles along a great rolling singletrack that slowly descends to Lake Ilsanjo. After a trip around Lake Ilsanjo, the route then follows the technical and rocky Rough-Go Trail and Cobblestone Trail, and ends with a mile descent back to your car.",
    "directions": "Just drive along the Channel Drive to find a parking spot. Walk to the trailhead.",
