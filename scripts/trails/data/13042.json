    "description": "An easy hike into the badlands near the Red Deer river north of Drumheller, Alberta.  The hike starts from the Horse Thief Canyon lookout just off Hwy 838.  The trail descends about 100 meters into the valley and just extends down the valley and back.  Only do this when the ground is dry and there is no threat of rain as the ground gets very slippery when wet.",
    "directions": "From downtown Drumheller, drive north on Hwy 9 across the Red Deer river until you reach Hwy 838 junction.  Take Hwy 838 west and north until you reach the Horse Thief Canyon turnoff.  (watch for the sign)",
