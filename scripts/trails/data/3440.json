    "description": "A pleasant urban trek along the banks of the Bow River.  It does involve some up and down as the path follows the riverbank and in winter, ice cleats of some sort are recommended.  You can go in and out on the same trail, back along the river or cross the river on a pedestrian bridge at each end.One night while walking through there we saw the hugest owl, he seems to frequent the area but does seem to hide if he sees anyone with a camera.Start in the large parking lot in Edworthy Park, about 7km West of downtown and look for the trailhead in the ESE corner of the parking lot.",
    "directions": "The entrance to Edworthy park is at the NE corner of  Sarcee and Bow Trails in Calgary (enter from Bow Trail West bound).  Take the steep, narrow road down into the park and watch for walkers and cyclists on the way.  From the Edworthy parking lot follow the asphalt pathway towards downtown.  This part of the trail is beside the train tracks. The trail head is along this path by a couple hundred meters and is very well marked and well used.",
