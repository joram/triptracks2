    "description": "This is the hike to the bottom of the awesome fall called Devil?s Punchbowl near Hamilton.   The fall has created a perfect circular bowl with the fall at its apex.  There is no set trail so my description is the unofficial way to get to the bottom of the fall.  From the parking lot, aim for the viewpoint with the cross.  Look at the view and then look to the right for a faint trail that descends very steeply to the bottom of the ravine.  Make your way very carefully to the side of the stream and then up to the main waterfall.  The limestone has multiple colors which is very spectacular when seen from the bottom.  I choose another way up which seems to be another way to access the falls although it?s hard to say with the snow on the ground.  All in all if you follow the gps track it?s a difficult hike but I am sure you can take the long way around and make it into a moderate type hike.",
