    "description": "Rated strenuous by the East Coast Trail Association. Total trail is about 15 km in length. My gpx file picks up the trail near Little Herring Cove Pond near Marine Park. Be prepared for long stretches of trail that are exposed to the elements at high elevation.    Slippery, muddy conditions after rainfall. Multiple elevation changes over 100 meters. Carry 1st aid and be prepared for emergencies as there are no bail out points. exercise caution near steep cliffs.",
