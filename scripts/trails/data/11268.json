    "description": "This is a description of a great hike to a large waterfall in an area where you did not expect anything.  I wasn?t exactly sure where the fall was located on the stream so my gpx track starts too much upstream as I make my way downstream to eventually find the large fall.  At first it is nice and cool in the ravine of the brook.  A carpet of moss everywhere, some small waterfalls or cascades and an easy walk.  I was getting worried that this stream did not have the fall I was expecting.That is until I rounded one last bend and was faced with the two sharp drop offs of the waterfalls.  What is unique about this place is that the opposite wall of the fall is a huge scree slope topped with a large rocky outcrop making the whole thing look like a natural amphitheatre.  The first drop of the fall is about 10 ft and at its base is a large pool.  The pool narrows to about 3ft across and right there is a rope to take you in or out of this place if you did not reach it via the stream like I described above.  Below the first drop is the second drop of about 25 ft.  The water at the time of my visit was low so there were three distinct small falls to see instead of a very large looking waterfall.  Although it was still very scenic with one part of the fall looking like a sluice.  I followed the stream  a little bit more downstream and spotted a rope to get back to the top of the rim looking over the waterfalls.",
