    "description": "This trail is a set of three that thread themselves through a department of forestry Experimental woodlot area. Despite the overkill on the interpretive signage, the trails pass through several interesting areas, and mixed terrain. It's a great half day hike or snowshoe come winter.\nThe trail names are as follows:\nGaudet Trail\nFlood Trail\nExtraction trail.\nThe lengths range from 1KM to probably around 2K's Totaling approximately 5K in the entire loop.\nGreat beginner's mtn bike area for sure.",
    "directions": "On the road to the Brookvale Provincial Ski park, look for the signage on the opposite side of the road; Brookvale Experimental Forest Trail.\nTake the dirt road that runs 0.8K to the parking area. In winter, hike the road and add a bit extra to the length.",
