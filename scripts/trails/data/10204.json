    "description": "Glenbow Ranch is Alberta's newest provincial park and was officially opened August 9, 2011 by Premier Ed Stelmach. The land was acquired from the Harvie family and is in part still a working ranch.\nThere are a number of trails, some paved some not paved. Some are designated no bikes.\nThe GPS data attached has both our first walk partly on the paved bike path and partly a designated walking trail only and also our second ride around the area.",
    "directions": "Take Highway 1A (Crowchild trail) west from Calgary to Glenbow road, heading west it's a right turn. The intersection is not well marked at this time there is no sign. It's opposite range road 35 (heading north). Follow Glenbow road to the parking lot.",
