    "description": "A gentle multi-use trail that starts near downtown Courtenay and leads out of town towards Wildwood Interpretive Forest and beyond. The trail is the former railway grade of the Comox Logging & Railway Company, so is very gentle. The trail takes you through farmland and some forest areas.More information, including maps available here: http://www.comoxvalleyrd.ca/EN/main/community/parks-trails/comox-valley-parks/one-spot-trail.html",
    "directions": "Various road crossings to access the trail, parking available at Brazier Road, at the entrance to Wildwood Interpretive Forest.",
