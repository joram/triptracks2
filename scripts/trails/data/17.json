    "description": "NTS Map: 092H02 \r\nManning Park is very popular with cross-country skiers (and snowshoers) in part because of its proximity to Vancouver (3 hours) and in part because they get a lot of snow.  There are cabins that can be booked, and, there are plenty of trails, mostly in a long chain of trails, roughly 30km worth.  \r\n\r\nThe friendly staff will be glad to assist you either with rentals, waxing, or directions.  Manning also has a downhill ski area so it makes for a nice combination if you stay in the area for the weekend.  \r\n\r\nThe info line at Manning is 250-840-8822.  Day trips are run from Sigge's cross-country ski shop in Vancouver, which includes bus transportation and day pass.  Contact  Sigge's for more information.\r\n\r\nGet directions and more information here: \r\n http://www.manningpark.com/\n\r\nThe Provincial site is here:  www.env.gov.bc.ca/bcparks/explore/parkpgs/manning.html",
