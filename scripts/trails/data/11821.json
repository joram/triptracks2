    "description": "This is a short hike to a beautiful multi tier 12ft waterfall.  This area downs't offer many hiking opportunities...this is one of them.  The brook is not the sissiboo river but it's unnamed in my 1:50 000 topo map.  The hike is up a densely forested evergreen forest ravine.  After just a short effort, you will be rewarded with the waterfall",
    "directions": "In Weymouth, take the Weymouth falls rd a nd turn left on Gates Lane.  Park at the bottom of the hill before crossing the bridge at the 90 degree bend in the orad...the brook is to the left of the road...walk upstream",
