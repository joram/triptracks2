    "description": "A 2 km loop yields excellent views of two beaver ponds while the guide provides an introduction to Algonquin's fascinating beaver ecology.\r\n\r\nLots of exposed rock ridges in the area (rock barrens) you could easily explore the area with topo map and GPS, moving from ridge to ridge (when it's not prime black fly season).\r\n\r\nAlgonquin park is a very large Ontario park which is partially preserved (logging is allowed in places), and there are several other Algonquin hikes on Trailpeak for Algonquin, you can easily make this a hike destination as well as the better known paddle routes and camping.",
