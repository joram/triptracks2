    "description": "A paved path all the way around the Miramar Reservoir. This can be a busy place on weekends. \nThis is a wide trail. A lot of signs reminding people to keep to the far right, and to pass on the left. Occasionally, cars or trucks also use the trail, to get to the good fishing spots. The speed limit is 15 mph. On a  pleasant spring Sunday, there was a high percentage of the California \nrunner/jogger/walker/biker/blader population getting their exercise, so the trucks had to be really careful.\nAt the western end of the reservoir is the dam. Apparently, for a few years after 9-11, no one was permitted to cross over the dam. This would have been a real drag, because it is really nice to do a loop. Even now, there are big security fences (chain link with barbed wire on top) protecting the dam - we had to walk between two such fences for a short distance.",
    "directions": "From Interstate 15, take the Mira Mesa Boulevard east, turn right on Scripps Ranch Boulevard, then left on Scripps Lake Drive. The reservoir entrance will be on your left",
