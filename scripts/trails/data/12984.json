    "description": "This is a hike to a well known fall on the Folly River. I had been here before but forgot to post it on trailpeak. The gpx track lead way more upstream than needed as I was exploring for more falls. I did find a scenic spot where the river splits into two branches with a rocky island in the middle. there is a 12 ft fall too! (N45\u00b0 30.320' W63\u00b0 31.772'). About 600m further downstream is the major 40ft fall. There is a nice open area in an evergreen stand right at the top. You can do a careful down climb just a bit further downstream but it is very precarious...especially when the slopes are still encased in ice! The gpx track in the film will lead you further downstream to an area with lots of drops but no major falls and then it finally gets to the folly river lowest waterfall at the furthest point downstream.",
    "directions": "Highway 4 towards Wentworth. Park anywhere after the railroad crossing and follow the gpx track to the falls at; N45\u00b0 29.952' W63\u00b0 31.751' and N45\u00b0 29.563' W63\u00b0 31.567'",
