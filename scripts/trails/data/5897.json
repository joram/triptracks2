    "description": "First mile of the trail is easy. After that it becomes more difficult and rocky including some rather large steps. I found it difficult to maintain a reasonable pace.It winds along the hillside over a ridge to the pools. You can continue up the canyon past the pools but most people stop at the pools. Diving into the pools is possible I heard a significant splash while at the pools. This a relatively popular trail.As with all desert hikes bring water, 4 litres is the suggested amount. Beware of long skinny creatures.For guided hiking and biking trips in Arizona, check out aoa-adventures.com.",
    "directions": "From Tucson follow Oracle Road north to Catalina park. Drive to parking lot at very end of paved road. You will find a sign for the trail head.",
