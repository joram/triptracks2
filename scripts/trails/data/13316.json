    "description": "This is a hike to some waterfalls located close to the green hill falls near Ashdale.  These are not the biggest fall around but the first ravine is actually pretty deep for the size of the brook.  The journey is of a bushwhack nature and you will visait two falls on two tributaries of the Herbert River.   The terrain looked promising on the topo map but the geology failed to create very large or tall falls.",
    "directions": "Highway 202 (South Rawdon Rd) to the bridge over the Herbert River at; 45\u00b001'31.9\"N 63\u00b051'06.3\"W.  Follow the river upstream to the two tributaries located on the south side of the river.",
