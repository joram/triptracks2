    "description": "Another roadside fall.  North of Antigonish, McAdam brook loses all its elevation at once creating a beautiful multi step fall that's only a few meters from the highway.   You probably won't notice it unless you are looking for it.  the terrain to get to it is a bit steep but in a few minutes you will stand at the foot of the fall.",
    "directions": "Highway 245 to close to Arisaig.  The fall is approx at;  45\u00b044'27.06\"N,  62\u00b011'36.42\"W",
