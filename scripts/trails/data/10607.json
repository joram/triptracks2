    "description": "This trail is in the Highlands National park. The journey begins from the Cheticamp campground and runs mainly along the Cheticamp river and has three main pools of deep water where the salmon going up stream could rest and feed, also there are a few small falls and an extreme amount of forest and mountain scenery.",
    "directions": "Enter the Cheticamp campground and follow it straight through and back under the Cabot trail to the second part of the campground you will come to a T in the road turn to the left follow to the end and turn right the trail start will be on your right hand side. The trail is well defined for about the first four km in and can be mountain biked this will take you in to the first and second pools, after that the trail gets tighter with a few small ups and downs not many people venture the third pool and for that reason made it the one I like the most.",
