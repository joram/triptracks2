    "description": "This is the staightforward route to the falls and back the same way. This trail was surprisingly rough in some places with several downed trees blocking the way. It was winter when I did this hike after a period of heavy rains and in many places a stream was running along the trail and it was quite muddy. There are several stream crossings that I imagine are easier to negotiate in drier conditions, having said that however there should be nothing to trouble an average hiker.The big cedar tree along the route is magnificent and the falls were in full flood, very impressive indeed. The gully leading to the falls and the area around it are a bit of a mess with slipping slopes and debris from old logging activity much in evidence.A very enjoyable hike though once you get past all the bikes.",
    "directions": "Heading towards North Vancouver on Highway 1 take the Mountain Highway exit 21, drive all the way up to the top crossing Lynn Valley Road as you go. Keep going straight up past the last residential street, (Borthwick) and Mountain Highway becomes a dirt road, ignore the no access sign and keep going a short distance until you see a parking area on the right.",
