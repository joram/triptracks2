    "description": "NTS Map: 092G01Matsqui trail is a long and flat trail. It's a perfect low level walk that is snow free. It is also part of the Trans-Canada Trail. It follows dykes along the Fraser River directly across from Mission.\r\n\r\nIts features include a river walk, view of ships, and, wheel-chair access.  \r\n\r\nThe park is open during the days, and is a nice alternative for those looking for a little variety in their river walk/run routine.\r\n\r\nIf you just want a couple of hours to get out, this is the perfect excursion.\r\n\r",
