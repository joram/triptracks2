    "description": "A nice expedition with open water stretches and protected water as well. Watch for the seals along the way!\r\rThe first portion is protected waters with thousands of islands. Then you go open water with waves up to 4-5 feet to Litle Duck Island. Then from that island you head to the Indian Island. Nice spot for lunch. You can stop behind the first island in a protected area where the water is calm and you can walk in the water. 3 feet of water only.\r\rFrom that island you head back to the trail head in Blue Rocks, NS.\r\rAwesome day. Make sure you carry enough equipment for the day. There is nothing on the way! Bring a marine radio if possible in case of emergency. You're far from the coast but can reach help if required... The fog is really bad and come in very quickly. Make sure you carry your GPS with the route and a paper chart.\r\rHave fun!",
    "directions": "About 45 min from Halifax, you'll find the small village of Blue Rocks. Once you get in the village, turn right on The Lane. at the end of that road, make a left on The Point Road. You'll see the ramp on your right. You can't miss it!",
