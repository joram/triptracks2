    "description": "NTS Map:92B6.  Built in the 1890s as part of a system of coastal defences, Fort Rodd Hill and nearby Fisgard Lighthouse occupies 45 acres of Garry Oak forests with walking trails throughout the historic fort. Signs, audio and video programs and interpretive staff make this a wonderful way to spend a couple of hours exploring. Special events in the summer are the highlight of any visit.",
