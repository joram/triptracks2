    "description": "The trail is traditional Sedona redrock with sections of slick rock, single track, and nice drops. The first part of the trail is a climb up to highline which has some steep exposure, so if you don't like heights, you might be walking a bit until you get out into the meat of the ride. For bike rentals: We rented in Scottsdale (near Phoenix) at AOA-adventures for great weekly rates on GIANT and Specialized, allowing you to ride McDowell Preserve or South Mountain in Phoenix  before heading to Sedona.",
    "directions": "The ride started at the well known Bike & Bean, just off Hwy 179, in the Village of Oak Creek. From the Bike & Bean head north along the road for a block or two until you see the trail begin on the left.",
