    "description": "This is a pleasant hike up the mountain to the top of the ski hill.  There are several ways to go, depending on how steep you would like to go.  Because this is a downhill ski area the trail is continuously climbing.  When snow shoeing, keep an eye out for skiers and boarders!\r\n\r\nWhen you get to the top, the view of the Lions and Howe Sound is spectacular! There is GPS data attached to this trail (see \"download GPS\"), which if loaded into your GPS can help you find route points.",
    "directions": "Start at the parking lot at Cypress Bowl.  If you have a GPS, use the attached track-log file. Put your GPS in track-back mode.  When in track-back mode (very simple) your GPS will create a set of way-points and lead you through each turn in the route.\r\n\r\n\r\nsome cool footage launching from Strachan\r\n\r\n \r\n\r",
