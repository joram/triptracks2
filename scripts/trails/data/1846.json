    "description": "NTS Maps: 082O05Elevation Gain: 436 m (1,430 ft).This is a short, steep path that climbs to a tremendous viewing area. From the lookout, which is still far below the crest of the imposing Castle Mountain, the Bow Valley extends in both directions in almost limitless majesty.\r\nYou will work to ejoy this view, climbing more than 530m in just 3.7-km, but few have ever complained after experiencing the panorama they are rewarded with at the lookout.\r\n\r\nThe return trip, it hardly needs to be mentioned, is all downhill and a much faster walk than the ascent.\r\n\r\nIn winter please check the Avaluator\r\n(Online Trip Planner) rating is: \r\n Complex.  \r\nSee more trip planner route details here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r",
