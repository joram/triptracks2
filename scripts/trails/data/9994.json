    "description": "There is a mixture of terrains here: sage scrub, chaparral, and oak woodland. \nThere are some amazing views of the valley with its ranch. The ranch dates to the 1930s. Martha's grove is named for a ranger who died rather young.\nTrails are also used by equestrians. Note the signs at start indicate some trails are one way only.\nThe trail is quite popular with mountain bikers. The first part of the trail is  one-way, mainly going downhill on a really rough trail. We saw 5 bikers in the 2.5 hours that we were there .\nhttp://www.sdcounty.ca.gov/parks/openspace/Sycamore_Goodan.html",
