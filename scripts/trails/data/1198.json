    "description": "Good newly made trail goes up next to a beautiful waterfall before crossing the creek on a log bridge.You then follow an old cut road until turning off into the woods and assending steeply through old growth forest.This trail is a bit wet in places,but would be spectacular when the larches turn in early fall.The elevation gain is about 600 meters and it takes about two and a half horus to reach the top meadow area.There is a stream that you follow most of the way up.\r\n          The ridge walks up here are spectacular and there is also a small lake where you see many and varied tracks of animals in the soft edges.The view  is of the Septet range.There is also a linked trail that goes over to Septet Pass and down to the road behind if you can manage a car shuffle.",
    "directions": "Follow directions for Bugaboo Lodge and Kain Hut until the turnoff into the CMH Lodge.Take the left fork here,and about 700M past the turn take another left across the bridge.Ignor the left turnright after the bridge and follow the somewhat overgrown road up to the trailhead parking lot,approximately three km.Be sure to use the provided chicken wire to protect your vehicle,and a high clearence vehicle would be best for the last part of the acess road.",
