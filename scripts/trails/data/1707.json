    "description": "Lots of hills, pretty tiring this one. There are four trails, a main 2km loop, then a 2.5 km, to a 5, to a 7km loop for the biggest one of all. But the beauty is the small single track trails that join the main double wide trails together. Be prepared to spend all day out there to really get a good grasp of everything the hills have to offer.There are also hiking and snowshoeing trails on the North Escarpment, along the fire road and between many of the ski trails.",
    "directions": "Go to Brandon, take 18th street or #10 highway south about 3 miles till you hit an antique shop, take a left and drive or bike for about a mile. The turnoff is clearly marked. Enjoy. Bring lots of water.Trailhead at N49 43.437 W99 54.669",
