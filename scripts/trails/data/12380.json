    "description": "A short hike on ATV and snowmobile trails leads you to a 40 ft waterfall for this trail entry.   I wasn't sure exactly where this fall could be and I ended up going way too far into the woods that I needed to go.   So you lucky readers don't have to waste the time I did.  Basically the trail starts at a small bridge over the Factory Brook that looks a bit dangerous to try to cross by car.  Follow this wide road on a gentle uphill until it enters a large clearing.  A trail/road to the right is what you are looking for.  It immediately starts to go up a good hill and it is carved from the slope itself.After a while you emerge at a flat spot and to a recently logged area.  the track you see led me to follow two different branches of the brook to hat i thought would be waterfalls.  There was one on the right hand side that was about 10ft but nothing spectacular.  The branch o the left actually was dry when I was there in June.So feeling dejected, I retraced my steps only to find the 40ft fall right off the path/road......The fall is in a ravine that has some slash from the logging at the top.  Once you pass it, the rest of the way is steep but clear.",
