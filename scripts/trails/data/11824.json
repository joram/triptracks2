    "description": "An alternative to starting at the cross country ski area, this is a shorter loop from the parking lot near the downhill ski area. You start on the Baden Powell trail which will fork at approximately 0.8km, stay to the left towards Hollyburn peak.Once you've reached the peak, and enjoyed the view, keep heading along the Hollyburn trail til you reach the Baden Powell once again at approximately 4.6km. Keep to the right this time and you will return to the trail head. If you don't go right you'll end up at the cross country ski area.",
    "directions": "From Vancouver head west on BC-1 W.Take exit 8 for Cypress Bowl Road toward Ski Area.Merge onto Cypress Bowl RdLook for the first aid building on the right. The Baden Powell trail head is in that area.",
