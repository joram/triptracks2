    "description": "This trail starts at the Wahkeena Falls Trailhead and we hiked counterclockwise around the loop, starting going SW and following the very good signage on the route. Hiking up towards the Lemmen Viewpoint entails about 12 switchbacks on paved path. After this point the trail is very good dirt path. After this point you would cross two bridges and past by several waterfalls, including Lower & Upper Wahkeena Falls & Multinomah Falls, which are the highlight of the hike.",
    "directions": "Most Direct 30 Minute: From Portland take I-84 eastbound for approximately 30 miles. Follow signs and take exit 31 (an unusual left-side exit ramp) off I-84 to a parking area. Follow the path under the highway to reach the falls viewing area.Scenic, 45 minutes:From Portland take I-84 to exit 28 (Bridal Veil exit) and drive three miles east on the Columbia River Gorge Scenic Highway.
