    "description": "Elevation Gain: 365 m (1,200 ft)\r\nOne of the most popular trails in Glacier National Park (Montana), Iceberg Lake has icebergs (fallen from the adjacent 3000' cirque walls) well into August and sometimes beyond. The trail runs along the generally open Wilbur Creek valley. Although open and hot, there are plenty of little waterfalls along the trail, so bring along your filter. The grade is only 365 m over 7 kms (1200' over 4.5 miles), so this is a popular trail in summer. Distance and time shown are round trip.\r\nThe photo above left is not on the trail but is about 5 kms (3 miles) east, on the road in to the trailhead.",
    "directions": "Trailhead (well signed) is behind the Swiftcurrent Motor Inn at the Many Glacier section of Glacier N.P.",
