    "description": "This challenging walking trail, 5 km in length, traverses a wide variety of ecosystems. In winter, there are 5 and 8 km groomed trails for x-coutnry skiing.Most striking is the abundance of local wild life, particularly beavers. Testimony to the busy lives of the local animals is a giant beaver dam some six feet high.The trail crosses the original railway bed that was built through the Sudbury area at the turn of the last century.It was while this railway was being built that valuable nickel and copper mineral deposists were dicovered that have made Greater Sudbury \"geologically\" famous.",
    "directions": "Take highway 144 north of Sudbury to Azilda. Turn right on Gagnon Street (first street in Azilda) to the end of the street.",
