    "description": "We ended up doing this short an very easy trail while we were looking for a geocache.  We followed some old road towards the dam, just to log an extra km.  A good stretch to do for a break from driving.  There is a free telescope on the viewing platform to check out Marsh Lake.  There are signs that talk about regional flora and fauna and history.  Also, there are views and trails to a small hydro electric dam on the Yukon River.",
    "directions": "The Trail head is the parking lot at the Blue Bridge on the Alaska Highway, about 30 km SE of Whitehorse.  You can't miss the trailhead once in the parking-lot, and the blue bridge is also impossible to miss if driving south out of Whitehorse.",
