    "description": "This lovely trail will take you up to Crabapple Lake, a secluded lake deep within the Sea to Sea Green Belt Park Reserve. Many years ago there was a cabin up here along with a paved road at some point in time. The paving is long gone but the route to the lake is very obvious. Just follow the main road for 10km until you get to the lake. When you see a giant tree and I mean GIANT, you know you are close. Enjoy the hike!",
    "directions": "Head west along the Sooke Highway (Rte. 14) and turn right just after the fire hall on Harbourview Road. Continue right to the end where there is a very obvious CRD parking lot.",
