    "description": "NTS Map: 082J07Pickle Jar Lakes, there are four paternoster lakes the first offers good fishing. There were an number of campers and people fishing.You don't access these lakes from Pickle Jar Creek, but rather Lantern Creek. Follow trail until it reaches a fork on the ridge about 500 meters from the first lake. You have choice of going higher over rocks and scree or down to Pickle Jar Creek and up along the creek. At this time I'd recommend the high route as there has been a significant blow down along Pickle Jar Creek.",
    "directions": "Highway 40 at Lantern Creek day use area. Trail starts on opposite (east) side of highway slightly north of day use area.",
