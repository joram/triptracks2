    "description": "From http://www.valemount.com/trailsandattractions/skihill%20mountain.htm\r\r3 km trail with an extreme elevation gain of 1500' (450 meters) to the first lake. Very good alpine hiking as well as a beautiful view of Mount Robson and the surrounding mountain ranges. \r\r\rThe first segment of GPS trail is to the first lake, the second trail segment is to the second set of lakes in the upper basin just below the peak.  Keep an eye out for mountain goats.\r\rApproximately 2/3 of the lower trail has been brushed and cleared in 2009.",
    "directions": "From Valemount drive South on highway 5 taking the first road to the right past the Holiday Inn (opposite the turnoff to Kinbasket Lake). Just after leaving the highway stay to the left, drive for approximately 2 km along the power lines and then take the right hand fork which leads to the Westridge Forest Service Road (FSR). Watch for the trailhead sign at 14.5 km on the Westridge FSR.",
