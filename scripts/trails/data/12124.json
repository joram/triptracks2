    "description": "This hike actually begins as a paddle.  You can try to bushwhack about 2km from a bridge located south on highway 357 or paddle for ten minutes!The paddle soon leaves the main Musquodoboit River and enters a really cool meandering marsh.  The tall grass towers a bit above the boat but its easy to navigate to the outfall of the stream.  This stream is where all the falls are located.  The bulk of the falls are located at the start and end of the stream so do hike through the forest to the stream beginning at Gibraltar Lake.  You wont be disappointed by the forest either.  The towering hemlock leave a deep moss carpet that is just so lush and beautiful.",
