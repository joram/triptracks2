    "description": "The Mount Macfarlane trail makes its way to lower Pierce Lake along a fantastic (but relentlessly steep) trail. Climbing almost 3500 ft to the lake, it is a most welcome sight while under the weight of an overnight pack. We camped at this beautiful emerald green 100 ft deep Lake, and took a resident canoe out for a spin. In the morning we set out for Upper Pierce Lake and Mt. Macfarlane.  This is where the scenery really opens up. Breathtaking!",
    "directions": "From Highway 1, take the \"119 Sardis\" exit, turn left at the Chilliwack Lake sign (4-way stop at the bridge), and drive about 22 km to a turn off on the right.  A good gravel road takes you to a gate and sign. The trailhead is about 2 and a half switchbacks up the gated road.",
