    "description": "Nice short 5 km hiking/biking trail. For hikers its a light workout. For cyclists, it has plenty of challenges to keep you off your seat.",
    "directions": "Drive up to the look out overlooking the valley, then walk up to the the top of the hill. From the top of the stairs, go South East a few hundred steps and you'll see the trailhead there.",
