    "description": "This isn't actually a single trip but a composite of many day hikes that myself and others have taken.  I took the GPS tracks from all of these hikes and put them together to represent most of the known trails on the north side of Mt Benson.  There may be a few other trails out there but I think this represents most of them.  If you know of others and have GPS tracks for them I'd love to get a copy of the gpx file and I'll add them to this summary.  Most of the trails in this summary are easy to moderate difficulty.  In Spring, Summer and Fall, the trails are great for hiking and mountain biking.  In winter there is some excellent snowshoeing to be had.",
    "directions": "Take Jingle Pot Rd to Kilpatrick Rd, turn right on Jameson Rd then left on Northwood and right on Longview.  Park at the end of Longview and start hiking at the yellow logging gate.",
