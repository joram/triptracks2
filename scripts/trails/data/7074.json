    "description": "This is a well worn trail and easy to follow with old Comox District.  Mountaineering Club signs at some of the intersections. The trail has some fairly steep sections after Drabble Lakes and provides great vies from the summit.",
    "directions": "Drive from Courtenay along Condensory Road, Piercy Road and then left on Plateau Road and continue up to the base of the old Forbidden Plateau Ski Hill.\nFrom there you have to climb part of the old ski hill and then into Strathcona Park. The start of the trail is on the main trail to Mount Beecher until you find the junction signed for Kwai and McKenzie Lakes.",
