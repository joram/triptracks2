    "description": "NTS Map: 082O03Elevation Gain: 900 m (2,953 ft).A Bow Vally Classic for hikers and climbers.  Its sheer 500' face can be seen from the TransCanada and the peak is often in the clouds.  It gets an A for accessability.There are many routes for both up this limestone mountain to the 2240m summit.  Even hikers (who can do a 900m elevation change in 4.5-6km) can make it to the summit without special equipment.  The first 3km is through mixed forest with a wide variety of wild life and birds to see.  Above the trees is a fair amount of skree and careful footing is required.A loop can be made around the mountain and if so, do it CCW.  To make the loop (or get to the summit from the E), there is a narrow ledge 30m long that must be traversed about 300m from the summit.  There is a cable to hang on to but it isn't for the faint of heart as you can see in the picture.Editor's Note: This is a scramble. Be aware that scrambling can injure or kill you. Be prepared, know your limits and make sure somebody knows where you're going.",
