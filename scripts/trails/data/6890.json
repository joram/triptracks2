    "description": "In 2009, the Gairloch trail was constructed with support funds provided to Island Trails. As an attempt to develop trails in regions other than the ones centrally located, this one was designed with a bent to Mountain Biking.\nMostly single track, the course contains a few wide bridges to cross over creeks. One section comes out onto a log road for a spell before returning back to mixed forest.\nThe course is well marked, though the maps lack proper orientation, and thus can be misleading.\nThere are sections of the path that are very roller coaster in design. With trench like terrain, at times, the path will meander up and down both sides simply for the thrill of it. Hikers hate this illogical path design, but mtn bikers can' get enough.\nAs of 2010, the surface of the trail needs more tread wear. With lots of spongy mossy sections, it's a slow go on a mountain bike, but a soft foot fall for hikers.\nShannon Burt\neast coast editor",
    "directions": "From Charlottetown, take the TCH (route 1) to Eldon, near Lord Selkirk Provincial Park, and turn onto Garfield Road, or route 207. Turn left at route 204, or the Gairloch Road, and look for the trailhead on your left, a little more than 1K up the road.",
