    "description": "Loop route that leaves Westwood Lake parking lot heading to the southeast, climbs across the power line up onto Westwood Ridge, then returns down Westwood Creek creekbed to the power line and northwest end of Westwood Lake to bring you back to the starting point.I took my 75 year old father out on this trail, intending to follow 3306 (\"Mt. Benson from Westwood Lake, the long way\") but found that is was not as well marked or maintained as we expected.  In order to keep within limits of our time and endurance, we turned back at approximately the halfway point of 3306, and decided to explore a bit on our way back down. The creekbed was a much more forgiving descent than the steep way in would have been if we had simply retraced our steps.The route is about 12km as recorded on the GPS, but if you don't explore it will be less. To shorten the route about 2.5km, don't cross the bridge after coming down off of Westwood Ridge. You will still have seen most of the good vistas this hike offers up. You will cut another 1.5km off the route if you go left on the powerline when you return to it on the way down, rather than following our path of temptation to graze on blackberries. :-)",
    "directions": "Park in the lot at Westwood Lake Park, then head south on the park trail.",
