    "description": "The Nanaimo area has three major mountain bike and downhill areas, each with over 30 trails in their respective networks.  Simple arithmetic tells us this equals major fun, and a good 3 or 4 day road trip to sample the area.  Once finished up with Nanaimo, head up to Comox/Courtenay area and then Hornby Island for some more awesome mountain biking, island style.\r\nBut let's not digress.  On this sample map, kindly provided by Pacific Rim Bicycle (250-390-2077) in Nanaimo, you'll see a high-lighted area in green that represents some of the tougher single track in the Malaspina woodlot network of trails.  Note that some of this land is private, some is crown land, and some is regional.  Help preserve these trails for future mountain bike and multi-use by visiting them, respecting them, and supporting the local trailbuilders.",
    "directions": "To get to Nanaimo, take the ferry from Horseshoe Bay (Vancouver). The ferry crossing is about an hour and a half, and costs about $50 Canadian each way, for a car and two passengers.\r\nOnce off the ferry, follow the highway north in the direction of Qualicum Beach and Comox, but about 5 km up the Nanaimo Parkway, look for Pacific Rim Bicycle\r\n\r\n\r\n on the right; they are 6404 Metral Drive.  They have paper copies of this map, and will give you the very latest on new trails and trail conditions.\r\n\r",
