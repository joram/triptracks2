    "description": "NTS Map: 082N15Time and distance are return. Glacier Lake is the 4th largest in Banff National Park.A great trail through the forest, with a bridged river about 2 kms in.  After about 2 more kms, you leave the forest and get a sweet view of a meandering stream (maybe a river in spring) through some lowlands.  Minor elevation change along the way, but nothing too crazy.  A great trail to take halfway and then return if you don't have all day. In winter please check the local avalanche conditions and bulletins.Editor's note - the river in question is the South Saskatchewan.",
    "directions": "The trailhead is just off the Icefields Parkway, just north of Saskatchewan Crossing (where highway 11 and icefields parkway meet)  The parking area is on the west side of the Parkway, very close to the gates that would close the highway in the event of bad roads, about 1 km north of Saskatchewan Crossing.",
