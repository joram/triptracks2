    "description": "NTS Map: 083H10This is a loop around Tawayik Lake in Elk Island National Park.  The entire trail is grassy and wide with little to none of the technical stuff.  Most of the trip is through aspen parkland, but occassionaly the trail takes you through meadow and around lake / marsh areas.  There are plenty of birds, so this is a great hike for birders.  Expect to see a lot of bison droppings along the trail, if not a herd of the beasts in all their glory.  Admission to the Park was $6.90 per person (Sept).",
    "directions": "From the south park gate, continue north and take the first gravel road on the left to get to the parking area.  Trail head is east of parking.",
