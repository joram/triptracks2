    "description": "This was a 5 day trip we took in May 2009.  Because it was so early in the season a lot of trails were closed and we went on this loop.  One thing good about going early is there was only a few people on the trails so it seemed like we had the whole place to ourselves.  This was a difficult loop and racked up 50 miles in 5 days.",
