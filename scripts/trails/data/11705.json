    "description": "Large sand eskers and hills were left behind by the last ice age as the glaciers retreated and deposited large rocks, boulders, and vast amounts of sand. These sand ridges are the second highest point in Manitoba, behind Baldy Mountain.  Trails north east of the parking lot range in difficulty from moderate to very difficult. Riders will experience short, but steep elevation changes.   Some steep ascents and descents are situated on eroded unstable sand, so traction is very poor.",
    "directions": "Trails are located 13 km northeast of Marchand, MB.  Drive east of Marchand on Hwy #210 for 7.7 km, turn northeast on an unnamed gravel road for 4.6 km then turn south on an unnamed gravel road for 1 km to the Suicide Hill parking lot.   Trailheads are located on the north and south sides of the parking area.",
