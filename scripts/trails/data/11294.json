    "description": "This is a series of waterfalls on a brook flowing out of Spider Lake near Dartmouth, Nova Scotia.  The brook is located in the Halifax Water protected area.  I visited this site by paddling on Lake Major for about 7km one way but you can also access this place by bushwhacking from spider Lake Estates..about 3km one way.  The falls are set in a small ravine.  The falls are not very high in size but the sheer number of them makes them a worthwhile detour...plus there aren't many falls within HRM.  What is also interesting is one the side wall of the ravine.  There are numerous small holes that you you could almost slide into...really interesting geology.  the forest is a mature softwood on the side of the stream but there is a big blow down area close by so there are lots of big trees down and lots of small resurgence to really  get in your way.",
    "directions": "Waverley Rd.  Turn on spider Lakes Estates Rd and park at it's far end.  Walk under power lines and take any trails leading you to the right.  At some point the trail finished by Spider Lake.  Then its some more faint trails or a bushwhack to the outlet of the lake...or paddle Lake Major to the place where this stream flows into it...see my post on Lake Major paddle....",
