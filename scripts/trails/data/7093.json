    "description": "This is the best trail in Guelph, lots of up and downs, tree roots and rocks, all single track, nice rest stop near the end on the biggest hill in Puslinch County.",
    "directions": "From Downtown go south on Gordon until you hit Arkell, make a left, trail head is past Watson Rd. on the right.  There is also a way to get there from the Arkell Side trail but you will have to do some exploring.",
