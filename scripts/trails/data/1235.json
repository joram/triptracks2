    "description": "The Clyde River paddle trip starts in New Glassgow, PEI, and the sweet part of the deal is that you can start and or finish by visiting the PEI Preserves company for tea, scones, or what ever your heart fancies.\r\n\r\nThe put-in point is along a small little community park on the left side of the road. Because the River is tide sensitive, there are shallow spots, but not belly grazers. On a high tide, you can explore further behind the Preserves company. \r\n\r\nThis is a great autumn evening paddle when day light hours are your nemesis. We set out at 7pm and were taking kayaks out at just after 8 under headset lamp.  I suggest two hours if you dawdled or wanted to explore past the Rustico Road bridge out into Rustico Bay.\r\n\r\nAlong the way, you'll find rural farms and fields, and the occasional home and cottage owners. The sounds of geese and the sights of fall colors will be in full by October.  Another shire of Hobbitland.\r\n\r",
