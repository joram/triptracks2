    "description": "NTS Map:082o04This trail is a continuation of the Egypt Lake Trail .Elevation gain - 45m (150 ft).An 8.30 start for a planned easy scenic day with excursions without packs to Egypt and Scarab lakes, the latter with its not to be missed waterfall plummeting into Egypt Lake below. The switchback climb beneath the two lakes provides fine views and good excuses for a rest. The walk up Whistling Pass made all the more interesting by the family groups of whistling hoary marmots looking down from their vantage points on huge boulders. We sat in the sun on top of the Pass with a Dutch couple who told us how good hiking was in Norway! But what could be better than this, overlooking Haiduk Lake and on towards Ball Pass. A long lunch at the lake and more video footage saw us arrive at Ball Junction at 3.30 with plenty of time for washing - again we had this site to ourselves. Next trail is the Floe Lake Trail .In winter please check the local avalanche bulletins and conditions.",
