    "description": "This is a hike in a series of explorations I am conducting near New Anna.  I am looking for the elusive MacNutt Fall.  we started off on a logging road and followed it to where my gps was pointing down the slope and into an evergreen thicket.   After 300m or so we emerged on the side of a small ravine and followed the stream down to look for a fall.  On one side of the stream is a mature hardwood forest....makes you imagine what the whole forest used to look like.   After a while and when the topo lines weren't giving me much hope, we retraced our steps upstream....big mistake...the whole upstream portion has been repeatedly damned by beavers and it makes the hiking a most unenjoyable experience.  close to where the stream crosses the logging road, I did find a mound of rock that looked too fake to be natural.  the mineral database did not offer any old mine working there so the mystery remains.",
    "directions": "Truro Rd...past silica Lake there is a snowmobile trail at N45\u00b0 34' 29.0\" W63\u00b0 17' 49.7\".  turn on it and follow it to a secoindary logging road on your left.  the small falls are at N45\u00b0 35' 17.2\" W63\u00b0 16' 02.1\"",
