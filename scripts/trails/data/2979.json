Quite good when combined with the other offerings from Cypress.\nTrail Descriptions for Cypresss Mountain trails for mountain biking can be found here.",
    "directions": "Up Cypress on the second switch back on you right (while going up), there will be a gap in the cement divider. In that gap (the gap is pretty long, and is almost in the middle of the swich back) there will be a little patch of gravel (very small) and there will be some bike tracks. Also in the trees at the trail entrance, there will be a little bit of surveyor tape stuff. go in and have fun!",
