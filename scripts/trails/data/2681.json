    "description": "NTS Map: 083H05This 460 acre park is located in the North Saskatchewan River valley of Southwest Edmonton.  Originally operating as a ranch, it was acquired by the city in 1964.  There are a multitude of trails to choose from, ranging from easy gravel double-track to technical, rooty singletrack above sheer drops into the river.  This is an excellent area for exploring as there are too many trails to use in just one day.  From the parking area one can head southwest toward the Anthony Henday overpass and cross the river, or you can go northeast and connect up to Fort Edmonton Park.  Terwillegar park itself is an offleash dog park, so expect to see a lot of puppies, although they generally tend to stay in the open meadow area and off the trails.",
    "directions": "Follow Rabbit Hill Road Westbound until it turns into a gravel road and descends into a ravine.  Parking is at the bottom of the hill.",
