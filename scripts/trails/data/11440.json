    "description": "This trail leads to a lookout of the Kootenay and Slocan Valleys. The trail is 5 km round trip with 315 m of vertical elevation gain. The trip takes about 3 hours.The trail should be considered moderate as it is undeveloped but well flagged. The trail connects a series of game trails so be careful not to follow one of these instead. If you don't see flagging you are off the trail. Grades are moderate but there are a couple of short steeper sections.If the upper trail flagged in red is not adventurous enough for you, there is also a difficult lower bushwhack trail flagged in blue. It starts about 1.3 kms along the trail flagged in red. The blue trail mostly does not follow any trail but is flagged well. It has dead fall to climb over, is steeper than the red trail in places and has steeper side slopes.",
    "directions": "The trail head is on Pass Creek Road, 2.1 km from the bridge over the Slocan River. Look for red flagging.",
