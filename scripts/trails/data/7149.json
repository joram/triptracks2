    "description": "Fire Ant Trail is one of a growing collection of trails within the eastern region of PEI. Developed a few years ago by artist Ahmon Katz, this trail is puctuated at every junction with markers ranging from buoys to bike part sculptures.\nBecause it goes through private land, the trail builder would like you to seek permission to be in the area. His place is the first you encounter along the dirt road, running West.\nThe route is a latice work of options that runs east-west along a natural gully. Maintanence has been done recently to revamp the trail, including the clearing of leaves off of 80 percent of the path. You'll find pleasure in its trail diversions such as blunted hill climbs and a wicked roller coaster ride. Some areas remain blocked with blowdown along the far western extent, but as part of a trail collection, this one is definately worth visiting. Just up the dirt road from where the trail attains its most westerly reach lies the Gairloch trail. Putting the two together via the road would make a great day outting either on foot, mtn bike or snowshoe.",
    "directions": "From the TCH out of Charlottetown, look for Orwell corner, and turn left. On your first right, is route 23 Take it until you reach the intersection to highway 204. This junction is Gairloch Road, and right at the intersection lies the trailhead on the left hand side of the dirt road by the stop sign.",
