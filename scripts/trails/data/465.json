    "description": "The trail starts from a rocky bluff overlooking Rossland and the surrounding valleys and mountains (great photo op).  The trail starts with some steep rock faces and then enters into the trees.  From here it is mostly steep single track.  The highlight of the trail is Johnny Rock, a 13 foot huck off a rock cliff to a natural tranny.",
    "directions": "Check with local bike shop (Sacred Ride) or local guide (Summit Rides).",
