    "description": "We've ridden the whole Iron Horse now.  This was a nice ride through the countryside, pleasant but not spectacular scenery.  The last 8 or so km into Bonnyville becomes very sandy, too sandy for this wuss to ride anyways.  Fortunately you are right beside the highway here and can jump over to finish up.  There is a decent little motel downtown that we rode up to & got a nice clean room & more importantly, a hot shower.\r\n\r\nA reclaimed Rail Trail and 'Linear Park' administered by a consortium of area municipalities and veteran trail builders. Interesting path takes you through a number of towns so you don't even have to pack a tent if you don't want to. We stayed in motels in Smoky Lake, Spedden, and St. Paul on our 4 day trip of other sections.\r\nThe entire trail is described in more detail in 5 other trailpeak entries, \"Search Trails\" and type in Iron Horse to find the 5 listings. Refer to the individual sections for detailed GPS logs.\r\nNor do you have to do it all. The handy proximity to towns means you can do whatever section(s) you want. \r\n\r\nNice looking trail in surprisingly scenic countryside. Sure it's flat(ish) but really, really pretty countryside. You will be pleasantly surprised if you don't just HAVE to have singletrack and steep grinds to ride up & down. \r\n\r\nAn in-depth website covers most aspects of the trail, please see http://ironhorsetrail.ca/ for more info. \r\n\r\nThere is another interesting spot just East of Ashmont, the 'WYE' where the trail splits to the NE leg to Cold Lake and the SE leg to Heinsberg. \r\n\r\nThis trail is in the general area of:",
    "directions": "You can pick it up just about anywhere along it's length, Waskatenau in the West, Cold Lake in the NE, Heinsburg/Elk Point in the SE, St.Paul, Vilna, etc.\r\n\r\nVilna, Ashmont, Spedden, Bonnyville, and more all have staging areas with parking.\r\n\r\nYou could even camp at a number of places along the line such as the WYE (above) and Edourdville.",
