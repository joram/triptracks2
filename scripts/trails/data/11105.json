    "description": "A short hike to see one of the world?s highest tides measurements at over 52ft!!!  Some say the highest tides are in the Bay of Ungava (Qc) but the tides at this particular location in the Bay of Fundy are equally if not higher plus you can easily drive there in comparison.   The hike in the park takes you to the lighthouse which also house a museum.  A short downhill hike will bring you  to the entrance of the staircase which brings you to the seafloor.  I did not time my second visit to this site very well.  The tides goes down about an inch/minute and after only 1.5hrs after high tide, there is still too much water to be able to visit the offshore island, sea stack and sea caves that I have visited before at this site. From talking to the folks who run the museum, you should go at this site approximately 2.5/3 hours after high tide to be able to explore to your leisure.  At the bottom of the staircase, right in front of you is the island which has some small sea caves on the opposite side.  To the right is a sea stack and behind the sea stack lies a large sea cave.",
    "directions": "Highway 354 towards Noel.   Continue straight onto Burncoat Rd and follow it to the entrance of the park on your right.",
