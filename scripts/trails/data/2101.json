    "description": "This picturesque river is the third of Quebec's Triple Play. During the summer months, the lower river rapids are fast with tight turns. A good combination of ledge and straight wave runs with good volume throughout the season.",
    "directions": "You travel Hwy 17E from North Bay Ontario or Hwy 17W from Ottawa to Rolphton Ontario. Turn on Swisha Road and continue to Rapides-des-Joachims Quebec. Here you would continue your journey by air. There are no roads available - fly in is your only option. You would book your flight in advance. Provisions for pick-up shuttle service is available.",
