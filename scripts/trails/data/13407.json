    "description": "Great multi-day hike. We had 5 nights on the trail. Our first night on the trail was at Whitehorn camp ground about 11kms in. On the second day we hiked to the Berg Lake camp ground (10km) where we will stay for 3 nights. While there we did two day hikes, one to Hargreaves Lake/Glacier and Toboggan Falls (9km) and one to Snowbird Pass (24km). On the fifth day we began our hike back out and stopped for the final night of camping at Kinney Lake camp ground (14km). On the sixth day we hiked the remaining 7km out to the trailhead. We were amazed by the views of beautiful lakes, glaciers, ice fields, waterfalls, meadows and mountains. The highlight was to see Mount Robson up close.",
    "directions": "From Vancouver, BC - Drive east on Hwy 1 to Hope. At Hope follow Hwy 5 (north) through Kamloops and on to Valemount. From Valemount drive east on Hwy 16 to the Mount Robson Visitor's center and trailhead.",
