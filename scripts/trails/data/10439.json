    "description": "This is has to be one of the most popular 4-5 day loops in Algonquin Park.\rThat said, if you head up during the spring or in my case late September, chances are you won't run into many out there. This trail consists of about 70km worth of paddling depending on where you camp, as well as about 7km of portage scattered through out the trip. As daunting as that sounds, their broken up very well generally ranging from 200-700m with the exception of one 2300m portage which you will encounter on either the first or last day of your trip. Terrain is quite level. \r\rThe paddling is fantastic. It offers a range of little lakes, big lakes, marshy waters, streams and small slow moving rivers here and there.\r\rLots of wildlife. McIntosh marsh is an especially good place to see moose.\r\rI put this as moderate difficulty due to the length, as well as there are a couple big lakes which can be a little intimidating to beginner canoeists in bad weather. \r\rDay 1:\rCanoe Lake \rPortage 1\rJoe & Little Joe Lake\r\rDay 2:\rPortage 3\rBaby Joe Lake\rPortage 4\rBurnt Island Lake\rPortage 5\rOtterslide Lake\r\rDay 3:\rPortage 6\rOtterslide Cr.\rPortage 7\rOtterslide Cr.\rPortage 8\rOtterslide Cr.
