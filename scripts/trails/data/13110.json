    "description": "This is one of those exploration hikes that didn't pan out exactly as I expected.  I wanted to explore this brook forever but I donate live close to it.  Its located near Iona.   A 1890's report described it as having conglomerate shaped into grotesque forms and having numerous potholes and falls!  I was hooked!   I finally got to stop there at the end of an epic exploration day.  I was bit tired and pressed for time but I couldn't miss this opportunity!  I hiked into this little valley and could see some conglomerate formations so I was pleased.  the oaks on either side are tall so that was good too!   I made it a first to s small natural water slide type fall of about 10ft.  It was ;pretty cool looking but I wanted to see the grotesque forms so I didn't spend a lot of time there or at any of the smaller falls on the tributaries flowing into this brook.  I got into an area where the ravine walls were bare conglomerate rock so I was thinking...I am close to something!Unfortunately I hiked a ways upstream and never found the grotesque forms or waterfalls...maybe they described it wrong in the report or mislabelled the brook although there was a lot of that conglomerate rock everywhere.",
