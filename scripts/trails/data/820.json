    "description": "Elevation gain: 1500m (4920ft)\nAverage grade: 12.5%\nHigh point 1706m (5598ft) \nNTS Map: 92G7. The trail is well-maintained and a fairly easy go despite the 1160m gain to the cabin. For the first two hours the trail is a pleasant meander through the forest. Alder Flats (5km in) is a beautiful camping spot for those who want to take baby steps, especially in autumn when the trees are a gorgeous yellow. After Alder Flats the trail gets steep, not heart-attack steep, but enough to get the lungs going.\nFor many, reaching panorama ridge and the small alpine cabin will  be enough for one day--remember, most of the elevation gain is over the 4 km from the flats. After the cabin the route to the Ears is pretty clear--a 3 km ridge-walk that finds you on loose rock and a patch of year-round snow. The views aren't going to knock your socks off, but the Ears themselves are a Middle-Earth-looking fortress-type peak, and the colourful deciduous trees make this a great fall hike.",
    "directions": "Follow the Lougheed Hwy East from Vancouver, turning off at the second Dewdney Trunk exit. Follow Dewdney to 232nd St and take a left. There will be a Golden Ears Park sign on the right at Fern Crescent (4-way stop).  Take a right here and follow the main, windy road right into the park gates. After the gates continue along the road to its end at a pay parking lot with signs for upper and lower canyon trails. Follow the main upper canyon trail until branching trails eventually disappear after 2 km or so.",
