    "description": "NTS Map:92B12.  This is a rather short trail that is often overlooked in the Victoria area, yet a great quick side trip when visiting Goldstream Provincial Park, especially during the monsoon season and the Salmon spawn in November.The Goldmine trail is about 1.8 kilometres long and has three waterfalls, the highest having a drop of 47 meters straight down. A train trestle towers 85 meters over the river; it's on an active line that has at least three trains per day. The trail is fairly good, fenced in the most dangerous areas.",
    "directions": "There are several ways to get to the Goldmine trailhead. If heading South on the Trans-Canada Highway there is a small unmarked parking lot on the left shoulder of the highway just after the end of the downhill portion of the Malahat. If heading North to Goldstream Park from Victoria, the easiest way is to park at the Goldstream day use area, walk towards the Freeman King Nature house and scoot through a short tunnel under the highway; impassable when it's raining though so you may have to carefully run across the Trans-Canada at the intersection of the Nature House access road.",
