    "description": "A quiet paddle around a well populated Lake in Colchester Ct.  Our friends have a small summer place on the lake but it is accessible by all from the ramp at the Northern end of the Lake.  Lots of kayaks, canoes and pontoon boats but the Lake maintains its rural charms and is the perfect place for a twilight paddle.  Hugging the shore all the way around will give you a nice 3.5 miles.  If you want to stretch out and get the heart pumping there is plenty of open water in the middle.  I have never fished there but have seen many others so I suspect its worth a little research in that department.",
    "directions": "Just after Rt. 85 crosses Rt. 2, traveling South, keep an eye for Lake Hayward Rd.  Make a right and travel about 2 miles to a left onto East Shore Drive.  The ramp will be on the right in less than 0.1 miles.",
