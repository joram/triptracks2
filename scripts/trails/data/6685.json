    "description": "A private working ranch with onsite MTB trails and camping and very reasonable prices.  To be fair, it isn't really *mountain* biking but it is a very nice, forested route with a few hills into and along the creek side.\nPonderosa pines surround most of the trails as they wind trough the ranch and there are some basic trail features.  The trails have been built by IMBA trained professionals and they show it.  You never feel as though you are riding back and forth in the same 40 acres for the first section, it is all twisty fun.\nAn on-site Bike hospital is there for any needed repairs and stock some wheels, tubes, tires and the usual ER items.\nI kept thinking about a person ER as I saw the horns on those future Fuddrucker's employees.  Those horns would hurt (I kept visualizing a plethora of Hanna-Barbara cartoons...  ow.. ouch...  ooow... owe - you know the shtick).  Thankfully, they were happy to hang out in the hay field, though I didn't push my luck and ceded the trail to the one standing in the middle of it.\nWhether you need camping space, or want indoor accommodations in the bunk house, it's a deal to stay there.",
    "directions": "The short answer is it is 25 miles N of the I10 about 1/2 way between Houston and San Antonio.  If you find Schulenburg then go North past La Grange and into Warda, TX.  Travelling North in the North edge of Warda (don't blink), look for Owl Creek Road on the right.  Turn right down there for 1/2 mile & look for the ranch on the left.",
