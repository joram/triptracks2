    "description": "Fantastic views, probably the best in the Glacier National Park (Rogers Pass).  1250m to 2045m, this trail climbs to the crest where avalanches that can reach the Trans-Canada start in winter. Leave the Illecillewaet Campground (common departure area for many trails in this area) and veer left where it starts to immediately climb and switchback.  You will reach an upper sub-alpine on a large ridge which is Avalanche Crest. 3.5 hours uphill and 2 hours back.   There is GPS data attached to this trail (see \"download GPS\"), which if loaded into your GPS can help you find route points.\r\nThe trailhead is on the south side of the highway, near the campground.  Ask at the park office; they also hand out park maps.\r\n\r\n \r\n In winter please check the \nAvaluator",
