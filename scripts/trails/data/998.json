    "description": "A steep hike with a nice view of the open prairies. The cement plant at Exshaw is directly below the trail head, which is an ugly and noisy thing to experience, but you quickly move away from the noise and the view looks away from it. In some ways it is a nice reminder of how humanity has ultimately scarred nature. NTS Map: 082O03Elevation Gain: 603 m (466 ft).Park across the street from the eastern cement plant in Exshaw and hike the ridge to the east of the valley away from the plant.",
