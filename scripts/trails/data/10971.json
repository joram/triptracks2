    "description": "The Bay of Fundy shoreline becomes inaccessible east of Magaretsville except for one spot; Bishop Brook.  On either side of the brook where it flows into the bay, tall cliffs vault into the skyline preventing an easy access to the seashore.Bonus to this hike are the adit and cave located west of where the brook flows into the ocean.  The adit is approximately 6 by 6 feet and maybe 15ft deep or so.  It looks like they were following a vein of some kind.  Walking west towards Margaretsville, you will come upon a large sea cave within a minute or two.  It has a huge entrance and goes in for at least 10m ....pretty impressive sight.  If you walk along the shore in an easterly manner, you will come upon some large rock falls.  These boulders came from the cliffs above you and are testament to the constant movement of the geology in the Bay of Fundy. The start of the trail is definitely used for some campfires and is large enough for people to camp.  A source of freshwater from Bishop Brook is readily available.",
    "directions": "Highway 211 to Bishop Mountain Road.  Take this road to its conclusion at the Bay of Fundy.  the road becomes very bumpy towards the end",
