    "description": "A loop of trails between the Seymour Mainline Rd and Seymour River, the Cemetery on Lillooet Rd. and Camp Brick. Camp Brick is private so avoid riding in the Green Space. \r\n\r\nGo in and explore. At the top of the climb you can get to a viewpoint to see Mt. Seymour. There is GPS data attached to this trail (see \"download GPS\"), which if loaded into your GPS can help you find route points.",
    "directions": "From the Upper Levels Hwy, take exit 22. and drive up Lillooet Rd. Park at the parking area near the LSCR sign. Ride up the trail on the side of the road. Take the first right and explore!\r",
