    "description": "This is a XC mountain bike loop in the Chilcotin range near the town of Gold Bridge, B.C.\r\rThere are a number of loops in the area, but this one is mostly rideable but has a number of somewhat lengthy hike a bike sections due to steep terrain. \r\rThe loop should be done anti-clockwise.",
    "directions": "Head north from Highway 40 up towards Tyax Resort. \r\rIdeally this ride should be done with a two car shuttle. Leave one car lower on the road (before reaching Tyax Resort), and take another up the forestry service road past Tyax resort and continue up the hill to the start of the GPX track provided.",
