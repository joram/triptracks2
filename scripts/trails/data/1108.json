    "description": "Bank Of Montreal in Salmon Arm for detailed directions. It starts off with a gentle fire-road climb for 5km or so, in and out of the trees. Then you're in for some super-technical/fast downhill. It's a steep windy trail, with switchbacks, drop-offs, some off camber corners, wicked berm corners and several short fast steep climbs. It finishes off with a superfast chute down to the highway. Approximate length 15km.",
    "directions": "Rubber Head Salmon Arm, B.C. The trail starts across from the Federated Co-op mill outside of Salmon Arm as you take the highway towards Vernon. You can go to Green Mountain Cycle across from the Bank Of Montreal in Salmon Arm for detailed directions.",
