    "description": "The Flora Lake trail is accessed off the same area as the Lindeman Lake Trail (see trail description). Take the trail on the right of the access road rather than continuing down the road to the Lindeman trailhead. The trail starts out flat but begins a brutal ascent of 1800 m in about 4 km. At the top of the pass, you are in sub alpine meadows. The trail then drops 400 m to the lake. At the lake there are 3 good campsites. The lake is small but has a huge population of small trout. I was amazed to see 3 trout hit a pebble I had tossed into the lake. A sketchy trail follows Flora Creek down to Hicks Creek and the Lindeman Greendrop Trail. I wouldn't recommend you try it unless you have good boots, a compass, map and excellent route-finding skills. It's really not worth it and it does not cover interesting territory. It mostly crosses heavy scree interspersed with heavy brush.",
    "directions": "Follow Chilliwack River road for 40 km. Park on the side of the road (lots of break-ins, better to park in Chilliwack Lake Provincial Park about 1 km further up the road). Hike down the access road, taking the first trail on the right.",
