    "description": "A pleasant grind up from the Sea to Sky Highway takes you through a bit of old growth forest.  Once past the initial hour or so of elevation gain, an easy walk along old logging roads leads us to a rock outcropping with a splendid view of Howe Sound.  If the Chief is too crowded for you, then this well-maintained hike might just astound with the solitude it can provide.",
    "directions": "Travelling North on the Sea to Sky Highway, look for the \"M\" creek bridge about 3 kilometres North of Lions Bay.  The The BC Highways pullout is only about 100 metres North of the bridge, but is accessible only to Southbound traffic, so you will need to find a safe place to turn around beyond the pullout.  The trailhead is on the East side of the highway, at the North end of the parking lot.  A 6x8 sign marks the entrance.",
