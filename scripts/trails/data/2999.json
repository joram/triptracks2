    "description": "NTS Map: 082J10\r\nForan Grade Ridge is an early season Hike near the Sandy McNabb Campground on Highway 546.\r\n\r\nIt's a relatively easy look with the constraint that there many blown down trees one now has to circumvent. (the attached GPS track goes off the trail frequently). You'll also have to close the loop using either the road or a trail along the bank to Sheep river (it's visibile and marked)\r\n\r\nThere are great views to the west and to the east you can see the city of Calgary.\r\n\r\nThe trail is also an equestrian trail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r",
    "directions": "The road is closed at Sandy McNabb from Dec 1 to May 14 so if you during that period you have to walk and extra 1.5 km to trailhead either along road or trail above Sheep river bank.\r\n\r\n1.6km west of Sandy McNabb there is parking and signed trailhead proceed north on obvious trail up the ridge. From summit take switchbacks down to Windy ridge trail and return to highway. From there you can use the road or Sheep trail on south side to return to your vehicle",
