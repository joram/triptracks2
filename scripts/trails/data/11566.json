    "description": "Kenomee Canyon trail is a beautiful walk through wooded landscapes of old growth trees. Amazing waterfalls and five river fords. The terrain on the first half of the trail is fairly demanding with areas of steep uphill and downhill trails. We opted to stay overnight at one of the three camp areas available. Many streams will offer a great spot to filter and replenish water supplies. No camp fires are allowed in the camp areas. Please register with the information center in economy so they have record of your stay and inform them when you have returned.",
    "directions": "Head west on highway 104 and exit at Masstown. Turn right after exiting the highway and continue down highway 4 and then a left turn on highway 2 to economy. Take a right turn to River Phillip road for about 7 kms. Keep right where the road branches. A short right turn will bring you to a parking area. The trail head starts here.",
