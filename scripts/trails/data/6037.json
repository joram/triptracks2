    "description": "The Telemark XC area has just over a dozen trails, ranging from short and flat, to longer and with more ups and downs.  The area is very close to crystal mountain DH ski area, and some of the XC trails at Telemark make their way up crystal mountain.  There are trails groomed for all types of skiing, as well as snowshoeing.  In the summer, these trails can be used for biking and hiking.  They are not very crowded and are a good break from some of the crazier hikes and biking routes in the area.  Winter use does involve paying per use, or becoming a member.   The 7km \"Telemark\" trail has a few climbs and descents and is a good rip.  \"Fern Creek\" is another good long ride.  Memory Lane and Forest Lane are quick rips at around 1 km each.  Maps are easily downloaded at www.telemarkx-c.com.",
    "directions": "Turn up Glenrosa off Highway 97 in Westbank.  follow the road up towards crystal mountain, and you will see the xc ski lodge on your right.  park there.",
