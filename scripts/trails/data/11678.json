    "description": "A series of small falls packed together are found after a 500m bushwhack or so on an unamed logging road near Cameron Settlement. I had been on this brook about 7 years ago to a nice 40 ft on the lower reaches but my old maps were pointing to some potential falls in the upper reaches. Set among a carpet of moss and fern the Black Brook flows out of Black Lake and creates a few falls. Small Falls.\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r",
    "directions": "\r\n\r\nCameron Settlement Rd and Turn on logging road at N45 17.257 W62 31.345 and again turn left at N45 16.369 W62 31.180 and drive to bridge over said stream and walk upstream",
