    "description": "Right in the middle of the city is the entrance to a hidden gem.  As soon as you leave your car and go uphill for a few minutes you enter a hidden world. The noise stops and you are faced with multiple trails which head into the conservations lands.  There are a couple of lakes to see as well as some burbling brooks.  A forest fire a few years ago has left the area quite changed but beautiful.  Vegetation is slowly recovering beside the granitic outcrops. The forest is mainly evergreens with lots of shrubs such as Labrador tea.  there are lots more trail than the gpx files shows.",
