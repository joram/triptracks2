    "description": "This is one of my all time favorite hikes. If you make it to the top on a nice day then you are very lucky. In my opinion, its one of the best views in New England.\r\rThere are many roads that go throughout the state park, however they will be closed until next season (2009). That will require you to tag a mile or two onto this trip. The trip starts on Mt. Greylock road, there is a small parking spot the trail is just down the road from the trailhead. \r\rThe first mile or two are pretty easy with a few steep parts and views almost all the way up. The last 1/2 mile of the trail up Mt. Greylock get very steep and have loose rock along the trail.\r\rThe trail then goes down the southern side of the mountain. The campsite is an awesome one. It overlooks the side of the mountain and the ridge that the AT follows. I would highly recomend staying here.",
    "directions": "Take Rt. 8 to Resevoir road, resevoir road will then turn into Mt. Greylock road the trailhead is about halfway to the summit. I will add a waypoint in my gps info.",
