    "description": "NTS Map:92F10.  This is a great and easy hike on Hornby Island, one of the most beautiful Gulf Islands in BC.  The hike circles the top of Mount Geoffery and provides fantastic views to the west of Denman Island, Vancouver Island and the surrounding waters.  On a warm day a great place to take a picnic lunch and watch the views of the ferry traffic, with both Golden and Bald eagles a common sight.  A great family hike although you do come close to the cliff edge.  For small children (or those adverse to heights) it's very easy to stay away from the edge and still enjoy the scenery.",
    "directions": "On Hornby Island proceed from the ferry terminal to the Co-op grocery store.  At the 4 way stop turn right and proceed for a few miles until you see Strachan road on your right.  Proceed up Strachan and then turn left onto Marylebone road and follow this around to the right where it becomes Euston.  Follow Euston to the end and park in the round about (Note the sign about the school bus turnaround).  From here you will see two trails.  Take the one to the left and follow it along the ridge until the trail ends.  Return along the inner trail just below the ridge and watch for the turn off that will bring you back to the parking lot.  You can get maps on Hornby of the hike, or just use the gps data to make it easier.  Enjoy!",
