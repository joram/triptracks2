    "description": "This is a hike to a fall close to Lantz.   I had explored the upper reaches of this brook by bushwalking to some falls.   However the lower falls are easier to get to with a dirt road leading all the way there.  The road leads past a couple of old pine trees that are amazing inside....makes you wonder what the NS forest used to look like.    The road eventually passes by the small but scenic falls.",
    "directions": "Park off highway 277 at N44 58 37.0 W63 27 56.8.  Walk the road turning to the right when there are forks.  Follow the main road always.  The falls are N44 58 09.6 W63 27 52.0",
