    "directions": "Sumas Mountain is located just east of Abbotsford and can either be hiked from the west or the east side of the mountain. To reach the trailhead of the western approach, take Highway #1 (Trans Canada Highway) east until you reach the town of Abbotsford. Take the Whatcom Road (Exit #95) turnoff and turn left, crossing over the highway overpass. Just after the overpass, make a right-hand turn onto North Parallel Road as it follows alongside the highway. After 2km, turn left onto Sumas Mountain Road. Continue along Sumas Mountain Road for 9km. For the last 0.5km, the road becomes gravel. After making a sharp right-hand corner that heads downhill, the road curves to the left. The trailhead is located in the outer part of this left curve where the gravel has been widened to give space for hikers to park their cars. Look closely for the coloured trail markers as they are easy to miss. \r\r",
