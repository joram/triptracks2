    "description": "34km round trip. Paddled up behind Ladner marine park and checked out the interesting house boats. Backtracked then padded towards Deas island slouth with pit stop at rowing club. Backtracked then up the Fraser and passed over the Deas island tunnel. Crossed over the Fraser to Richmond side. Continued to Stevenson and Garry Point Park for a dinner treat of fish and chips. With wishful thinking that the tide and wind would be with us for the final leg of the trip. No such luck but a short 7-8km straight leg back to the boat launch.\nGreat little trip ;)",
    "directions": "Ladner has a public ramp close to canoe passage as its listed on garmin. Ugly ramp if your attempting to launch at low tide with a trailer. But easy breezing with a kayak :P\nAs river road west bends towards Westham island rd and the bridge. A public boat ramp on the right hand side with lots of parking.",
