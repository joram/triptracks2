    "description": "Steep start to hike, great views down the valley.  Moderate hike, some loose rock on the trail so be careful coming down especially.",
    "directions": "Drive east from Vernon on Highway 6 for 12.3 km to Learmouth Road and follow it to a T junction where you turn left and then right onto Aberdeen Lake Road.  Four km up the road there's a cleared area on the left and a hiking sign near the roadside.  Park here and hike up the hill.",
