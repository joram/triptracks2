    "description": "Another trail up canyon in the Agua Caliente Tribal Preserve.\r\rThis one actually follows a real creek that actually contains water much of the \rtime, despite being in the desert. The Seven Sisters Waterfall is at the end of \rthe trail. Due the abundant water (for a desert that is) much of the canyon \rhas palms along the way.\r\rGPS data returns part of the way via the Coffman trail which climbs a ridge \rwhere you can get a view of the palm line canyon from above.\r\rThe is an admission fee to the preserve. Gates close at 5:00PM and you have \rto be out by then.",
    "directions": "From Palm Springs south on Palm Canyon drive to the Tribal Preserve, where \rthere is right turn just after you pay your admission fee.",
