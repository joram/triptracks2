    "description": "Nice little climbing crag close to Tantallon.  First of all, thanks for all the people who have cleared a path to it.   I\u2019ve bushwacked in this type of forest before and it\u2019s just not fun.  Leaving the road, the trail soon climbs a small hill.  At the top of the hill, the trail turns to the left and enters a tree stand.  At the end of the tres stand is an area that looks like it was burnt a while ago.  The climbing crag is just on the opposite side of it.  If I\u2019m not mistaken the crag was discovered by Peter M. in 2017 or so.  Height would be in range of 20 -30 ft.  Some bolts are noticeable at the top.",
    "directions": "Hammonds Plain Rd, turn on St George Blvd and drive until Virginia Rd on the left.  Turn on Virginia Dr and park at the end in the cul de sac.  Find the hidden trail beside an obvious stump.",
