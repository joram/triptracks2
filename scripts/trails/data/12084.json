    "description": "This is a straightforward path leading to a beautiful waterfall.  The trail strats wide and can be muddy at times.  Soon you are climbing a hill and at the top of the hill the trail gets narrower and ultimately ends at the waterfall where there were signs of a fire pit and a swing rope.",
    "directions": "On the Atigonish-Guysborough Road.  there is a house entrance at approx  45.456819\u00b0, -61.653375\u00b0 and the path leading to the fall is off the driveway to the left.  (the path is on the left hand side of the brook looking upstream)",
