    "description": "Time and distance are round trip. Elevation gain - ~250'.Although Wall Lake is catalogued in the Alberta section, it is actually in B.C., in Akamina-Kishinena Provincial Park, in the farthest SE corner of the province, adjoining Waterton Lakes N.P. However, the nearest trailhead is in Waterton, at  Akamina Pass.This trail is easy and very popular. The first 1km  rises fairly quickly, but don't be dismayed, after that it levels off and generally stays that way for the remainder of the hike. Just take your time going up the that first km and you'll be fine.The first 3km of the trail follow an old roadbed which carries on into B.C. At 3km, the trail turns left off the road and continues for 3km in gently rolling forest to Wall Lake.Just before the Wall Lake junction, you will see a sign for Forum Falls, Forum Lake and Akamina Ridge (left turn). A short 5 minute diversion here will take you to Forum Falls, a worthwhile side trip, especially in a wet year.Wall Lake sits at the bottom of a huge wall of rock, along the top of which runs Akamina Ridge. If you go around the lake to your right, you will find several nice spots to have your lunch. Along the way you will pass the sign for Bennett Pass. This is the trail to Akamina Ridge for those who don't want to scramble up to the ridge from Forum Lake.This is also a popular cross-country ski trail in winter. Return the way you came.",
