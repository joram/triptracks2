    "description": "A pleasant mix of open grass, sage lands and forest. There is something for everyone and no real extreme hills. There is a gentle climb up, but an easy ride or hike. If you are a beginner in the forest, this is a good series to hike and is suitable for kids on bikes.",
    "directions": "From Kamloops, head East on the Trans Canada. Exit at the Barnhartvale exit. There are two accesses to the trails. The first is across from Gardiner Rd which is 7.5km. The second is Robbins Range which is the road a bit further up the road and is 8.8km from the highway.I was interested in the Robbins Range entrance so that is where I started my GPS track. When I got there I headed down to the lake (dried up pond) and went around it to look for the trail. I did find a bit of one, but it disappeared fast so I deadheaded up the hill, until I hit the #1 trail. You can get a very good map of the trails at:http://www.kamloopshikingclub.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Barnes.pdfWhen I came back down the trail at the end of my hike, I discovered the trail from the Robbins Range entrance. When you park, pull straight in towards a bit of a hump and then walk up the hump and you will find the trail. My GPS track is for the most part, a sample of each of the trails. As I said the trails are very well marked with trail markers and numbers. The only place it wasn't marked was on trail #4. I got about 2/3 of the way around and came to a split. There was a washed out road on the right which had a tree on it. On the left was a trail which I took. In a bit, I came to a trail split and took the right, which turned out to be trail #1 and the left, trail #4 continuing.If you are looking for forest, I would recommend #1, #3 & #5. If you want open grasslands, some of trail #3 and most of trail #2. On a warm summer day, after hiking grasslands, it is very pleasant to hike the forest and smell all the pleasant smells only trees can give.My stats:Total distance: 8.9kmTotal time:2h 8mTotal ascent: 250mTotal descent: 249m",
