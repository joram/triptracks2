    "description": "Sabino Canyon is one of the most popular hiking destinations in Tucson and permits the use of mountain bikes before 9am and after 5pm.  The views from within the canyon, particularly if you take one of the many offshoot trails into the wilderness, are amoungst the most stunning in southern Arizona.  Sunsets in this area are gorgeous, almost every day.  The trail is mainly fire road and old asphalt that present little difficulty, but the hike or ride into the canyon is worth it to enjoy the cool breeze in the summer and serene beauty of this lush oasis in the desert. Bikes are only permitted before 9:00am and after 5pm.For guided hiking and biking trips in Arizona, check out aoa-adventures.com.",
    "directions": "From downtown Tucson, take Oracle Road North to Ina Road, turn right (East) stay on Ina which turns into Sunrise eventually, and will ultimately dead-end at Sabino Canyon Road. Turn left and the entrance to the Sabino Canyon Recreation Area will be on your right.",
