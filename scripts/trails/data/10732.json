    "description": "Launch at Beaubears Interpretive centre as they have a ramp and parking.  It is some 7 miles up the south west arm of the Miramichi River to the mouth of the Barnaby river.  The river is only navigable a short distance due to rapids.  It can be a hard paddle back if you have a strong north wind and the tide is incoming.",
    "directions": "The launch site is at 35 St. Patrick's Drive in Nelson, NB.",
