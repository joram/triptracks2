    "description": "This is a no trail kind of trail...you will need to bushwhack and there is no flagging tape or set trail.  If you do decide to go you will be rewarded by a nicely hidden waterfall of about 30ft.  What's nice about it is that you wouldn't expect one to be there.  Well how did I end up there then?  Well I saw a faint line on the sat imagery and followed my instincts.  \n\nFrom a well travelled gravel road, you turn unto a secondary one that you can still drive on.  after a while some old field will appear on the left.  Park here and start walking towards the brook hidden at the edge of the field...Once in the woods, follow it downstream for a few hundred metres to what remains of perhaps a mill and then the fall immediately below.",
    "directions": "TCH to Kingsville.  Turn onto MacIntyres Mt Rd.  At the main Y intersection go to the left (smaller road).  Park around 45.776109, -61.376700 or drive just a bit more to the actual stream crossing and just follow it downstream to the fall.",
