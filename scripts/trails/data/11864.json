    "description": "A multipurpose trail that starts at the Cougar Creek parking lot and traverses along the valley behind the Silver Tip golf course all the way over to Harvie Heights. There is a fairly steep climb at the start, and then it levels off for more ups-and-downs as you head west. There are excellent views of the valley and Rundle Mountain. The trail can be done as out-and-back or as a loop by connecting with Meander Trail and coming back on the Canmore pathway system. Due to the sun exposure, the trail typically dries faster than trails on the south side of the valley (e.g., Canmore Nordic Centre).",
    "directions": "From the Cougar Creek parking lot head north along the west-side of the creek bed. The trailhead is marked by a small diamond sign, approximately 400 m from the parking lot.",
