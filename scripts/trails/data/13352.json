    "description": "After exhausting the main rivers and brooks of the Cobequid Hills, I started to explore the smaller tributaries.  The Chiganois river has lots of falls and even a small slot canyon, I expected that a tributary of it might contain some hidden gems.\n\nFrom the logging road, follow your gps until it points away from the road and bushwack to the stream.  Plunge into the ravine and discover 2 20ft falls.",
