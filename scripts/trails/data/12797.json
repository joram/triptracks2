    "description": "Minister Brook has a few waterfalls approximately 700m  upstream from the main road.  Apart from a few squirrels, you will have this place to yourself.  A logging road comes closer to the site  but it seemed in disrepair.  Instead, I set off from the main rd and walk the side of the stream as I thought there might be falls on this brook.   From time to time, there are a few smaller falls of 1-3ft.  However, the prize is at the end.  First is a 4ft drop but then further upstream is a nice slider type20ft  fall between rocks walls.  Just upstream of the slider is a large secluded pool with a true drop fall of about 5ft.  This place is worth the detour!",
