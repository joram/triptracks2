    "directions": "Travelling west, the best approach from Highway 18 is to drive into the Town of Lake Cowichan, turn right onto North Shore Road, and fork left onto Meade Creek Road. After crossing two little bridges, just past a trailer court, make a left turn on to the Marble Bay Road. Continue along a winding road until you come to a sign ?University Property?. To the right is a locked yellow gate, maintained by the Scout/Guide Camp Committee. Near this gate is a parking area for hikers. Please leave the roadways clear. The camp or trail head is about 0.8 km from the gate. It is about 6 km from the centre of the town of Lake Cowichan to the Scout gate.",
