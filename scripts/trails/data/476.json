    "description": "A sweet flowy and technical trail, excellent for expert, advanced and intermediate riders. Definitely nothing but a headache for beginners. All natural terrain, steeps, rock faces, roots galore, trees; you name it, Cypress has it.\nTrail Descriptions for Cypresss Mountain trails for moutain biking can be found here.",
    "directions": "Take Cypress Mountain exit. Head up Cypress. At the first switchback, park your lower shuttle car. Continue up until you reach the first provincial picnic grounds (not the lookout) and park here.  Cross the road on your bike and head down the trail past the barricade. Now you'll follow double track road for a short distance up-hill.  You can get a lot of speed up on the lower part of the trail. This is one of my favourite trails on Cypress.",
