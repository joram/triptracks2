    "description": "The Hike is close the town of Vernon BC Canada on the west side of Okanagan Lake and 5 km long, elevation gain 442,   max slope 45.5 %  Average slope 14.9% . Great hike in the spring while things stay green but later in the summer it dry's out but excellent views of Okanagan Lake. Some of the start of the trail has been impacted by atv use which is sad but you get passed that quickly. Elevation starts at +/- 697m to about +/- 1040m.",
    "directions": "From Vernon heading to Kamloops on Hwy 97 turn off onto Westside Road till you get to Evely Recreation site  , and turn up the road away from the lake in a westerly direction the road soon changes to gravel and is a rough road. Location of  access point off Westside roads is 50\u00b012'26.29\"N  119\u00b028'17.17\"W about 6.6 km. If you are camping at Evley Rec Site it is a short access.",
