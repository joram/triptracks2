    "description": "This trail follows the Middletown Rd allowance and goes through the Beverly Swamp. \r\rFor the most part the trail is relatively easy with the exception of several very steep hills called drumlins. These hills will test your biking skills because they are so steep. There is a long boardwalk through the swamp on the north end which is interesting. The middle section is on a road that connects the offroad sections.  The steepest hills are on the south end of the trail.\r\rIf you are downloading the gpx file, have a look at the elevation changes.",
    "directions": "North Trailhead: Follow Hwy 6 south of the 401 for approx. 6kms and turn right on Gore Rd. The trail head is about 1km down Gore Rd.\r\rSouth Trailhead: Is approx 7kms from Hwy 6 on Concession 6.",
