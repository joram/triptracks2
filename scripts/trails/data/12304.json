    "description": "This a really cool spot near Bridgetown.  In the spring and fall as you look up the mountain from the highway, you can see some cliffs.  I decided to try and visit those.  I spotted a logging road close by and set off on it.  It became more narrow and turned into an ATV trail.  It rose a bit but then leveled off and actually started to go down a hill.  just past a cabin, turn left...there is a sign for east sand lake.  Not much further is another split.  I turned to the right ...pretty soon i was in a deciduous forest and the ATV trail was going down the N mountain.  I veered of into the woods 9there might be a path) and about 250 m later I came to the top of the cliffs.  The view is magnificent up there.  there is a big scree slope under the cliffs and there was some webbing on one of the trees.  Great pic nic stop!",
