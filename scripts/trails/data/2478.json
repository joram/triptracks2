    "description": "NTS Map: 082J15A difficult but popular trail that has brutal climbs and out of control downhills. Wear armour! Lots of rocks and roots to navigate make this even more challeging. Try riding this one in both directions for a new experience.",
    "directions": "In Bragg Creek, park at Station Flats or at the Base of the Moose Mtn fire road. There are trail maps at both locations but at Moose Mtn you have to travel up the road roughly 2km to view it.",
