    "description": "The Brunswick Mountain trail begins at the gate and follows the same gravel logging road as The Lions trail for the first half hour. After about 15 minutes from the start, it reaches an intersection, take a right turn, another 15 minutes from here there is another intersection, this time you want to take a left turn, a right turn takes you to Mount Harvey or The Lions. Not far from this junction you will cross Magnesia Creek. From here the trail steepens and winds around and when you see a sign \"Hat Mountain\", follow that direction into a forest with lots of switchbacking and steady climb. At approximately 1500m elevation this trail intersects with Howe Sound Crest Trail, beyond this point the trail is very steep and rough with exposed sections, drop offs and loose rock. At the top of Brunswick Mountain, the view is a 360 degree glorious panorama. To return, you can retrace your ascent route. If you have trekking poles, bring them for this hike, they helped me a lot coming down.GPS Waypoints Reference:WPT001  Parking lot/gateWPT002  The second intersection from startWPT003  Hat Mountain SignWPT004  Intersection with Howe Sound Crest TrailWPT005  Peak of Brunswick Mountain",
