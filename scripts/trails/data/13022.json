    "description": "After asking an employee at the ski hill, we learned the trail head was located behind private property. 45\u00b037'06.4\"N 63\u00b033'24.8\"W Its a steep but wide trail, eventually half way up it levels off for a nice walk. There are several intersections just follow the marking tape that has been on the trail the whole view. Once you reach the summit, its very worth the step climb, as it reveals a beautiful view(45\u00b037'07.1\"N 63\u00b032'12.7\"W)",
