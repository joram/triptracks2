    "description": "A straightfoward 2KM uphill slog to a telecommunications tower above Alice Lake - it's a maintenance road and in good condition but it will be a hard ride uphill for mountain bikers although there were fresh tracks on the road the day that I did this trip.From the furthest parking lot at Alice Lake look for the trail sign and gate and the start of the road up.You won't get any real views until near the top. At the top you will get views of Mt Garibaldi - the Tantalus range and the town of Squamish.On the downhill return you will also see the peaks of the Goat Range - Sky Pilot etc.If you want a little extra exercise while visiting the Alice Lake Campsite this would provide it but it isn't worth a separate trip to the area.  Note: Be aware of any parking fees.",
    "directions": "Drive the Sea to Sky highway to Alice  Lake park - take the picnic and day use area road to the very end  and look for the start of the trail by the beach area.",
