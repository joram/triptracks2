    "description": "Another hike to complete near Fairy Hole is the falls on Bains Brook.  This had been in my gps for a lot of years.  Just never got around to it or that area.   I set off from Mine Road.  Obviously the shortest route is through the road of the old quarry but its chained up so I decided to find another path.  From the Mine Road bushwack about 200m to Bains Brook.  Now there are a few branches of this rook so follow the one leading to the first fall at around N46\u00b0 17' 44.9\" W60\u00b0 26' 42.3\".   This is the smaller two tier fall.  A rope is installed on the left before the fall but you don\u2019t need it.  After the fall continue upstream.  Another rope appears.  Again use it if you need to but the terrain is not that extreme.  Soon you will stand at the foot of a gorgeous 40ft fall at;   N46\u00b0 17' 42.8\" W60\u00b0 26' 50.8\"",
    "directions": "New Campbleton Road. And turn on Mine Rd right after the quarry entrance.  Park anywhere  but don\u2019t block anything and start walking on the Mine Road.  The GPS coordinates above will take you to the falls.",
