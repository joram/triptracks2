    "description": "Located in the centre of Surrey, Green Timbers park is an urban forest with lots of trails etc to keep you walking or biking for a few hours.  On this particular trip I biked down the Birch Trail past Green Timbers Lake, crossed 96th Ave and followed a number of trails in that area.  Then the rain started so I returned to my starting point by following the Salal Trail to Cedar Trail and back past the lake to the entrance off of 100th Ave.\nThere are more trails on the north side of 100th that are a little less developed but still very enjoyable.  The bikers are supposed to remain on the gravel trails but there were lots of tire treads on the other trails. There are a couple of creeks within the park and some bridges crossing them. Trails from the park connect to the Surrey Greenway system that follows along the Hydro right-of-way.",
    "directions": "Main entrance, parking and seasonal wash-rooms are located off of 100th Ave between 144 and 148 Street. There is also a trail-head at 96th and the Fraser Highway--just look for the Urban Forest sign (but parking is limited here).",
