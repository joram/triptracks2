    "description": "Great hike early or lake in the season.  Very popular with mountain bikers.  Park at the Barrier Lake Picnic area and cross the causeway to the trailhead.Within a kilometer you will reach an intersection in the trail. Heading left will take you along the lake at low elevations. Veering right  into the trees will take to up the mountain quickly and keep you at a high elevation for most to the hike. This is my preferred route.",
    "directions": "Highway 1 West to Kananaskis exit. Highway 40 to Barrier lake parking lot.",
