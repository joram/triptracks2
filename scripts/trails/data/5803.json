    "description": "An easy, well-maintained loop around the lake. A great driving break, fast cross-country skiing, or if you want to combine a short hike with swimming and a picnic in the summer. It's rather nice in the sense that it is on a summit, so you get some nice mountains in the distance, unfortunately it IS close to the highway, so even if you aren't walking below it, you can still see and hear the big rigs.\r\rNot much to this one... you start at the main beach area where there is a cooking shelter and picnic tables, and follow the marked trails in either direction around the lake. The trail is pretty much level and stays close to the lakeshore on the east and west sides, then pulls away from it on the south side to avoid the heavy marshland. The west side is fairly close though 10m below) the highway... if you have ignored the leash rules up till now, you may want to leash your dogs through this stretch. \r\rThough dogs aren't allowed on the beach, there are a few 'dog rock' areas around the lake, as well as a rope swing.",
    "directions": "26km north from Rossland on Hwy 3b (where it meets hwy 3) or 26km west from Castlegar along hwy 3 (where it meets 3b). There are clear turn-off signs from all directions - the parking area is massive and features one of those ghastly giant billboards featuring local business logos and a map of the Kootenays.",
