    "description": "Probably the nicest ride you can do close (in really) to red deer.  This keeps you on unpaved single track for the most part with good stunt sections at both the start and the middle part.  There is a short amount of bike path riding but none of it is on the road except across the bridge.\nLots of differn't routes to take here, this ones pretty fun though.",
    "directions": "Park at the MTB park on 79th St two blocks east of Gaetz ave.  The parking spot is right on the corner; there's a chain link fence and signage.  Easy way to get to the trail is to ride the ladder bridge to the right and stay high on the hill.",
