    "description": "This is an approved snowshoe for the Cypress Bowl area from the downhill parking lot. You need a backcountry pass which is available at the start just behind the rental shop.\r\nThis trail starts just left of the Eagle Chair approx 50 yds up the ski run. It is well marked with poles. The hike goes up to Bowen Lookout with a good elevation change which is fun in new snow. The official hike ends at the Howe Sound Crest trail but we headed up towards Strachan Meadows. Although the Howe Sound trail didn't have marking poles, it is well used and easy to follow. We got close to Strachan Meadows.\r\nIn total, about 4.0 hours of hiking time.\r",
