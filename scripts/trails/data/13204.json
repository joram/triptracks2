    "description": "I don?t remember what prompted me to explore this valley for a waterfall.  I had a point in my gps and enough time to get there and come back.  The start was not fun as I tried to go over to a small valley to get down to the main brook.  The area had been logged and brush was prickly and waist high.  Eventually I found the small valley and followed a small brook.  It has a quasi fall covered by green moss.  Once on Harris Brook, I followed it downstream and to my surprise, I found a very nice three tier fall in a small gorge.  The lowest fall is the highest and there is a very nice pool above it.  If you bring some rope you should be able to downclimb and swim in it?your private pool in the wilderness!  Falls are at  N46.15137\u00b0 W60.85211\u00b0.  To get back to my car, I followed another small brook uphill.Stats for the hike; 2.9km, 1hr, 1180ft total elevation",
