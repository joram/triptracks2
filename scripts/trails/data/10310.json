    "description": "The North Star Rail trail connects Kimberly to Cranbrook via a paved pathway.The ?Rails to Trails? development is a joint project between the City of Kimberley and the City of Cranbrook to create a commuter and recreation trail between Cranbrook and Kimberley. The abandoned CP railway track between Kimberley and Cranbrook has been removed and converted into a 40km greenway that provides access to both communities.It's an easy and pleasant ride with some decent scenery in places.",
    "directions": "The city of Cranbrook is in the process of extending the trail in various places. The start of the 25 is at end of Collison Rd, just south of the Junction of highway 95A and Theatre road.As I did find this point GPS data starts about 1.3 from here. In Kimberly trail is through a lane to a gate right near the Civic Centre.There are other access points off Highway 95 A.",
