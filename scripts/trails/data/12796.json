    "description": "A good waterfall to visit in Guysborough is located on a tributary south of the Salmon River which is accessible via an ATV trail.  .  You can access the ATV trail via a footbridge located to the west of this brook.  I chose to wear my waders and cross the Salmon River in front of the stream I wanted to follow.  After crossing the Salmon River, I hooked up to the ATV trail and kept going uphill for a few minutes.  Towards the top, you have a great view of the area to the north.  A secondary branch of the ATV trail leads into a mature deciduous forest and a hunting camp.  Just below the hunting camp is a small ravine with a beautiful 20ft waterfall.",
    "directions": "Take the south River Lake Rd.  At the intersection of the Tompkinsville Rd you will be in front of the three Pond Brook located across the salmon River to the south of you).
