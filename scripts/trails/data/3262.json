    "description": "Winding maze of several trails that are colour coded but are somewhat difficult to follow.  Trails intersect and you'll find yourself getting lost or going in circles - bring your GPS.The trails themselves are quite good with some challenging climbs and fast descents.  The highlights are a number of ramps & bridges on the west side of the trail.  This section is for advanced riders only.",
    "directions": "Take Hwy #6 north to Clappison's Corners where #6 meets #5. (Dundas street) Head east on Dundas until you hit Howland Mills Drive or your right.   Take Howland Mills to Grindstone Way and turn right.  Follow Grindstone Way around (circle) until you see a pathway between houses - there are 2 of them.  Both paths will take you to the trails.",
