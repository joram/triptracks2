    "description": "This trail branches off from the popular Lake Agnes/Little Beehive trail. This trail seems to be missing from most of the maps I've checked. But the trail is distinct. Once you leave the Little Beehive trail, the path is uncrowded and the views become more impressive.",
    "directions": "From the Lake Louise Parking lot follow the signs for Lake Agnes",
