    "description": "T-Dub is a fairly serious downhill (DH) trail accessed via Moose Mountain road just 14km West of Bragg Creek.  Brought to you by the fine (and HARD WORKING) folks at MMBTS (Moose Mountain Bike Trails Society), T-Dub has some serious, life threatning terrain.  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.\nStarting from the top of Moose Mountain road and finishing a couple km up the (closed to cars) Shell Moose Mountain plant road (aka Canyon Creek Road).  From the bottom of T-Dub, turn left and follow the gravel road 3km down to Ing's Mine trailhead / parking lot.\nXC riders can tie T-Dub in to some combination of a ride up Pneuma / Sulphur Springs / Moosepackers to the upper parking lot.  They can also ride down the road to Hiway 66, go 800m East, then ride back to Moose Road or Station Flats on the very mild Riverview trail.",
    "directions": "From Bragg Creek, head South to Hiway 66.  Drive West ~14 km - 2km PAST Station Flats.  Turn right up the gravel Moose Mountain Road, stop at the top gate and look just past the gate on your left for the start.",
