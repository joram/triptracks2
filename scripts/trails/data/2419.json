A suitable walk for the fit family.\r\n\r\nBeautiful views of the lake and lovely mountain surroundings.\r\n\r\nApparently there are line-ups for the parking lot in the summer so pick when you go.\r\n\r\nA lovely gem.",
    "directions": "Drive to Anmore BC and follow the signs to the Buntzen Lake Resevoir, it's well posted.  Park at in the 3rd South Beach parking lot and access the trail from the South West corner of the parking lot, by the signs and rubbish bins.",
