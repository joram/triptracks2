    "description": "This is a cool little destination in Londonderry.  Londonderry was once a bustling town and had the second highest production of iron in North America.   This means there are lots of remnants to explore around there.  One of the coolest one is a series of old coke ovens lined up in the forest mere feet from a well travelled road. Go to the coke ovens and then walk towards the river to see the huge slag piles that are left from that industrial area.",
    "directions": "Park at intersection of Base Line Rd and Broadway street.  On north side of Base Line rd, there is an atv path.  Take it and within a few metres go totally east.  Within a few ten of metres, the slopes goes up and the coke ovens are lined up right there around ( 45\u00b028'37.92\"N,  63\u00b036'4.87\"W).  Once you have done this part hike to  45\u00b028'41.41\"N,  63\u00b036'28.40\"W to see the slag piles",
