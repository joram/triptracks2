    "description": "NTS Map:92F8.  This is a pleasant hike through the woods, skirting the Englishman River for most of its length. After about half a km. you arrive at the top of some bluffs overlooking the river. Quite soon after you will get to a log crossing Morrison creek that last year has been converted into a easily crossable bridge. You than walk under a vary nice alder grove and than some very old douglas firs and the largest pine tree I know of. After you stumble over some trenches dug to keep cars out of private property, and scramble down a steep gravel hill you get to a large spawning pond. A little while later you get to the main hatchery building and you have the choice of going left along the main trail to the beaver pond, turning right to go on the riding trail along side the river. If you go left you will quickly be rewarded by an abundance of wildlife including great horned owls, bald eagles, great blue herons, American Dippers, beavers and if you're lucky a black bear in the fall!",
    "directions": "Traveling north from Nanaimo on the inland island highway turn left onto the Port Alberni highway, than make another left on to Errington Road. Turn left on Englishman River Road just before you get to Englishman River Falls Provincial Park (another nice hike) drive to the end and park in a small turnabout. The trailhead is not marked, but clearly visible.",
