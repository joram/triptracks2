    "description": "This new school freerider has a ton of larger jumps and gaps. For you more earthbound riders, there's plenty of ride-arounds and the natural berms and gully features make this one a worthwhile ride.  Especially if you bring along some huckers to liven things up a bit.However, there's lots of ride-arounds for you non-jumpers in the crowd, and the natural berms and gullies on this trail make it a joy to hit over and over. Plus, you'll probably end up jumping stuff you never thought you would.",
    "directions": "This trail is best done as a shuttle.Leave your drop vehicle at the Lost Loon just south of twon on Hwy 97 (a pub at the bottom, how conveeeeeenient).Access the top off of  Fox Mtn Rd.  At the top of the hill, turn right on Ross Rd and right again on Palomino Rd.  The trail head is at the end of Palomono Rd.  By early 2008, there should be a new entrance at the corner of Ross and Fox Mtn Rds.",
