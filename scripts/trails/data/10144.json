    "description": "Easy trail. Very nice in the heat of summer as this trail follows a canyon and is very well shaded. \r\rThe trail starts in the open but soon canyons under some pine and other trees. It is fairly typical Oliver desert in the first 3/4 but transitions to some greener sections in the end.",
    "directions": "Leave Oliver towards the Mt Baldy Ski area. Approximately 3.2 km's past the gas station take a dirt road to the right through an open desert section. There is one small stream to cross but it is generally dry in the summer. Travel this road for 2.5 km to the trailhead. This section can be included in the hike.",
