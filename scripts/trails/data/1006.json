    "description": "The trail passes by two small lakes before heading up a steep slope to the lookout.  From there you can view Rock Lake and the surrounding area.  A wooden staircase leads you back down to lake level, where you can choose to head back to the trailhead via a former railway or take an additional side trail (0.5km approx) to the remains of the Barclay Estate which was occupied until 1953.",
    "directions": "From Huntsville, take Highway 60 east into Algonquin Park.  The Rock Lake Campground entrance is 40.3 from the main gate on the right-hand side.  The campground itself is another 8km along a gravel road.  The trailhead is located at the far end of the campground",
