    "description": "NTS Map: 082N09Elevation Gain: 155 m (510 ft), all at the end. Distance is 9km return. The Bow Glacier Falls Trail in Banff National Park.leads you up a narrow gorge, which is treacherous when wet or snow covered, and onto the crest of a glacial moraine.From here, pick your way across 800 metres of outwash to the base of Bow Glacier Falls, headwaters of the Bow River. This is a great place for a picnic on a hot summer day.Note: this is a short day hike, therefore provision yourself appropriately. There is a modest climb of 155m required in the 4.6-km hike (near the end).",
    "directions": "The trailhead is found at km. 37 on the Icefields Parkway (Highway 93 north from Lake Louise). From the parking lot at historic  Num-Ti-Jah Lodge, follow the trail past along the lakeshore and over the outwash flats at the back of the lake.",
