    "description": "This hike, located close to Amherst, brings you to a nice hidden waterfall.  The first part of the hike is through some blueberry fields which are gorgeous in autumn with vibrant colors.  Enter the woods and you are immediately faced with a depp ravine from which you can hear the roar of the fall.  Ok maybe not a roar at the time I was there but you candefinitely hear it!  Carefully make your way down the steep slopes and move upstream to the 30ft waterfall sitting at the end of the ravine.",
