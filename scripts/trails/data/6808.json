    "description": "Port Khusam is a ghost town located near Sayward and Kelsey Bay. I'm not sure when it was abandoned. There is a large building and several smaller houses including some old machinery. The trail goes up over the hill and back down. Great views of Hardwicke Island!",
    "directions": "Turn off of Highway 19 onto Cemetary Road (the Sayward exit) and then turn onto Port Khusam Trail after a few kilometres. Park at the end, the trail should be obvious.",
