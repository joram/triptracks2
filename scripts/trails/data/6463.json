    "description": "Easy trail through the wilderness around Mt MacDonald.  The challenge is  to find the trail head.  Someone built a house on the original trail head blocking access.  Without passing any signs, you will eventually  find yourself on the inside of a water reserve fence(just walk around it)  and  the inside of the park fence (just walk through it at the opening in the  gate)",
    "directions": "Park on Sooke Rd about 200m past Humpback Road.\nBush-wack about 200m to 48 deg 25.636' and  123  deg 34.236.",
