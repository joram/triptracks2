    "description": "NTS Map: 082J15Elevation Gain: 60 m\r\nThis is a pleasant loop ride starting and finishing at Allen Bill Pond. Head east along Elbow River, and follow the signs. Go through the gate at kilometer 0.9 and take right fork at kilometer 1.1.  From here just follow the trail. The highest point is at the gate at kilometer 6.3.  Then keep going to the short junction trail from kilometer 7.2 (turn left) to kilometer 7.6 (turn left again). From here Elbow Trail runs roughly parallel to the outward route.\r\nThe whole ride is in low foothills, so the only (limited) view is at the high point gate. \r\nThe ride can be muddy after rain, but is still rideable unless it's been really wet!  Watch for animal tracks, mostly cow and horse, and occasionally dogs, (lots of tire creatures).  I have seen bear tracks. There is GPS data attached to this trail (see \"download GPS\"), which if loaded into your GPS can help you find route points.",
    "directions": "Head west from Calgary to Bragg Creek. Go south and then west on Highway 66 a little over 10 km to the signposted Allen Bill Pond car park.",
