    "description": "I used Monroe Trail to peakbag Camels Hump which is located at East side of mountain. Trail is dried and not muddy despite of rainning in past a couple of days.  It starts with gradual ascent, but, eventually the trail becomes steep and it includes some rocky sections as well.\r\rThe total mileage of this hike is 6.8 miles for round trip.  1800 ft elevation gain. Book time is 4 hours.",
    "directions": "From Junesville Post Office on Rt 2, take South on Duxbury Road.  This road becomes River Road, then, take right turn on Ridley Brook and Camels Hump road.  At the end of this road, there are 2-3 parking lots.  Trail starts from one of Parking Lot.",
