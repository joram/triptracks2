    "description": "A short hike on a non maintained old logging road leads you to a surprisingly good size waterfall on Plaster Cove in Port Hastings.  From the TCH, I made aline for an area towards the fall and immediately was pleasantly surprised to see a sign indicating this way to a waterfall.  I followed this old track and made my way across two different smaller brooks.  then the trail started to go up into the forest and at some point, I lost the trail but could hear the fall on my right hand side.  I pushed through about 20m of wood and made my way down a muddy slope to be at the base of the fall.",
