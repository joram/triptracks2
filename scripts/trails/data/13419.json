    "description": "This is one of those roadside falls.  The fall is well hidden so it is possible to drive by without seing it.  From the road, take the knife's edge overlooking the downstream part of the stream and follow it as it overlooks the small gorge.  If the water is not tooo high, you can enter the gorge and stand at the foot of the second waterfall of about 15ft.  Total distance to walk is only about 100m",
    "directions": "Take the Bourinot Road and park at the metal guard rail by MacLeaod Brook (look at the gps track in the post)",
