    "description": "A nice 40 foot waterfall on a small unassuming brook.Setting off on a logging road, you soon have to cut across a vast expanse of recently cut hardwoods.  The raspberry and other prickly bushed will make you regret wearing shorts.  After about 500m of this you enter the forest on the edge of the ravine created by the brook.You soon hear the roar of the waterfalls and then you get to an area where there are large rocky outcrops on either side of the brook.  The brook plunges down the valley at this point creating some very nice waterfalls.  Caution lots of loose boulder rocks with small holes perfectly placed to break your ankle!",
