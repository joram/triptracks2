    "description": "*** Annual road closure (AB-546) between December 1 & May 14.Completed on MAY 20, 2017. Some snow on the ridge but less than a foot steep and beautiful easy shoulder season hike.Edwards Rating: N/A - Hike1.5 to 3.5 hoursElevation of 352 m NET, 408 m TOT & max 1935 m*****We decided to do an easy hike ahead of a long day tomorrow and it was the perfect one for that. We were not expecting to enjoy it particularly but it ended up being a very nice hike.From the road, we hiked up the grassy slope and reached the rocky section of the ridge using the chimney to go up on the beginning of a beautiful cliff. We saw a trail and followed it to the left along that cliff. We lost the trail a few times as it was snow covered sometimes but bushwhacking was easy anyways and faint trails everywhere allowed us to keep going up NNE towards the summit. We turned left at GR654156 but then we went back up NNE (right) while the summit was on the west side of the ridge. We walk back to our left losing a bit of elevation and then back up to a nice summit with a wide plateau to enjoy the views of Bluerock Mountain, Mount Rose and Threepoint Mountain further up north. We saw small bear tracks up to the summit. While in the car driving back down George Creek Road, a photographer draw our attention on the south slope where a black bear was walking in the forest.",

Turn right on George Creek Road (dirt road) and keep going for about 1.2 km. We parked on the left side of the road at GR651135 in front of a steep grassy slope (SSE end of Missinglink Mnt).",
