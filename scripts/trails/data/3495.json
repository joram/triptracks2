    "description": "Great snowshoe up to Rummel Lake, about 400m of elevation gain.  A really nice, varied trail, crossing some lightly treed hill tops, winding through the Black Forest (I just made up that designation but it is fitting), across a couple minor streams (bridged), over a hill and down into a scenic lake.We were up on a very snowy day so I can't swear to the scenicity, but I felt good vibes.   I am also told there are many scenic views of the Spray valley and of Spray Lake.The snow was really nice, but take a step 1/2 meter off of the trail and you're up to your 'nads in snow, even wearing the big, baddest, Atlas 1030 Snowshoes.  This meant lotsa frolicking on the way down (and a couple great fluffy face plants).Investigate Mount Engadine Lodge for accommodations or noshments, you won't be sorry.NOTE:  After adding the trail, I just looked at the map data in the Google Maps preview and notice we walked through some obvious cut blocks.  I say obvious only because I can see the aerial view.  Walking through them on the ground (in the winter) I thought it was just not a lot of trees.  What I'm trying to say is don't let the satellite pictures scare you.",
    "directions": "Travel along The Spray Lakes Road (SLR), either North from Peter Lougheed Provincial Park or South past the Canmore Nordic Center.  The trailhead is on the East side of the road directly across from the Mount Shark road.  You can park on the side of SLR or on the Mt. Shark road.",
