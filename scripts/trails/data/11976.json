    "description": "The South Summit of Mount Baldy offers spectacular views of the Kananaskis Valley. Although usually accessed by traversing the somewhat technical scramble from the North Summit, this peak can also be achieved without any of the exposure as a there and back hike. The trail starts out as an enjoyable forest hike but soon turns into a steep, never ending scree climb to the col between the West and South Peaks. What seems to take hours to get up will only take minutes to get back down. The final accent is made from the col (more scree). The summit is marked by a very large cairn. Elevation gain: 807 m",
    "directions": "The trailhead is next to a stream on the east side of Kananaskis Trail (Hwy # 40), about 13km south of the Trans-Canada Highway (Hwy # 1) between Barrier Lake Picnic Area and the wishing-well. Stay right when the trail splits, the left goes to the very popular North Peak.",
