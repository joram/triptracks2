    "description": "Easy walk from the Trout Creek Bridge to a look out point with 360 views of Summerland and Trout Creek Canyon, and surrounding  mountains. Most of this trail follows an old unused forestry rd. The last few hundred meters is single track and fairly steep. There are some cliffs near the summit so if you take your dog be sure to take a leash. Great views. Trail is about 10 km round trip.",
    "directions": "Highway 97 to Summerland. Follow signs to Summerland Sweets on Canyon view rd. Just past the store you'll see the train trestle over Trout Creek. There is parking for about 6 vehicles. You can also park at Summerland Sweets. Great place for an ice cream and other goodies. You cross the trestle to get to the trailhead.",
