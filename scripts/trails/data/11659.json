    "description": "Nice 15.5km trail in the Jacques-Cartier National Park.  Easy uphill for the first 4 km then quite flat along 2 small lakes with Beaver dams.  Astonishing view on the Jacques-Cartier river valley at the end - the best in the park.   7.8km return - total 15.6km.",
    "directions": "HW 75 North for 30-35 km.  Take exit for \"Parc National de la Jacques-Cartier\".  There is a 7.50$ fee at the entrance and you can ask for a map and directions.  The trail head is on the main road, 15km from the entrance.  Camping is possible in the park.",
