    "description": "This is a description of a hiking trail and seperate single track mountain bike trail in the Participark in Kentville.   The hiking trails are two loops that are stacked.  There might be some mtn bikes on it but most mountain bikers will go off to the east of the stacked loops where there are some very interesting single tracks through a conifer forest set in a gorge.  Congrats to the builders here as there are a lot of features for the bikers!   Jumps, drops, rails etc....At the start of the stacked loop there is also a small terrain park with more banked and built-up features.  Lots of fun there too!",
    "directions": "Highway 1 in Kentville. Turn on Glady's Porter and drive to the end where you will see some signange for the gorge.",
