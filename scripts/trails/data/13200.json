    "description": "This is a hike with no trail down a really steep ravine to see a few waterfalls and a narrow gorge on Stewart Brook, a tributary of Margaree river in Cape Breton Island.  I had spotted some intriguing features on sat imagery and decided to check them out.The start is a bit disappointing, as the top of the mountains here have been recently logged.  But as soon as you hit the crest of the ravine, you enter a nice hardwood forest.  The descent is a bit steep even for me!   Carefully make your way down and then follow the stream upstream to a cool gorge with multiple falls.  The problem is that if you cannot get wet, some of the falls remain inaccessible.  The best way to see them all would be to canyoneer to them one after another from the top. I stayed in the gorge or sometimes on the eastern slope.  The western slope is not your friend.  It?s super vertical and doesn?t offer as many places to get down into the ravine.  Best fall in my opinion is around; N46.46471\u00b0 W60.96139\u00b0.Stats of the hike;  4.8km, 1h38min and 1968ft of total elevation",
    "directions": "Take the Pembroke Lake Road in Grand Etang.  Continue to a main intersection at; N46.48182\u00b0 W60.96884\u00b0.  Here turn left and continue on secondary logging road until N46.47513\u00b0 W60.94940\u00b0.  Here turn right and park at N46.47097\u00b0 W60.95344\u00b0.  Follow my gpx track to the gorge",
