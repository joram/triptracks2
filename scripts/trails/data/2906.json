    "description": "Elevation gain: 1109 meters\r\n\r\nThis starts out as a fairly steep trail in the forest up the northwest slope of Viking Mountain to a wet meadow. Cross it to a small lake and then continue to the ridge. Good views of the park and the valley along the open ridges. It is possible to connect with the Sugarbowl Mountain trail to do a loop back to the road. There is a trail junction for this at the second small meadow.\r\n\r\nThere is usually good skiing in the trees, but the ridge is often wind blasted. Check for latest info on the PGBRS discussion  forum.\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrent conditions:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r",
    "directions": "\r\n\r\nFrom Prince George travel east on Highway 16 for approximately 83 km . A small parking area is off the north side of the road. Cross the road and there is a sign on the trail uphill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more info on the area trails, you can buy a copy of the Prince George and District Trail Guide from the Caledonia Ramblers Club, who organize many hikes and ski trips annually.",
