    "description": "This is a shortish hike to a couple of waterfalls on a brook in Sunnybrae, Nova Scotia.  There are no trails leading to them so you just follow the brook upstream from the village to a distance of about 1.5km to the biggest fall.  The biggest fall is not very high at about 12 ft but its very scenic as it cascades down over rocky outcrops.   Most of the hike is done on the stream's edge with a few times where you can cut across some woodlands.",
    "directions": "Highway 348 to Sunnybrae.  Blanchard Brook flows under the highway in the Village of Sunnybrae",
