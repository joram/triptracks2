    "description": "First lesson: Waskatenau is not pronounced Was-KAT-en-ow, it's how the locals tell you're not from around here, boy (that and the fact you're riding a Giant Trance, not a Yamaha quad).\r\n\r\nA reclaimed Rail Trail and 'Linear Park' administered by a consortium of area municipalities and veteran trail builders. Interesting path takes you through a number of towns so you don't even have to pack a tent if you don't want to.  We stayed at hotels in Smoky Lake, Spedden ( 8/ ) and St.Paul over our 4 day trip of this and other sections.\r\n\r\nNor do you have to do it all. The handy proximity to towns means you can do whatever section(s) you want. \r\n\r\nThe entire trail is described in more detail in 5 other trailpeak entries, \"Search Trails\" and type in Iron Horse to find the 5 listings. Refer to the individual sections for detailed GPS logs.\r\nNice looking trail in surprisingly scenic countryside. Sure it's flat(ish) but really, really pretty countryside. You will be pleasantly surprised if you don't just HAVE to have singletrack and steep grinds to ride up & down. \r\n\r\nVilna has a great historic downtown with period babershop & pool hall.\r\n\r\nAn in-depth website covers most aspects of the trail, please see http://ironhorsetrail.ca/ for more info. \r\n\r\nThis trail is in the general area of:\r",
    "directions": "You can pick it up just about anywhere along it's length, Waskatenau in the West, Cold Lake in the NE, Heinsburg/Elk Point in the SE, St.Paul, Vilna, etc. \r\n\r\nVilna, Ashmont, Spedden, Waskatenau, Smoky Lake, Warspite, and more all have staging areas with parking.  Some with giant pumpkins.",
