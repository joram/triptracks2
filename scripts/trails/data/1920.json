    "description": "Awesome Trail All Around!!\nNot A Lot Of Stunts, Only A Few Skinnys. Lot's Of Small Drops, Like Roots And Logs. Should Be Able To Lift Front Tire And Know How To Go Of Drops. Not too Difficult. A Challenge For Intermediate Riders, but still Fun For Advanced. If You Are An Intermediate Rider, You Might Have To Walk Through A Few Spots, But Other Than That It's Wicked. Advanced/Experts Should Be Able To Ride The Whole Thing. \nMore Mt Fromme mountain biking trails can be found here.",
    "directions": "IF GETTING DROPPED OFF:\nGet Dropped Off At The Drop Off Spot At The Base Of Fromme Mountain. Will Have To Walk Or Ride Up A Bit Of A Hill, But No Cars Beyond That Point. When Riding/Walking Up Look For A Large Opening On Your Right Hand Side. There May Be A Few Before, But Ride/Walk Past Those (But Those Do Lead Onto Griffin, You Just Miss The Best Part). Turn Right At The Big Opening And Ride Down A Steepish Hill And Take The Next Right!!\nIF PARKING:\nNot Applicable.",
