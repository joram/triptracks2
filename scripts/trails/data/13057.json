    "description": "From Bedwell Lake follow the trail past the pit toilet, this will lead you in the right direction. As you make your way along the trail you will be gaining elevation, not a severe gain but a gain none the less. After a little while you will come up to a waterfall, make your way up the water fall on the left of it. You have now reached Big Jim Lake. Head around the left of the lake and head towards to the other side. Once you reach the other side and head up, you will see Mt. Septimus looming in the distance. That is your bearing and head towards it. After a while you will come to a high point overlooking Cream Lake, you can either stay here and enjoy the view or head down and camp at Cream Lake.",
