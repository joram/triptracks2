    "description": "An AMAZING technical, loose, downhill run.  We shuttled this, I have to sadly admit.  The weather was iffy and 20km and 800m along a gravel road in the trees just isn't that much fun.  I'm sorry, but it isn't.  So we drove to an upper trailhead.\nKarma got us back though as we took a wrong turn (stay North, not NW at the BranchNORTH waypoint).  We did see it connects up with other trails at the bottom and it added a nice technical ride with ~2km and 150 m each way.\nWe still got in over 22km and 800+ meters of sweet descending.  The altitude plot of the attached tracklog is a little iffy as is the last 2 km or so, it was a fast ride through a heavily treed canyon.  Rest assured, it easy to follow the trail, there is only one in that area.\nThere was so much downhill here that I stopped to take some pictures and set my bike down.  It happened to lean against some leaves that had water drops on them from the rain we were sporadically encountering and they actually started to sizzle against my brake rotor.\nThe attached GPS file has the road route to the trailheads as well so you can find your way up there.",
    "directions": "Hiway 93 N/W to Twin Bridges to \"Farm To Market\" road to Tally Lake Road (NF 113) towards Tally Lake Campground (where you come out at).  Lowest trailhead is 4.0km before the campground and is just a small, but signed, singletrack heading up to the S from the road.  Alternately go back another 3km and take Mountain Meadows Road then NF-2956 for a total of 17.2km to top trailhead.",
