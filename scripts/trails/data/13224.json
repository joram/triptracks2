    "description": "Quite steep but short, with great views.  In addition to walking the route we followed, you could continue for miles on the ridge.  We couldn't do that because of too much snow, but late in the summer it could easily be done.",
    "directions": "This trail begins after driving up the Cooper Dam dirt road, which takes off to the south from the Sterling highway at about milepost 49.5 (just to the west of a small road on the north called Little Jim Circle). You drive the dirt road about two miles up to a gate. Then walk 200 paces past the gate and you will see the little trail starting on your left. The views from the top of the mountain are worth the climb.",
