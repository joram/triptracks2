    "description": "Completed on October 1, 2017 and snow covered on the way down (?blizzard?)Edwards Rating: II (IV) S S5 to 8 hoursElevation of 698 m NET, 757 m TOT & max 2227 m (South summit, north at 2207 m)Gear: Poles (every hike), helmet (every scramble), GPS device and/or compass (very useful here) and microspikes if snow covered.*****This is not the kind of scramble to attempt if you need a trail. This involves route finding, terrible bushwhacking at times and difficult and exposed scrambling on the south summit block. Most parties reached the south summit from the south ridge starting on the now closed Fortress Rd. For some reasons we really liked it despite all this bushwhacking. The last section should be completed when dry but I got caught in a blizzard on the way down so it was trickier. We should have RETURNED THE SAME WAY but we tried going down the ridge all the way to the creek as we had some GPS track from an App but it led us nowhere and there were many cliffs to circumvent with frustrating bushwhacking.We used the Galatea Lakes trail crossing the first three bridges. There?s some sort of canyon between bridges 3 and 4 with a small trail on the left side of the canyon (GR275360). We started following that trail for a few metres and went up a rock band to get to the forest. We followed a very good trail from there going along that canyon between Spoon Needle and Fortress Ridge. We relied on our GPS and the beautiful Mount Kidd South behind us to stay on track and when we saw on the satellite map that the ridge on our left seemed opened we just cut to the left and bushwhacked our way up a steep slope (GR273354). We continued until we got to that rocky ridge (GR274354) and then our route became obvious. We followed the ridge using games of trails and reached the north summit quickly (GR278345). It started snowing at some point but no accumulation yet so we kept going to the south (true) summit on a sometimes-exposed ridge. When we got very close to the summit block, we didn?t want to try scrambling the last section of the ridge as it was deadly exposed on both sides and looked more like a climb at that point. We went down a wide ledge on the left and got too far, trying to find the best way to make it to the summit with ?safe? but exposed climbing. We came back a few steps and saw a weakness (GR279342) where only a couple of climbing moves were necessary to get to the next ledge above us but with some unstable rocks. My partner waited for me at the crux while I reached that narrower ledge. I turned left staying close to the wall, traversing some sort of gully and going up a rubble slope to reach the true summit (GR279343) on my left. None of that was easy nor obvious as they are no trail or cairns. On the way down, I added 5 cairns between the summit and the crux in case someone else would like to give it a try. The way down was scary as the blizzard hit us when I left the summit but the snow accumulation started only once we were on safer grounds. Again, we should have descended the exact same way to minimize bushwhacking as our descent route was terrible.",
