    "description": "This trail is seldom used because the trail head is hard to find without directions (see below). But the rewards for coming here are amazing views of the surrounding area at different viewpoints along the trail.\nRecommend direction for the loop is clockwise. The first half is a good climb but nothing too strenuous. Recommended viewpoints are at N 49\u00b0 23.009 W 121\u00b0 27.950, N 49\u00b0 22.850 W 121\u00b0 27.947, and  N 49\u00b0 22.890 W 121\u00b0 28.024. The trail is fairly well marked with flagging tape.",
    "directions": "The trail head is at the west end of the weigh station area behind boulders - N 49\u00b0 23.095 W 121\u00b0 28.429. Cross the railroad tracks and look for flagging tape at a large cement block to your left. Very shortly you'll come to a junction. The left fork (recommended) will take you clockwise around the ridge and return to this spot.\nUpdate re the mention of ticks below: We have 2 large dogs and check them for ticks after hikes. We've never found any on them any time we've used this trail during different times of the year.",
