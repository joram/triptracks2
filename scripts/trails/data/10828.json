    "description": "The trail here is similar to other Colorado Trail sections in the area, though the first 3 miles or so are heavily used by horses and the tread is sandy and broken up in places. Ride on the Colorado Trail, mostly downhill for about the first 5 miles. At the second road crossing, turn left (FS Road 543) then take a quick left onto FS Road 550. Go about a half mile and turn right onto Gashouse Trail. Take this up on singletrack and continue to Miller Gulch trail. Turn left onto Miller Gulch trail, go through the gate at the top of the hill and turn right onto FS Road 553. Follow this down and make a left onto FS Road 549, then continue left onto FS Road 553. Go up the second road on the right, through the gate back to the intersection w/ Colorado Trail. Go right and climb about 2.5 miles back to the trailhead. We did the loop backwards, it's pretty easy to get lost out here with all the roads and trails. Pretty good trail but we got stuck riding the trail at the same time as some horseback riders. Still a good workout and some nice singletrack in the woods.",
    "directions": "From Colorado Springs, take US 24 to Woodland Park. Turn right onto CO 67 and go to Deckers. Continue straight onto CO 126 approximately 15 miles. Turn left onto FS Road 550. Go about 10 miles, turn left onto FS Road 543 (Wellington Lake Rd.). Parking is on the right at Colorado Trail sign.",
