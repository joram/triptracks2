    "description": "The Amphitheatre is a very pleasant destination in itself. Plenty of flowers in the meadow. Sheep are often seen on the slopes above.Pika are very active in the talus. Be prepared for bear too (there were fresh tracks in the snow yesterday).Those who want to scramble up to the peak should be ready for a challenging scramble.",
    "directions": "Follow road to Mt. Norquay ski resort and follow signs.Walk through base area, trailhead is ~70m past Mystic Express (high speed quad chair furthest from base) and keep going straight (roughly NNW / N). In about 2.6 km, trail will start up some switchbacks heading East. You might want to download this GPS track, to at least facilitate getting through the Mount Norquay ski area!",
