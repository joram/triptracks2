    "description": "The hydro cut is a main trail following the power lines, with numerous single tracks leading off of it.  Many of the single tracks are extremely well developed and flow really well.  Goes all the way past St. Agatha, but best riding is until St Agatha. Follow the Hydro Lines and branch off, all single track, and eventually loop back to hydro lines. Some north shore style trails are hidden away in here. Look for them on the north side of the cut. The best riding in the waterloo area I've found.  The bike traffic has diminished since the obstacle tear-down, but some new single-track trails are being developed. Look for signs for \"Frankenstein\"; great tight switchbacks and tight technical short downhill sections. great tree cover for when the summer gets hot.",
    "directions": "If you enter from the Highland Road route (past Trussler Rd, right at yellow barn/gravel pit entrance) there is a sign stating that at least that section of the forest is an \"Agreement Forest\", therefore crown land.",
