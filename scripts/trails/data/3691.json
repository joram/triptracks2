    "description": "This is a newly acquired conservation area with no formal access. Some informal trails have been laid out by volunteers. The trail is close to Boyd's Creek in bush and open Shield terrain. It adjoins private land with an owner who is determined to keep everyone off, so stay away from the eastern edge.",
    "directions": "Highway 11 N from Orillia to Cooper's Falls Road. East two km to Riverdale Drive to end. Trail head is about 50 meters from the end of the road on the north side (the side with no houses).",
