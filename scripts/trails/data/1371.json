    "description": "This a moderately difficult trail along the banks of Galatea Creek arriving eventually at Lillian Lake (also campsites). Along with a suspension bridge over the Kananaskis River there are 10 other bridge crossings (kids love bridges). There is one steeper portion but it is quite short in length.Option - this trail intersects the Terrace Trail  after crossing the second bridge. The Terrace Trail runs from this trail to Kananaskis Village. The length of 6.5km is one way.This is a very popular trail, especially on weekends, so arrive early or on weekdays. For a little solitude on weekends, travel a little further (1km and 183m elev.)to the Galatea Lakes. The unofficial trail begins behind campsite #11.",
    "directions": "The trailhead is well signed, right on Hwy 40, about 3 miles south of the Kananaskis Golf Courses.",
