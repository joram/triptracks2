    "description": "This is probably one of the easiest views on the island. Trails circle around the top of the Mountain (yes it is classified as a Mountain) and at the bottom. The bottom trails are mostly access to the bottom of the face, nothing really to great down there (just lots of junk and mud). You can drive to the top hop out of your car and enjoy the views. You can also park at the bottom and walk up the road. (30 min at a leisurely pace) Once up there it is easy to check out some great views. A good one to do with the family.",
    "directions": "Take exit 51 off the highway. Go towards Coombs/Errington, L on Bellevue, 2nd road on the L is Little Mountain Rd. (For bottom trails stay straight on Bellevue until the end of the road.",
