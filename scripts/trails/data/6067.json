    "description": "A beautiful trail with a little bit of eveything. Waterfalls, trees, rock, streams, a little scrambling and panoramic views of the Ottawa valley. The first part of the hike is a bit of a workout, traversing the Eardley Escarpment, but it levels off a bit at the edge of the escarpment with a gentle upward slope to the firetower. The total elevation gain is about 1100 feet. I like it in the spring the best when the crowds are few and there is till a bit of snow on the ground when you reach the top of the escarpment.",
    "directions": "From Ottawa take Champlian Bridge to Route 148. Befroe arriving at Lusk take a right at the NCC sign for a few hundred meters and then a left to the parking lot. There are washrooms and a picnic area at the parking lot.",
