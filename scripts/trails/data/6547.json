    "description": "Great loop trail through two canyons in North Vancouver.   Great rain forest walk with great canyon and waterfall views.\nFrom the parking lot for Lynn Canyon Ecological centre cross the swinging bridge and take the left fork.  Follow Lynn creek for a while, take the stars out of the canyon and  take the left fork North.  Cross the road and continue on homestead trail down to Seymour River.  There is a \nhistorical site along the river. Follow the river down on an easy trail, cross twin bridge (just one bridge now).  Take the Boden Powell trail up and back down into Lynn canyon.  Go upstream passing by some great water falls and canyons, back to the swinging bridge.",
