    "description": "NTS Map: 082G08Elevation Gain: 700 m (2,297 ft).The trail up Table Mountain is steep in places with scree and not always well marked, but the view in the end is more than worth the pain. \r\nFantastic views to both east and west. You can see the wind mills to the east around Pincher creek\r\n\r\nIt starts easy, but you are going about 700 meters in 5km. You can follow a creek at least part of way up.\r\n\r\nIt can be extremely cold and windy on top.",
    "directions": "From Highway 3 turn south on route 507 (east of Burmis), to Beaver Mines. At Beaver Mines continue south on 774 to Beaver Mines Lake access (also scout camp access). From the Beaver Mines lake Campground you can find the trail head sign. Distance is 5km one way.",
