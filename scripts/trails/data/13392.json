    "description": "The so called Devils Hills Falls are a series of fall near Catalone that are super easy to visit.  Because of that, you may not find yourself on your own but it is still worth the trip.   The tallest fall is about 20ft with some smaller upstream and downstream of it.  From a well travelled dirt road, find the sign indicating the fall.   Walk up the ATV path for about 300m.  To the left are the main falls set just downstream of a large bridge.",
    "directions": "Highway 22 to Catalone.  After Crossing Catalone River, turn on New Boston Road.  Drive and park at the signs indicating the falls.",
