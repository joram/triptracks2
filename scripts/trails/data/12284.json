    "description": "This is an easy day hike that will take you a few hours and leaves right from the Jasper townsite.  The trail starts at a parking lot just off Cabin Creek Drive.  When I did the trail on April 23, 2016 the trail was closed at Cabin Lake due to dam construction.  You can skirt around the construction without too much trouble.  There were several downed trees across the trail as trail maintenance hasn't been completed for the summer.  This is part of a larger well known loop that is 20 miles long.  There are 3 established tent pads at the site and some fire pits with supplied firewood.",
    "directions": "52 52.293 118 06.058 . Head north west from the parking lot.",
