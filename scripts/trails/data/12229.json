    "description": "This is a classic Wind River Range route.  The cirque can be crowded (it was not when we were there), but the rest of the hike is empty.  The elevation hovers around 11,000 feet, so the air can be thin and cold.  We had snow two days and kept the down parkas on all day some days.",
    "directions": "The route is convoluted, and mapping out a GPS track is a good idea.  WE entered from the Big Sandy trail head which is SW of Pinedale WY",
