    "description": "A shorty but a goody.  Not far from the TCH lies a beautiful waterfall actively carving sinuous passages through hard rocks in the hills near Port Hawkesbury.  This hike is really short in the summer as you can drive most of the way to see the fall.  Unless you are worried about bottoming out your car then walk from the TCH.  Either way, the forest surrounding you is beautiful as the road goes uphill to a secondary branch of the Glen Brook where the 50 ft waterfall is located.  In winter it would be a great cross country trip with all the uphill on the front end of the tip and a nice glide back down at the end.",
    "directions": "TCH on Cape Breton Island, turn on River Denys Rd and follow it up to the fall located by the side of this road approximately at; N45 52.044 W61 16.829",
