    "description": "The new Mt Baldy trail (fall 2013) is a collaborative project between the Columbia Shuswap Regional District Area C Parks Commission, the Sorrento and Area Community Association, and the Shuswap Trail Alliance. It?s an intermediate walk (2.8 kms uphill) through mixed forests to a great little lookout over the lake. An even newer 1.8 km optional upper loop was just blazed (Summer 2014) and brushed for more adventurous and experienced hikers to explore.",
    "directions": "The trailhead starts off the east side of the Cul-de-Sac accross the railway tracks on Elson Road and South Shores Place on the left.",
