    "description": "Elevation gain is about 4000 feet.\r\n\r\nFollow the Sheep Creek trail and after the hoodoos turn right and follow the climbing trail\r\nuphill. The trail is steep and gains the ridge which\r\nleads up across meadows to the summit ridge. Many\r\nsmall flowers dot the meadows on the way up. The views\r\nare great from the top, Kluane lake is directly below\r\nand the Sheep-Bullion plateau is seen to the west\r\nreaching across over 10 km distant.",
    "directions": "Go north on the highway out of Haines Junction. Take your first left after Slims River beside Kluane Lake at the Kluane Park Visitor Center. From the parking lot, follow the road until you find a trail to the right. Take that. You will run in to a fair number of trail junctions...stay right. See the  Sheep Creek Road description.",
