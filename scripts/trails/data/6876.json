    "description": "A very nice trail that has a perfect overlook of Tally Lake (hmm, I wonder why they named it so?) for lunch.  There are 500 ish meters of cumulative climbing over this 15km loop\r\rStart with a 7.2km ride up a disused and gently climbing road that is quiet, packed, and scenic enough to make you forget you're riding a doubletrack.  Look for a singletrack heading off to the left where you begin a little more serious climbing up singletrack for ~2km to the apex.  After a looky see and probably a snack, ride about 2.5km along undulating, rocky, typical mountainy singletrack.  Then you get a couple km of semi-tchnical, loose downhill terrain.  This is a pretty fun run that will take you right back to the parking\r\rThe hardest part was finding the trailhead, there is no signs or even a large parking spot, just an overgrown Y in the road whose one branch ends in a 'Kelly Hump' (mound of dirt across a road to prevent use).  This is where you come out.  Park there and start riding NE up the road for about 1km until a 90 degree left turn so you're riding NW.",
    "directions": "From downtown Whitefish, drive up (N & W) hiway 93to SR 424 - Twin Bridges Road.  SouthWest along TB Road to Farm To Market Road (3.75km).  Turn right on F2M for 1.6km, keep right for a mile, right again onto Twin Lakes Road Township Road 351, then along till you see 351A.  Take that for 1.1km and look for the Y.  There is only one Y and it is pretty obvious.\r\rSeriously, if finding this trailhead isn't enough to make you buy a GPS, I don't know what is.",
