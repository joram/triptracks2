    "description": "This is a beautiful hike to the glacier on Mt Olympus. Trail head says 17.5 mile to Glacier Meadows but that is the campground. Its another 1.2 miles to the lateral glacier. And if you want to do a side trip to the terminal glacier its 1.1 miles. But really if you have to choose absolutely you must go to lateral for a full view. Trail is very well used. No way you can get lost. First 12.4 miles which is also the name of the campground (12.4), its pretty much flat but in a rain forest with moss all over and giant trees. From that point on all the way to the glacier its uphill. I suggest doing a bit of it the first day like i did than camp overnight and left most of my gear to do the rest as a day hike to the glacier. You could make it back on the second day if you are in good shape or just camp one more night along the river. Well worth it and if you have extra days in Olympic National park there is plenty of Day hikes or if you are not too tired another overnight.",
    "directions": "Easy to find. If you come from Vancouver. Head down I5 to Burlington and head west to Whitbey Island. Take the ferry to Port Townsend.(worth checking out) and then west on 101 and down to Forks. After Forks keep heading down 101 and take a left on Hoh rain forest rd. There are signs all over for the hoh rain forest visitor centre.",
