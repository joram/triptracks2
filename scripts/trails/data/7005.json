    "description": "This scramble is really good for hikers who wants to be initiated to what would be considered more of a scramble. It's short, it's steep and has great views of Kananaskis Valley after only 20-30 minutes.Technicality: For hikers and beginner scramblersDifficulty: Moderate, steepnessTrail description: It is an easy trail to follow, obvious most of the time. You will have some trails going on your right, be careful as they will get you into gullies with more exposure. If you think that it's more of a difficult scramble than an easy one, you're on the wrong trail. Go back and find the right path. From the trailhead starting on the left side of Ripple Creek, you always want to be on the right side of the peak, as you will get around the peak to the slope in the back, where you'll get to the col for a final ascent. You gain elevation fast for the first 1.5 km I would say, then it's an horizontal line between the peak and the gullies until you get to that steep slope to the col. Once on the summit, you can walk the ridge, approximately 200 m to add to your hike. You can choose to have no exposure or walk it straight on with some exposure at 2 different places overall.Direction: From Highway 1, it's approximately 46 km down South on Highway 40 in Kananaskis. As soon as you see Grizzly Creek on your left, the small unnamed creek that people call Ripple creek is where you want to make a U-turn and park in the ditch. I simply decided to go up to Hood Creek and made a U-Turn, came back on the side of the road, I couldn't miss Ripple Creek then.",
