    "description": "A nice spot for a swim and a picnic spot close to Bridgewater.  Off the dirt road, enter the conifer forest and you will hear the roar of the lower fall/cascade.   Walk upstream on the path or in the river and you will come up to the next fall where the river turns sharply on a 90 degree angle.",
