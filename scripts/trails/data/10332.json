    "description": "Drop 470m in 3.7km (that's a -12.75% grade for the mathematically challenged).  Kilometers of well formed bermy goodness brought to you by your hard working friends at MMBTS  (Moose Mountain Bike Trail Society).\r\rA relatively new trail out in good 'ole K-Country, SHAFT is a technical downhill, but not too loose with no manditory 'features (jumps), only a few and all with go-arounds for those of us without full armour and extensive health plans.  It is steep, but was quite doable on my full XC (not trail, not all mountain, no DH) bike and I rode the whole thing non-stop, though a few buds had to stop and rest their hands & wrists from haning on to the brakes so much for so long.\r\rSHAFT comes out on Ing's Mine Road (aka Shell Moose Mountain Gas Plant aka Canyon Creek Road).  Ride down the road to a number of options such as parking lot / shuttle / highway / Riverside Trail back to Station Flats voa Sulphur Springs trail.\r\rAt the very bottom, don't cross the creek, but grab another 400m of XC riding through the trees folling a small, unmarked (I think) trail to the left following the North bank of the creek.",
    "directions": "Moose Mountain road - Bragg Creek SW of Calgary, keep going 14.5km West on Hiway 66 to the Moose Mountain road.  Drive up the road to the gate (7.2km).  Ride 260m further up road and look for trail entrance on left (SouthEast) side of road.",
