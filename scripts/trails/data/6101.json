    "description": "This is a wide double track trail along the north border of Kalamalka Provincial Park.  there are a few climbs but no pushing.  The Wall and The Parabola each meet the trail from the south.   It pretty much follows the contours of Rattle Snake Hill.  \r\rThis trail makes a great loop by going up The Wall and down Lookout Trail.  The loop is about 7 km and takes you all around the park.  There are views of Cosens Valley and Bay, Cougar Canyon, and Kalamalka Lake.",
    "directions": "The trail connects the Cosens Bay Gate at the east end of Kalamalka Lake Park to the Red gate on the north west of the park.   In Coldstream, take either Kidson Rd to meet the Red Gate, or Coldstream Creek Road to the Cosens Bay Gate.",
