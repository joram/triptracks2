    "description": "Very close to Banff, likely very busy in Summer.  A couple dozen pic-i-nick benches surround the ponds.  In the winter there is lots of room for a XC ski or snowshoe.  A lap around the lakes (ponds) and/or a starting point for other trails, the trailhead for the Cascade Ponds - Bankhead and Cascade Ponds - Watertower/Johnson Lake are here as well, and both are legal MTB trails.\r\r\rCurrent conditions:\r",
    "directions": "From Calgary, drive West on Hiway 1 until the 1st entrance into Banff/Lake Minnewanka.  Stay to the right (North) then take your first right into the well signed Cascade Ponds parking lot.\r\rFrom Vancouver, drive until you hit Canmore then turn around and follow directions above.",
