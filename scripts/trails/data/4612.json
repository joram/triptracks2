    "description": "Another section of the Kettle valley railway trail. This section runs along the west side of Skaha lake traveling from Penticton to Okanagan falls. Using the KVR you have to return via the same route, to make a loop if you don't mind using roads go around Skaha lake via the east side road. It's a scenic ride. There are some sandy sections that require extra effort. Trail length is one way.Bike shop / rentals: Freedom Bike Shop Accomodations: Summerland Resort",
    "directions": "In Penticton at the Camp Ground south side of highway 97 west of airport. It's actually easier to find in Okanagan Falls. Right beside the bridge over the Okanagan river heading north. Parking nearby at the market.",
