    "description": "This is a really short hike, suitable for anybody. The end result is a magnificent waterfall.  The fall leave the rock fave for about 20ft and then cascades down the rest of the way to a somewhat deep pool.  there is a secondary fall located downstream.  The forest around the falls is mostly mature conifers with a few hardwoods.  The upper fall are deeply shaded and the rock formation around them offers a lot of little hooks and crannies...although too small for you and I to crawl through.",
    "directions": "Little Narrows, take little Narrows Rd to St Columba Rd fall.  At the four corner intersection continue straight on St Columba Rd and up the hill.  You will see a small trail to your right at a 90 degree left turn.",
