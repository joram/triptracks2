    "description": "Take in the lakes for a pleasant day trip, or carry on through to Assiniboine for a great back country trip.Either way, stop to enjoy this amazing view above Howard Douglas Lake, with Citadel Peak ahead (Pass is on left side) and Mount Assiniboine in the distance.Consider this as an easy alternative day trip to the Quartz Hill trip previously described.",
    "directions": "Start at Sunshine Village (just west of Banff)... consider buying a Summer Season's Pass (only $100 for numerous trips from the base parking lot) as there is so much to do up here!",
