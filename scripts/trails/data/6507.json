    "description": "Easy flat walk through pleasant forest.  Especially useful as a bike route to Millstream Lake Rd from Munns Rd. cutting off the big hill.  For the first three trail splits choose the left path.  I've included an  alternate way back for variety.",
    "directions": "The trail head is at the parking lot for Mt. Work(N 48deg31.031'  W123deg29.317') and on the other end at #310 Millstream Lake Rd. (N   48deg31.955' W123deg29.881')",
