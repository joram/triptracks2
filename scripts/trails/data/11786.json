    "description": "This is a trail north of Coquitlam Center area, winding its way up from Walton Elementary school to Ridge park and back down. I use it mainly for trail running activity once a week. The trail stays in the wood most of time, but it does cross David street, which is not a big deal since there's little traffic in this area. The total distance is about 9.5km, with elevation gain of 400m.",
