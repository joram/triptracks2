    "description": "This is a small hiking trail around the small Frog Pond Lake, It's part of the Sir Sanford Flemming park (The Dingle). It's basically a medium-sized city park. You can view ducks in the small lake, and in the evening you might even see one of the resident beavers. It's a great place for young kids and also seniors.",
    "directions": "In Halifax, drive to the Purcells Cove Rd, and travel aprox. 8 klms to the park parking lot just before the Williams Lake Rd.",
