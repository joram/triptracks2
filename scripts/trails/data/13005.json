    "description": "Moose mountain loop for ridge walk lovers.First leg is to follow the gravel road for 5.5 kilometers so a bike is highly recommended and it will make the way back super fast.Once you leave your bike, there are a bunch of trails most of them heading to the ice cave (also described on trailpeak), you can follow them for a bit but don't go too high as the goal is to get to the SW ridge which can be followed without issue and if you don't feel comfortable in some parts there are options to go around.Easy stroll along the ridge enjoying the views and then an easy scramble up to Moose mountain where you'll no longer be alone, back the same way at the beginning before heading to another high point. You can scramble down at the end of it but if you don't feel comfortable you can head towards Moose mountains for 2-3 hundred meters and find a traverse below the summit. From there it's a long ridge walk toward the end of the SE ridge without any issue.To go down you'll want to backtrack for 2-3 hundred meters and then enjoy a mix of scree and bigger rocks. You'll have the option to make a stop at the ice cave (which I didn't do) and then it's a stroll down to where you left your bike and a quick ride back to your car.",
