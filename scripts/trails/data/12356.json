    "description": "I was going to update an entry of the upper fall on the West Moose River and I noticed that I hadn't written it...ever!    So here is a two waterfall that are worth to check out in the same reach of the Wet Moose River way upstream of the large and well known downstream fall.Both are accessed on a secondary logging road.  the more downstream one is accessible by first following a small brook that has a couple of smaller falls and then go upstream on the W Moose River to the fall at N45\u00b0 27' 07.6\" W64\u00b0 12' 45.4\".  This one has a huge pool and you can't go to its base without swimming for it so a great swimming hole for sure!The upstream fall is close to otter Lake and I followed a skidder track to the edge of the river and then made my way upstream to the fall which on the west side is guarded by a small cliffs that runs 299 ft downstream.Gps track is for the upper fall",
