    "description": "This is a nice short hike in the outskirts of Hamilton through some karsty-limestone features.  There are numerous trail on the property and all are color coded so it?s way to find your way around.  There are a couple of crevasse like caves to visit; Potruff, Nexus, Nexus window, as well as some blind valleys and sinks to check out.  Great place for kids as the caves are easily accessible and easy to enter and get out with the help of an adult for the real young ones.  Nothing extreme but good if you have an hour to kill in the area.",
    "directions": "Paramont St to Upper Mount Albion Rd.  There are signs to guide you to the (pay) parking of the eramosa karst conservation area",
