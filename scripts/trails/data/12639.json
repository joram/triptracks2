    "description": "The Vernon Nature Area trails are a total of 5 km through large stands of mature Red Pine, Bur Oak, Aspen, common hardwood forests marshlands and a combination of Cambrian Shield and prairie flatlands.There are two separate locations from which one may view the forest canopies and Lake of the Woods from elevated granite outcrops. The many trails will quaint you with the transition zone between the St. Lawrence-Great Lakes Forest Region, the Boreal Forest Region and the Prairie Grasslands.The Vernon property lies on the very edge of these three diverse vegetation zones. The Lookout Trail not only provides two scenic outlooks from which one can see above the forest canopy and over the vast Lake of the Woods but it also passes through an owl hunting ground, and a tree testing area.The Lookout trail connects with the Fern Trail taking you to the lake front and docking area.",
