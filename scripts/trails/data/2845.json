    "description": "A short trip that runs between the David Thompson Highway and the North Sask. River.  It's a good hike if you are headed back to the city but want one more short hike, or need to stretch your legs.  The trail is easy, with the most difficult part being some \"bouldering\" along the rock embankment down from the road. The trail takes you to windy narrows in the north Saskatchewan where the water back eddys to form a cool whirlpool.",
    "directions": "Park on the north side of the David Thompson highway. There is a pullout, not a parking lot.  Look for the happy face graffitti on the rock to tell you how inconsiderate people are, but that you are in the right place.  Take the 4x4 trail that starts on the east end of the highway guardrail down towards the river. Make your way along the bank, over the big rocks and to a cable car that crosses the river. Head up towards the highway and find a cairn dedicated to the first drivers on the David Thompson Highway. You can venture back the way you came or walk along the road to get back to your car.",
