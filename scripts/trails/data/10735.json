    "description": "This is an ambitious hike. The trail leads upwards at a moderate pace until it crosses Vaux Creek, then launches a brutal climb towards the alpine. After many, many switchbacks, the trail ends at a steep snow slope. Snow crossings can be very dangerous. Exercise caution and consider bringing an ice axe on this trip if you are skilled in its use, or ending your hike at the snow slope if conditions are icy. Once across the snow slope, your uphill labour is nearly at an end, at a high viewpoint overlooking the vast and otherworldly expanse of the Illecillewaet Icefield.",
