    "description": "I was looking for some hikes to do in town and stumbled upon a blog that talked about the mystery walls of Bayers Lake.  Bayers Lake is the last place I want to go...especially on a weekend but I found the courage to go through with it.  Parking at a cul de sac, I spotted a faint trail in the grass leading to some woodlands surrounded by the bihi and the 103.   Soon the trail veered off to the left and a brief ascent brought us to the first wall which is more like a stone structure.  Following some other trails we found the walls.  there are about 2 ft wide, made of rocks, and extend quite a ways in the woods.  The mystery part is that no one knows who built them or what they were for.  It is now a protected area under NS special places act.",
    "directions": "Chain Lake Dr.  turn on Lovett Crt and park at the end near the tall building.",
