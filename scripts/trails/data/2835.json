    "description": "NTS Map: 011I06\r\n\r\nThis is a circuit of interconnected trails constructed at the Brookvale provincial park. It occupies the same area as the nordic ski trails, but only spilling onto these routes occasionally.\r\n\r\nThe trail circuit lacks any formal flagging, but there is lots of infrastructure, and the paths are easily followed when you are on them. I think some or all the paths double as snowshoeing routes on their map. If they don't, they will for me!\r\n\r\nWhat I really like about this system is how sections are named after local riders, or likely events. (broken bike brook, Luke's Lunge) I guess that's the privilage of constructing your own trails!\r\n\r\nThere are the occasional built up \"problems\" or structure-rides and see-saws. It's a half day or better's worth of enjoyment, and worth returning to on a regular basis.\r\n\r\nConsider doing an epic, day-long ride or snowshoe. Extend the circuit by adding CTO and Secret Snake  to the itenary. You can find those in the database.\r\n\r\nJanuary 1st '07, this was home to the new year's day ride and feast. Possibly a first for MTN bike riding on single track, in the first of the year.\r\n\r\nshannon Burt\r\nEast Coast editor\r\n\r",
