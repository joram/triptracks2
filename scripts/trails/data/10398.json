    "description": "Great shortish (10k) loop that can be combined with many others in the area to make a day or weekend out of it.  Has a number of fairly technical areas and a few features, but they can be walked around.  Watch for riders bombing through if you're slow or walking though.\r\rYou can do this at any pace you want, it is a great technical, fun buncha singletrack.  Strongly recommended (as is virtually all of Fernie).",
    "directions": "Head a little South of town, turn right (West) on Mt. Fernie Provincial Park Road.  Park just outside the park gates (where it is free).  Ride through the park about 1km exactly, look for Gorby on left.  Ride up Gorby to the top and down to the right to find Verboten.",
