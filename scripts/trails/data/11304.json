    "description": "A gently rising trail through forest with brief glances of the Fraser River below.  An excellent viewpoint and picnic spot at the end of the trail after 3.5 km.",
    "directions": "From Highway 12 (SE of Lillooet or NW of Lytton), take the Lillooet Airport Road to the East.  Drive 1.8 km to a gradual left hand bend.  Take the second road to the right at the bend.  You can park here or drive up 350 meters.  Look around for the \"Fountain Ridge Trail\" sign in the forest to your right.",
