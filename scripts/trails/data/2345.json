    "description": "The soft taco is a very old and well established trail, I believe it is approximately eight to ten years old.\nThe distance is just under 2 KM and you have a vertical drop of about 100 m.\nThis trail is beautiful with it's old moss covered trees and wild ferns growing all over the forest floor. there is also a nice little creek which runs through the little valley.\nBe warned that the Soft Taco is not for the \"Soft hearted\",  it's not recommended in wet weather due to erosion problems, please respect this. It is extremely steep and has very tight turns with a few places where you can get harshly clothes-lined if you are not careful.",
    "directions": "Leaving Abbotsford head north on Hwy 11 until you come to Clayburn Rd. here you turn right (east) and proceed roughly 3 KM here you cross a small bridge and the road will have a turn to the left before a steep hill this is Straiton Rd go left here.\nGo another 2.5-3 KM and look for a parking spot on your right\n(second one).\nEnjoy your ride!\nGet Off Da Couch",
