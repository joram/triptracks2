    "description": "This is a description of a few small fall to check out on the round Hill River near Annapolis Royal.  This river has enough water to be very scenic but does dry up in summer time. I accessed the river via Mill Rd via highway 1.  Where the road became impassable, I parked and followed the river.  the fist cascade is around ( N44\u00b0 45.444' W65\u00b0 24.243') while other features can be found around; N44\u00b0 44.828' W65\u00b0 24.485' and about 150m above this point.  But these are all cascade type waterfalls.  Upstream of highway 101, a fellow explorer has found a fall at; N44\u00b0 43.340' W65\u00b0 23.364'.",
