    "description": "The Snowshoe Trail at Crawford Lake Conservation Area (Conservation Halton) is open year round.  It is a 1.5 km loop that begins near the furthest parking lot from the main gate.  The trail is mostly flat and travels through open fields and mixed forest.  I have hiked this trail in all seasons, but most recently in January with snowshoes.  The hike took under 1 hour with many stops to take pictures of birds.  An easy hike during any season.  It is very quiet during the winter as there are usually only snowshoers and cross-country skiers on the trail.  Snowshoes can be rented at this site if you don't have your own (no idea what they are like, I have my own).",
    "directions": "Crawford Lake Conservation Area is located on Steeles Avenue at Guelph Line in Campbellville, Ontario. Once past the main gate proceed (entrance fee), take the driveway as far as it goes.  The driveway ends at a parking lot.  The trailhead is right at the edge of the parking lot.",
