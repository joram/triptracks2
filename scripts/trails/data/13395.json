    "description": "This is one of those falls that some people on social media were posting but when asked would only say it was a secret location.  Give me a break.  This fall has been in the public domain for at least a decade and sitting in my gps as a waypoint for that long.  If you wont to keep it a secret , don\u2019t post it on social media!\n\n\nThere is no trail to it but I did follow an old wood path for a while until it disappeared in a fallow field.   Regardless, the distance is short so no trail is needed.  Get off the Cabot Trail and cross Aspy River.  Find Archies Brook and follow it upstream for about 500m to the fall.   I passed some of the largest maple trees I have ever seen in my life going towards the fall.  Once at the fall, a careful climb leads to the upper fall which has a deep pool at its base, perfect for a soaking.",
    "directions": "Cabot Trail from Cape North Towards Pleasant Bay.   Have a look at my gpx track or find Archies Brook on a topo map.  The fall is where Archies Brook exits its awesome rocky valley.",
