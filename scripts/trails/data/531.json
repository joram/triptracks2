    "description": "Westminster Abbey in Mission is a Benedictine monastery. The monastery sits atop what is locally known as St. Mary's Hill. There are five trails in the area.  There are a few different forks in the main trail that split off to different parts; go check it out. \r\n\r\nJacob's Ladder for instance, is one of the most technical trails.  Others are fast and some are really easy. There are few techy jumps in the area nor ladder-bridges.  Some of these optional trail deviations are under construction by other rabid bikers.  Here are the \"vague\"",
    "directions": "Get into Mission and head up to Dewdney Trunk Road. Go east along the road and eventually you will come up to a right turn that will take you to the monastery. Head along the walking trails and you will come to a soccer field at one area. In this field there is an opening in the trees, and you're where the trail starts. The opening is right at the start of the field so don't go to the other end looking for it.\r",
