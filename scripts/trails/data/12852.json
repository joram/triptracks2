    "description": "This is one of those hidden gems that I am super happy to share.   I stumbled upon an old DFO report on Salmon Rivers of NS.  A section on the West sheet Harbour River described a barrier to salmon in the upper reaches of the W Sheet Harbour River!  I was super psyched to try to get to it and see this for myself.  I could not find any information on a fall in this area.I set off from a logging road through, unfortunately, a recently logged area.  However I only had 500m to walk.  Soon, the loved area ended and I could hear the roar of the water.  Lo and behold, a 25 ft waterfall lay jus ahead of me.  What was special here is that you wouldn't expect to see anything in this section of the river as there are no tall hills anywhere except where the river has gouged out the fall.  The fall has a large pool at its base and it seems a large flat area to the side to accommodate a tent.",
    "directions": "Highway 224 from Sheet Harbour.  Drive to a logging road at 45.045514, -62.810094 (opposite Rocky Brook Lake).  Drive 600m and head into the woods on the right of the road.",
