    "description": "The area around Wright's Lake is becoming increasingly developed (Westwood Hills subdivision), but the upper part of the lake is still quiet and pristine, and provides a nice paddling experience very close to the city. Lots of tiny islands dot the lake, giving plenty of opportunities to stop for a break, a picnic or a swim.",
    "directions": "From the shopping plaza at Tantallon (exit 5 on Hwy 103), follow Westwood Blvd all the way to the end of the development, to Wright's Lake. There is a gravel path from the road (parking available) to a convenient put-in spot.",
