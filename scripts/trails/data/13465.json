    "description": "I was finishing my day of waterfall explorations in the Cobequids and decided to check a pair of waypoints I had on two brooks running side by side  in the back of the Dutchmens Farm.  Jackson Brook had a nice ravine bu no falls that I could find.  Next to it is moore Brook.  It starts like any other brook but soon it enters these pretty deep ravines.  One of the smallest tributary (and ravine) actually ends on a rock wall where (if there was lots of rain) a 30 ft waterfall could be found (N45.39980\u00b0 W63.84131\u00b0).    The ravine are nice enough to make this a cool little hike to tack on at the end of a day.",
    "directions": "Highway 2.  Turn on Bronw Road and park 850m after turning from the highway.  Bushwhack to the stream",
