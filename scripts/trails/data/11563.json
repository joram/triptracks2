Trail starts at Lake Louise canoe rental cabin, you go up to Saddleback and when you see Saddle Mountain on your left, you can start to hike up at any point after the big gully you will see when view opens up on the Mountain. Otherwise, you can hike up to Saddleback and take the first trail on your left then.",
