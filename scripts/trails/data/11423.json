    "description": "I was looking for some places to explore near Meteghan. There was a road near this cove so it was easy to get to it and so I set forth. The old road leading to the cove lis in good shape and the beach os mostly made up of cobbles. I explored both sides of the cove walking on the rocks and to my surprise found a natural arch on the eastern side of the cove. The arch is made up of two types of rock. The top portion looks really slate-like so the arch may not be there forever. To make it to the arch you will need some kind of a low tide so check your tide tables before heading out.\r\n\r\n\u00a0UPDATE i am local to this place, I'm not sure when as i only found out about this when it was too late but the arch has fallen. You can still tell where it was though. Still lots of hiking to be done down here.\u00a0",
    "directions": "Highway 1 west past Meteghan. Turn right on Bear Cove Rd and park at the 90 degree turn. Walk down the old road to the cove.",
