    "description": "There is only maybe 1km or so of real MTB singletrack from Meetinghouse Road down to 2 lanes NW of Meetinghouse Road corner, but you can also ride up the road across increasingly rough, narrow 'road' and eventually up to Mile's Pond.  The last few hundred meters to the pond won't fit a vehicle (I tried to no avail and those rentals go *anywhere*).\r\rYou can tie this into rides along to Birch Hill and the other hill in the area.\r\rA nice enough and quiet enough area for some nice riding if you're in the area, but I wouldn't make a road trip to do just this.\r\rThis trail was brought to my attention by Elke @ Points East Guest Haus just up (North) the road a bit. A great place to stay and a *very* knowledgeable lady on the ECT and Newfoundland Culture in general.",
    "directions": "From downtown Pouch (Pooch) Cove, take Meetinghouse Road SouthWest about 800m to trailhead in outside edge of a bend.  Actually you can park anywhere up here and ride around.  Easy to find.",
