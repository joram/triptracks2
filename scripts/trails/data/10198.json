    "description": "A nice hike up an interesting mountain, as of 2011 the path is grown up  significantly and there were big puddles of water and grass growing on a lot of the road. Dryer weather would certainly make the hike more enjoyable. \nThere are steep, slippery rocks to climb which might be harder for some people but it isn't really difficult hike.  There is a nice view of Shogomoc Lake at the top, you have to walk around  the top of the mountain for the view. \nIt is about 2.5km to the top, and 5km round trip. There were other side paths, but I don't know where they go.",
    "directions": "Drive or walk out the logging road, avoiding the logging trucks which use \nthe road (should go without saying). There is an obvious path leading into the woods which you can see on my GPS Track log.",
