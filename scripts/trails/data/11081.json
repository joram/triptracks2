    "description": "For the experienced route finder: Starts on the classic \"cliff lake\" trail which goes up the creek and a scramble up beside the waterfall to the lake, hike along the lake then over the mountain pass, down into a large basin then over another mountain pass then down into the last valley which after some bush whacking joins up with sunken creek trail which takes you all the way out to the fort steel wardner road",
    "directions": "From Galloway or the Fort Steel Wardner road, head up Bull River FSR until you come to Van Creek FSR wich you turn left onto, follow this until you come to the well marked \"Cliff Lake Trail\" trail head",
