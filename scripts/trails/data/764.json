    "description": "NTS Map:92B5.  At Muir Creek you can walk down to the mouth of the Orveas Bay estuary (west side of the creek) and along the cobble beach that faces the Juan de Fuca Straight. Along the beach to the west, you can find fossils preserved in the sandstone cliff face and rocks on the shore.\r\n \r\nA 6 kilometre round trip hike along the beach will take about three to four hours to complete, as the cobble can be difficult to walk along. From the parking lot, a hard packed dirt path leads you to beginning of the beach area. The piles of driftwood and bull kelp that line high tide mark on the south west shore of the estuary soon give way to the narrow beach that is boarded by steep cliffs. Be sure to check the tide tables, as much of the beach is impassable at high tides.\r\nThere is GPS data attached to this trail (see \"download GPS\"), which if loaded into your GPS can help you find route points.\r",
