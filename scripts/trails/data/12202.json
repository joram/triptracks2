    "description": "This is one of these hikes that ended up being a bit of a waste of time.  I had some indications that there was a 15ft fall on this brook and I was in the general area anyways so I took the chance to explore that area.  Unfortunately, I snowshoed for more than an hour and a half and I only have a few cascades to report from this brook.  None of them close to 15ft.   However, as I have previously experienced, I may have just turned around too soon.  If there is anybody out there that knows of a good fall on this brook, I would appreciate a comment.  BTW there were some pretty cool rock walls opn the western side of the brook from time to time.",
    "directions": "Just before Morden, turn on McNally Rd towards Visctoria Harbour.  brown Brook flows under that road at N45.11251 W64.87097",
