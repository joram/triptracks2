    "description": "This is the path you can take to get to the alpine area of Semaphore Lakes and its surrounding ponds and tarns.  The trip there is nothing to write home about, until you hit the 80% mark and punch through the woods.  The trail can be hard to find at times, so I've included a GPS.  From Semaphore Lakes, you can ascend any number of the surrounding summits.",
    "directions": "Travel from Pemberto to the Hurley FSR.  Follow it up for about 35-40 minutes, a little past the Tenquille Lake turn off, and you'll see a small parking lot to your left.",
