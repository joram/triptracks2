    "description": "NTS Map:92C9, NTS Map:92C8.  The Juan de Fuca trail stretches along the southern shore of Vancouver Island, from China beach (outside of Jordan river) to Port Renfrew. Terrain is varied and can be hiked in 10 K day-trips, the most difficult section being between Mystic Beach and China Beach, where you hike in and out of 17 creek valleys with climbs on the average of 100m, along switchbacked terrain. The remaining portions of the trail can be completed with relative ease. The easiest portion lies between Port Renfrew and Parkinson Creek. The trail can be divided into 10 km sections: China Beach to Mystic Beach (easy), Mystic Beach to Chin Beach (most difficult), China beach to Sombrio Beach(difficult), Sombrio to Payzant Creek ( moderate), Payzant Creek to Botanical Beach ( easy)  \nThe flora and fauna as well as the landscape are diverse--sightings of black bears and cougars have been reported, especially in the early fall when the salal berries are plentiful. The landscape varies from old growth cedar forest to replanted 15 yr old clear-cut, and beaches that are pebbles ( Sombrio) to sand ( Mystic beach)",
    "directions": "A trail bus leaves from downtown Victoria to the trailhead every day, or if driving from Victoria, follow Hwy 14 until the China Beach trailhead is reached.  The other trailhead (this is not a loop trail) is in Port Renfrew, which is another 30 km along the highway.  So taking the trail bus is the best idea.\nwww.trailbus.com",
