    "description": "This track was captured from a hike starting at the end of Gibson Road, following an unofficial trail running along the top of the Eardley Escarpment, then the down the northern leg of the Luskville Falls hiking trail.  Our mission on this day was to find a few of the more remote Geocaches in the Gatineau.  There are other caches nearby not included in this GPX file.\r\rThe unofficial trail we called ?Cron?s Trail? after the fellow cacher who had shared his track log with us.  There were places where the trail crossed rock outcrops, and snaked about to make use of beaver dam crossings, so the exact path isn?t evident to the eye.  We choose to scale the escarpment at Gibson Road, but day hikers might choose to start from the public parking at the bottom of the Luskville Falls trail.\r",
    "directions": "Take Hwy 148 northeast from Aylmer.  The access road to public parking by the Luskville trail is well marked.",
