    "description": "This route is a combination of popular and widely used trails and one that is little known and not on any of the maps. It has something for everyone, flat, hills & view. I have indicated it as moderate but, depending on your experience, parts can be difficult depending on which direction you do it in. I have shown it as starting on \"Coming Round the Mountain\" but, it is also pleasant going the other way.",
    "directions": "Travel to the main gate & parking lot at Kalamalka Lake Park. At the back (East) of the parking lot, you will find the entrance to the \"Coming Round the Mountain Trail\". Follow this trail until you come to \"The Wall\" Trail and go left on it. Once you get to the top, follow the power line poles to the top of the cliff. You will find the Cliff Trail at this location. Enjoy the view of the whole valley then start down. When you get to the bottom, you can go right which takes you to the main trail going back to the parking lot or Cosens Bay or, you can take the left trail which follows the bottom of the hill. The left trail is a lot more pleasant and recommended. It also lets you know where the trail is if you decide to try the hike in the reverse order.",
