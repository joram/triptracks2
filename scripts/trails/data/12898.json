    "description": "This is a combination of Beach trail and hills climb trail, ending up at the Heceta Head Lighthouse.The trail starts at the Carl G. Washbourne Trailhead and proceeds south along the beach for 1.2 miles. Moderate climbing starts here and goes over \"The Hump\" before descending to the Heceta Lighthouse at 2.8 miles out.The return follows the same route, but you should be aware of the changing tides, although only very high tides would hamper hiking on the beach.",
    "directions": "TAKE HWY 101 SOUTH OF NEWPORT, OREGON FOR ABOUT 40 MILES,TURN RIGHT (WEST) & GO AROUND CIRCLE TO CARL G. WASHBOURNE BEACH PARKING.FOLLOW THE TRAIL IN THE SW CORNER OF THE TRAILHEAD TO THE BEACH.",
