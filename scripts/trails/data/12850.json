    "description": "I was looking at some maps of the Yarmouth area as I was gong there to work.  I noticed that the Salmon River is a main watershed in this area but I had never explored for falls on that system.  A quick view of the sat imagery revealed some white foam on the bank of the river immediately downstream of a heavily wooded area.  I then ask someone who lives locally if I knew of the falls.  A friend of his confirmed it along with the name of Micmac Fall.A short walk on an ATV trail follows the Salmon River as it flows downstream.   A fe hundred metres on a fairly level path leads to some rocky outcrops and then the small Micmac falls.  I have seen some pictures of people running that fall in the spring by canoe!",
    "directions": "Highway 101.  Take the Salmon River exit and drive on the Hectanooga Rd for 6km.  At this point there is a dirt road on your left.  Park there and cross the Salmon River via a bridge and walk downstream to the fall following the ATV path.",
