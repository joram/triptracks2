    "description": "This is the continuation of the Trail that I started on the Housatonic in Massachusetts.  More of the same twisted, curvey beautiful river.  This leg has a portage about two miles south of the border around an old failed dam.  You can paddle down this portion but you should have whitewater experience and the right boat.  Just before the portage keep an eye out for an historic house on the right.  The Borland Farm is well marked and my recollection is that it was the home of a famous naturalist and outdoor writer.  There is a massive takeout and parking lot in Falls Village.  You can't continue past it as there is a massive drop down to the next level of the river.",
    "directions": "We started this trail in Sheffield Mass and my directions can be found on that trail.  The put in was right next to the AT, just off Rt. 7 in Sheffield Mass.",
