    "description": "NTS Map: 082O02This is a 5.4 km hike in the foothills in the Sibbald area. The trail head is 1 km from the parking spot. From the trail head, the trail is 3.4 km. It follows along the side of a hill for about 1 km. Then things get fun. The trail follows a series of switcback, climbing about 170 meters within the next 1.5 km. At the top there is a bench to rest on. The view from here is nice but the growth of the trees is starting to block some of the view. From here the trail goes steadly downhill for about 1 km to the trail head. For the work it takes to get to the top, I don't think the view was worth it. Best described as a great family walk.",
