    "description": "Mt. Brennan is a challenging and rewarding hike. The peak requires no technical skill beyond putting one foot in front of the other. Just be prepared to do that for 8.6 kilometres to the peak. The few is worth it.",
    "directions": "Drive 23.3km west of Kaslo on Highway 31. Turn north onto the forest service road there. Zero your odometer. At 2.4km stay left. At 7km park at a sharp switchback. Hopefully there will be flagging tape there.",
