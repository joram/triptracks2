    "description": "Levette Lake is accessed from Levette Lake Forestry Road and is an out and back through trails built in 1962 from a grant from the employment bridging assistance program.  The trail has a few signs, but the most conspicuous markers are the coloured covers from tin cans nailed to trees.  Spectacular views into the Tantalus range of mountains-especially Alpha and Zenith Mountains. Levette Lake once reached is a pleasant place for lunch and a quick dip, weather permitting.",
    "directions": "Driving North from Vancouver on the Sea-to-Sky highway #99, drive past the town of Squamish and look for the intersection with Alice Lake on your right and Squamish Valley Road on your left.  Turn left onto Squamish Valley Road, and turn right on Paradise Valley Road.  About 1.5km look for the Levette Lake Forestry road, then turn left.  The trail head is on the road, in fact the hike route stays on the road before going into the forest.",
