    "description": "Shortish bushwack to the side of one of Nova Scotia's longest and prettiest rivers.  I was always wondering when I would see a fall on this brook.  I happened on some canoe NS maps showing ripples and ekes! a fall.   Bushwack through the mixed forest to the side of the river to see the monster fall of the St Mary's River a whopping 3ft...ah well it's scenic and unique for this river",
    "directions": "Drive to Trafalgar and take the Cameron Settlement Rd going towards Caledonia.  Turn immediately on dirt road passed the intersection of the highway 374",
