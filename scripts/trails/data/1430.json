    "description": "The trail follows ATV and snowmobile trails that gain access to the power lines.  The trail system connects up with the trail to Turtle mountain in the south which leads to Saint John and the Irving Nature park.  You can also go north to Bald Peak and then into camp Gagetown.",
    "directions": "From Saint John follow highway 7 towards Fredericton.  Just before the town of Welsford you will see the Eagle Rock picnic area on the left. The trail can be accessed from a point about 100 yards south of Eagle Rock picnic area, or from the back of  my camp 2 km further along highway 7.",
