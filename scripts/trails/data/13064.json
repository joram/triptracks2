    "description": "Again this is a spot I visited a long time ago but forgot to post.  The falls here are not very tall but the river is quite large and after a big rain storm, the falls can be impressive.  The rest of the time, the small falls are quite known as a swimming spot.  There is a trail going to it from both sides of the river but it seems, the one on the west side can be driven for a while and then a short walk of about 300m or less gets you to the falls.",
