    "description": "The Hike is a good hike on a day where the temperature is not extreme, it can get very hot with it exposure south and west. Great views of the area and all around. Some of trail is over crumbly volcanic rock watch your knees on this stuff . The trail is kind of a horseshoe  shape  from a birds eye view comes back out onto a forest service road above Falkland BC .  Point from which I hiked is lat 50.515843\u00b0  long -119.617929\u00b0 . lots of parking at both ends of the trail.  The east end has a set of ropes to help descend the steep part of the trail. The usual trail actually go to Estekwalan Mountain Elevation: 1772 m / 5813 ft . But maybe in a next hike I will get that track,  it probably extends the hike by 2 or 3 hrs. Accent on this hike was 706m  descent was 612m. Early spring will have snow in areas.",
