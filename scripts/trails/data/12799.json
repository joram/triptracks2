    "description": "I was in this area to look for some old mining adits.  I followed my gps to an old rock pile and was disappointed until?I could hear a waterfall! Within a minute I was on the side of a beautiful multi tier waterfall.  The river here looses some 30ft of elevation in two very broad waterfalls.  There is a faint trail on the side of the river which led to the fall and started somewhere more to the north 9maybe by the lake?)   I took a few pictures and then looking at the rocky walls on the side of the river, I decided to explore further downstream to see if there were more signs of mining activities.  Sure enough within a few minutes I was standing in a 8m long adit carved on the side of the river.",
    "directions": "In West Erinville, take the Upper Glencoe Rd and turn on Sullivans Rd.  The falls are 300m from the road at; 45\u00b023'37.42\"N, 61\u00b045'57.19\"W.  The adit is further downstream on the west side of the river.",
