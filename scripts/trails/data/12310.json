    "description": "This is a spot that was in my GPS for a while.  On the 1:50 000 topo its called Big Cascade and it is located off a logging road in Beaverbank.  The logging roads are owned by Barretts Lumber.  I parked at the gate and hoped on my mtn bike.  The ride is about 5.5km one way and there is surprisingly lots of small hill for a total ascent/descent of the whole trip of 230m.You keep to the main road and when you have hiked about 5km, you turn to a secondary road on your right.  the Beaverbank river is just down the small hill.  the Big Cascade is actually just at the end of this road but there are more smaller falls upstream and downstream of it.   Big cascade is actually a good name now that I have seen this place.  Not truly a fall but scenic enough to go check out.",
    "directions": "Highway 354 North.  turn on Pinehaven Dr and then right on Lakeland St.  Park at the gate.  the cascades are located at N44\u00b0 51' 21.3\" W63\u00b0 43' 40.3\"",
