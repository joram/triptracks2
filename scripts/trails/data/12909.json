    "description": "Gaspereau River TrailDid this twice this fall - really nice 4.5'ish km one way trail along the river and through woods.  I put 'moderate' as you walk along the side of a hill and you really have to be careful not to slide down.  A couple of us walked along the river returning to avoid that part but could not get through that way only to have to climb up a steep embankment - I had lift and pull on each end, thank you.",
