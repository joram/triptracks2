    "description": "It is a short, steep, gully with the singletrack swooping across it from edge to edge with banked corners at each reversal.  600m long and ~60m of descendingbut feels like more with all the swicthbacks and G-forces.  It's fun, good for building some new skills, is especially good if you can work it in to the trip home, unfortunately we went down then had to slowly pedal back up.  All rideable by intermediate+ riders with some legs.  The bottom end of Snake conveniently drops you into Inns of Banff Park receiving doors and beside Banff Avenue.  They sell all you can eat Sushi there (or used to a couple years back).\nThis and 6 other trails (Hoodoos, Tunnel Mountain Loop Singletrack, Star Wars, The Toe, Snake and Water Tower) form a buncha new mountain bike trails within Banff Park.  In the past, there were *very* limited options for riding in the woods of National Parks.  But thanks to a philosophy change by Parks Canada and some *VERY* hardworking volunteers at the Bow Valley Mountain Bike Alliance (BVMBA), we now have these to enjoy.  And you WILL enjoy them, they're good!.  And even better, there are more coming, the BVMBA tells me late spring 2012 should have another new, technical trail open near Star Wars.  Support you local MBA, BVs trail building night is Wednesdays, bring boots & gloves, they have a Pulaski with your name on it.",
