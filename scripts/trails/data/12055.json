    "description": "The eastern shore doesn't offer a lot of waterfall but I managed to bushwack my way to one of about 15ft.  That's not very high but its high enough for that area to warrant a trip.  The bulk is on an old logging road slowly getting overcrowded by alders.  I managed to drive most way.  After the logging road ends it a matter of bushwacking about 600m some moderately dense mixed forest to the streamand fall.",
    "directions": "Highway 7 to Sheet Harbour.  Turn left on dirt road immediately after the bride over the West Shhet Harbour River.  The end of the logging road where I parked is approx at;  44.945848\u00b0, -62.552711\u00b0 and the fall is at  44.944478\u00b0, -62.557323\u00b0",
