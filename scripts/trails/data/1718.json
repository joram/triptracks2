    "description": "The Dentist is meant for experienced riders who are able to take big jumps. The dentist features a 7 foot high ladder, a super cool coaster and several drops. Its a good 30 minutes-1 hour of uphill depending on your shape. WARNING-DENTIST IS VERY DIFFICULT, SERIOUS INJURY CAN OCCUR, DO NOT ATTEMPT WITHOUT A PARTNER!! The man who built the dentist test rode it, flipped over, and knocked out almost all his teeth, how do u think it got the name, \"the dentist\"?",
    "directions": "From Panorama drive, park your car at noons creek park. You will see a trail just left of the houses on the right side of the road. Follow this trail up, past the steep hill, down a little farther till you get to a fork in the trail. Turn left, go up for another 20-30 minutes until you reach the summit. After having a break, look for the sign.",
