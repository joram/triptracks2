    "description": "We were more than fortunate to again have local guide Fred Bridger showing us all the hot spots and this is a cool trail.  It deserves much more than the 1 hour and 47 minutes we afforded it.  There are beaches, narrow valleys, a natural arch, a bit of scrambling if you want..  it has it all.  A must do if in the area.\n4.5 kilometers and probably close to 200 meters of cumulative climbing (though you go from sea level to a maximum of 50m ASL).\nYou will get to walk across tundra looking landscapes, singletrack, some stairs, rocks and only a couple of roots, it is an enjoyable trail. Watch for old root cellars and the site of Suggs' 3 walled house (the rock face was the 4th wall).\nIf you're in the area, you'll find Fred at the wonderful B&B run by his wife Mildred.  Paradise B&B and Paradise it was.  As friendly a place as you could hope for and backing right on to Notre Dame Bay and across the bay, Downtown Twillingate.  Freds gardening and pruning skills are in abundance with his Larch trees being the fruits of his labour.\nWe were more than unfortunate as to the time of day we did this trail !! Check the track log, we started at 02h30 (Mountain Daylight Time), but still that was 06h00 local time.  We had to catch a mid-morning ferry out to Fogo, so the only chance to do this trails was bright and &^%*% early.  I had heard it was nice at this time of the day and yes, it was pretty special.",
    "directions": "Hiway 340 on South Twillingate Island, about 2/3 of the way South (if that is confusing, how about 3.4 km North of the South causeway).  Turn N on a small road for about 400m.  The small roads may be marked as Little Harbour.",
