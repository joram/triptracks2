    "description": "This is an alternate route to the other Deeks Lake trail posting.  This trail starts from the Porteau Cove parking lot (exit at the new Porteau Cove overpass on highway 99).\nThe trail ascends right from the parking lot up a gravel logging road.  It is a tough slog up.  Follow the Howe Sound crest trail signs until you meet up at the tri-junction.  From here the trail goes up to the left to Deeks lake or to the right on the alternate Deeks Lake trail back to highway 99.",
    "directions": "Dive north on the 99 to Porteau Cove.  The parking lot is off the exit 10km past Lions Bay, this is a couple km's before Porteau Cove Provincial Campsite.",
