    "description": "This trail is a Bronze in the \"Passport to the peaks\" program, elevation gain 1200ft, trail head is at 5000ft. Menders through damp sub-alpine forest, then a short, steep climb to the first summit. A cairnbox is at the top of the second summit but requires a significant decent and re-ascent. Great views of Grande Cache and surrounding mountains!",
    "directions": "Drive 8km north of Grande Cache on Hwy. 40 and turn left onto the Beaver Dam Road. This dirt road can be a little rough depending on the weather. After driving for 6.8km, you top the pass and begin to descend. As soon as the road starts down watch for the signed crossroads. Right leads to Mt. Hamell, Left is the Ambler Loop. Park here and walk .5km on the Ambler Loop. Do not turn at the first left - look for well-flagged trailhead, second on the left.",
