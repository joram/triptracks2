    "description": "A 19 mile (30km) one way trip along a reclaimed rail trail.  It is uphill (nothing serious, under 2% grade) on the way out of town which makes for a nice cruise back into town on the way home.  You will see water falls, deer, squirrells, birds, flora, fauna and active and abandonded mining works (this is West Virginia remember).\r\rA very nice trip if you're not looking for high adventure.  Up the pace if you want some cardio.\r\rIt looks like you can keep riding the old rail bed past the official end at 19 miles, but I don't know what you'll find out there so you're on your own.",
    "directions": "The Rail Trail passes behind Senaca Center near Downtown Morgantown.  Decker Creek Tees off to the SouthEast 1 mile South of there.",
