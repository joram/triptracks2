    "description": "High Lake trail leads you through the beautiful northern ontario forests off Northshore Road, borrows a short section of from the Nordic Ski Club Blue Trail (in reverse) followed by 40 meters of bushwacking to a pristine little lake called High Lake.  This lake is incidentally stocked yearly with 600 fish - bring your rod.\nThere is a camping site located to the left of the access trail.  Very nice.",
    "directions": "Drive halfway down Northshore Road, pass the Ski Club, keep going, look to your left you will see a snowmobile sized trail leading up the mountain.  That's your trail.   GPS coordinates coming soon, for now checkout the map in images.",
