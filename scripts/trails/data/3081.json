    "description": "Quaite Valley to Prairie View trail with extension to Barrier Lookout. \r\nUsing two vehicles one positioned at the Barrier lake dam parking for use upon completion of the walk, this becomes a one way 14 km walk through Quaite Valley to Prairie View trail to the lookout and down to the Barrier lake Dam.\r\n\r\nThere are two trails through the Quaite valley the lower one is more travelled including by bikes. The upper one we used (see GPS track) is on the map but is fast becoming grown over and involves circum venting numerous fallen trees. It's not an an overly scenic trail either mostly in the trees however the scenery becomes great when you approach the lookout.",
    "directions": "Trans Canada Highway (1) east bound lane opposite Loder Peak sign, pull off at Quaite creek logging road, there is a sign at the trailhead.",
