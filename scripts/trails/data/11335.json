    "description": "We had a heck of a time finding the Judges Route trailhead for climbing Mt. Arrowsmith. This is the path we ended up taking. The turnoff is not marked, but comes on top of the Port Alberni summit right before you begin to descend to the city. It has a gated entrance that should be open.",
    "directions": "Highway 4 to Port Albernia From Parksville/Qualicum Beach area. Go past Cameron Lake but not all the way to Port Alberni",
