    "description": "Awesome trail well established extremely steep and extremely difficult, \"Definitely NOT FOR BEGINNERS\".About 1.6 KM each way and you drop about 100 m in elevation. Wicked drops with tight turns. \"Oh Mama' is redone and Rocs!. Awesome ladders and bridges.Enjoy!",
    "directions": "N.E. end of Abbotsford.Find McKee Rd and head towards Ledgeview Golf Course, just before Ledgeview on the left side of the road,(North), there is a small pull out big enough for maybe two or three vehicles to park alongside of the road.The trail heads north and begins to drop immediately. when you get to the pipeline Right of Way head across on a slight right angle, (Bearing 75 degrees almost due east), the trail picks up again on the other side of the right of way about 50 meters.",
