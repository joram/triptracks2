    "description": "This was a pleasant surprise for me.   In fall 2016 I stumbled upon this new to me fall!  I always wondered what hidden treasure could be on this brook.  From the highway it is so deep and has two large rock walls on either sides...almost like it was blasted in place.so one day I decided to follow it up although the contours did not show any potential.   I made my way down from the highway by climbing down the side of the bridge to the stream....then it was a matter of crossing back and forth as I made my way upstream.  On the way there , there was some fern walls that were really cool.   And sure enough after maybe 400m....there stood a 20ft fall.   It come out as a straight drop but then hugs the rock walls at the last two thirds.",
    "directions": "Highway 10 north of Bridgewater, pass New Germany, look for Shingle Mill Brook.  (see my gps track)",
