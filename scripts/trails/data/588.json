    "description": "NTS Map: 92G6. The trail starts at the base of Black Mountain very close to the parking lot.  It is a well-marked trail that takes you past some very beautiful areas.  The Black Mountain Loop is also worth hiking.  If you want to make it more interesting you can go along the ski hill for some different scenery.",
    "directions": "The trail starts very close to the Ski/Board rental tent at Cypress Mountain.  If you have a GPS, use the attached tracklog and put your GPS in trackback mode; it will automatically create a route and guide you along the trail.  Click Download GPS, above.",
