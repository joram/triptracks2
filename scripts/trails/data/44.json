Now a Senior of 80+, her and her husband still have their VW Bus, and, have taken to more flat walks and hikes with views, lunch breaks, here are a few attractions to Burnaby Lake- walk around Burnaby Lake- run around Burnaby Lake- watch rowers practice on the water (if not too weedy)- quiet, easy place to go- animal rescue shelter nearby, see various birds and ducks- Just North of the trans-Canada Hi-way, start at the West most entrance to the Park",
