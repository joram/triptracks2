    "description": "This is an easy to get to fall in the Halifax region.  Setting off from the cul de sac, you find a faint trail that leads to the river.  You can hear something from the road...but that's only some small rapids.  Keep on the trail for about 5 minutes or so and come to the upper fall which slides on top of some rocks.  the bottom of it is probably deep for a very nice swimming hole...which is probably why there is a trail to it!",
    "directions": "Picklock Rd.  Turn on white Hills Run and left on Gleneagles and then left on Stratton Crt.  Park at the end and walk to the river.  Walk upstream",
