    "description": "Berry Head Pond\nBerry Head Pond, located just 6km north of Rocky Harbour is another good short hike for some sightseeing in Gros Morne National Park. The 2km trail around the pond is mostly forested which makes it a good trail for windy days. It also winds though a small bog where Caribou can sometimes be seen grazing, and Newfoundland's provincial flower, the Pitcher plant grows in abundance.\nRyan Young\nNewfoundland Editor\nJanuary 2006",
