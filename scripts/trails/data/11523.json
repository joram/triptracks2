    "description": "If you ever went to Consolation Lakes, Panorama Ridge is the one on your left, with all those large gullies you can hike if they are snow free. You really have to be careful as there are a lot of rocks and boulders falling.We hiked up to the end of the first lake and up the gully between them. It's a 900 m straight up in less than 2 km. This ridge has 2 higher peaks of around 2800 metres, one at the end where you can see lots of pinnacles, the other one almost in the middle of the ridge where most hikers claim the summit (we did this one too), no climbing that way. You can also cross the river at the beginning of the first lake where there's another large gully, but it's hard not to get soaked there.",
    "directions": "Park at Moraine Lake and follow the trail to Consolation Lakes, starting right beside the washrooms. Once at the lakes, choose your gully up to the summit, that's it!",
