    "description": "As I was previously exploring in this area (Fall Brook Fall), I was looking for other possible waterfalls.  The topo map was showing some possibilities where Barnhill River empties into the Bay of Fundy.  I parked by some guard rails off the Shulie Rd and made my way downstream.  Under the highway is a huge perched culvert.  The design is very poor and probably prevents fish migration up this river.A few hundred feet downstream, there are 3 drops in succession, the first would be maybe 4ft high and the two other are more cascade types.   After these drops the river turns another 90 degrees and has a last drop of about 5ft.  There is the remnant of an old bridge at its foot and this fall might be covered by water at high tide.  I then just followed the west side of the cove and climbed up an impressive knife?s edge overlooking the river and cove.",
    "directions": "In Joggins, continue west on Shulie Rd towards Apple River.  The last fall is at; N45.65877\u00b0 W64.48606\u00b0",
