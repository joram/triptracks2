    "description": "NTS Map: 082J14This trail is 32km - 4 hours running, 6-7 hours hiking.This trail has a little something of everything.  It starts beside Ribbon Creek day parking area not far from Kananaskis Lodge.   It follows the Creek through the trees for about 10 kilometers.  After which, you encounter a waterfall.  Some people mountain bike this portion.  A kilometer or two behind the falls you will encounter approximately 30 feet of rocky cliff to scale.  The cliff face has spikes and chains in it so it is not too tough to scale.  Not far above the cliff  Ribbon Lake awaits.  There is a ranger station and a back country campsite beside the lake.  The trail wraps beside the lake for a kilometer or so before it continues up Guinns Pass.  As you leave the tree line you will encounter a lovely field of wild flowers.  After which 3-4 kilometers of steep shale climbing bring you the most breathtaking view of the Rockies. You can descend the other side on Galatea trail.   The Galatea trail parking lot is about 10 kilometers up the highway from the Ribbon Creek Parking lot.  The distance from starting parking lot to ending parking lot is 32 kilometers approximately.  There is a trail which runs beside the road back to Ribbon Creek Parking lot.  If you are not up the extra 10 k bring two cars, or better yet, a car and a few bikes!",
