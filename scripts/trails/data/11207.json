    "description": "The White Rim Road is a spectacular 101 mile (162 km) loop in Canyonlands National Park. It is a truly awesome mountain bike ride. It is not particular technical but there are lots of patches of soft sand and some steep climbs. The trail follows the Colorado and Green Rivers and than cuts across the Canyonlands Island In the Sky District.",
    "directions": "To reach the Island, take US Highway 191 to Utah Highway 313 (10 mi/16 km north of Moab, or 22 mi/35 km south of I-70) and then drive southwest 22 mi/35 km. Driving time to the visitor center from Moab is roughly 40 minutes.",
