    "description": "The nicest hike on our vacation.\r\rVery nice view of glacier and waterfalls. A part of the hike runs above the tree border. On half of the distance is a hut of the Alpine Club. The descent at the end of the hike is precipitous and strenuous.\r\rElevation gain 700m.",
    "directions": "From Highway 1 (Trans Canada Highway) turn north to Takakkaw Falls in Yoho National Park. (You need an National Parks pass). There is a parking area at the end of the road.\r\rParking for the Iceline trail is in the Takakkaw Falls parking area.",
