    "description": "Nice way to enjoy two cirques for the price of one!The traverse takes one high along the tree line. The trail is not well defined, but it is there. Short-cutting over rocks has it's risks!",
    "directions": "At the Highwood Pass, park in the parking area on the west side of the road. The trailhead is north about 100m and then across the highway. The Highwood Pass, at 2200 metres, is the highest driveable mountain pass in Canada. It is closed every winter for animal management. The Pass is on Hwy 40, about 50 km south of Hwy 1.It is a 1.5 km hike (or hitch) back along the road to the start.",
