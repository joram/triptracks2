    "description": "Dry Island Buffalo Jump Provinical Park has a number of trails in the Red Deer River Badlands. There are a number of unmarked trails started from the picnic ground.\nThe Dry Island itself is unique erosional feature. It can be accessed when you find the correct trail, we didn`t and consequently the attached GPS data does not go the island but just does a loop along the road and through the valley\nIf the gate is open you can drive to the picnic ground otherwise you`ll have to walk along the road. It`s closed during wet conditions.",
    "directions": "13 Km north of Trochu, on Highway 21 take Township Road 344 east for 19km to the park. When gate is close park at the top of the hill",
