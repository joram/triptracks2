    "description": "Nice single track trail that leads you through an area that was devastated by Hurricane Juan sometimes ago.  subsequently to the hurricane, there was some logging to remove all the deadfall.  The trail runs into the open for most of its length.  There are some minimal rocks and roots but overall its pretty smooth by Halifax standards.  Towards the end of the trail, you link up with some more fun trails with such names as six pack, lego and spintastic!  All these smaller trails are so much fun.  there are some large mounds of dirt that are smooth and fast \nto ride on or over....maybe the best kept secret in HRM!",
    "directions": "Drive on Waverley Rd, Turn on Spider Lake Estates Rd.  Park at the end of the trail by the power lines.  Ride under the power lines and up the ATV track until you see the signs on the left for the Hurricane Trail approximately 1.5km from your car.",
