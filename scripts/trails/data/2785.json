    "description": "NTS Map: 092J08\r\n\nThis attractive summit is generally approached from the Duffy Lake Road. The favored route is via Cerise Creek, although it can be accessed using the logging road that follows Van Horlick Creek, or when the snow line is still high, via a logging road up Twin One Creek from Lillooet Lake.\r\n\nFollow the Cerise Creek winter trail until you reach the Anniversary Glacier moraine wall. Follow the left (south) branch of the creek to gain the col just west of Vantage Peak. Drop down to Twin One Lake, then head SE across steeper ground to a meadow at the headwaters of a small eastern tributary of Van Horlick Creek. The summit of Snowspider can be gained via the NE ridge.\r\n\nAn interesting return loop from here would involve dropping down the south ridge of Snowspider, then heading NE past a series of small lakes, taking the easiest ground to reach Van Horlick Creek. A logging road following Van Horlick Creek north reaches the Duffy Lake Road at the western end of Duffy Lake.\r\n\nCurrent Conditions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na bit of anonymous trip footage",
