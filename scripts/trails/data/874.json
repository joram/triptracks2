    "description": "This trail runs through Gold Creek basin, at Snoqualmie Summit just outside of Seattle.  The day we were there the clouds were well below the surrounding peaks, so the potentially beautiful scenery was hidden in a gray blanket.\r\nThe trail itself runs along a forest service road for the first mile or so, then narrows down to a cabin trail and then down to a proper hiking trail.  This hike/snowshoe is well documented due to its ease and proximity to Seattle.\r\n\r\nWorth the trip?  Not by itself, but if you're in the area and want a wander through the woods, especially on a nice day?  This is a good choice.",
    "directions": "Take I-90 eastbound from Seattle.  Take Exit 54 (Hyak/Gold Creek) and pass north under the highway.  Turn right just after you pass under the highway.  Go about a mile and the trailhead is on the left-hand side, just past the bridge.\r\n\r\nThere is GPS data attached to this trail (see \"download GPS\"), which if loaded into your GPS can help you find route points.\r\nNote:  In winter, a $9.00 Sno-Park pass is required.  They are available from many outlets as well as the Forest Service information office at Snoqualmie Summit.\r\n\r",
