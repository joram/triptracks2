    "description": "This is one of those places I knew about for a long time but never took the time to get to it.  After a failed attempt to reach the summit with my telemark skis a long time ago, I had given up on this place.Until today that is.  We set off from the metal gate and turned to the right and cross a very new looking bridge.  after the bridge we turned to the left and followed the stream on a wide dirt road.  after some ascension and who my gps was pointing to the right, I saw some flagging tape.  We followed it through some beautiful hardwood forest and past some very good size boulders.  after only a few minutes and some good ascent, we made it to the big rock outcrop called Moses Mountain.  On the front and side, there is enough rock face for some bouldering or climbing with minimal moss growth.  To come back I went through the woods trying to find another rock outcrop but I missed it and will have to return to check it out",
    "directions": "Highway 14.  turn on at N44.88744 W64.21207.  Park at the gate.  The outcrop is at; N44.88843 W64.22574.",
