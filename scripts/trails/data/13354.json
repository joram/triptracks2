    "description": "Trail is more of a track that branches off a larger trail. It could be done as there and back, but other trails in area enable loops also. Trail is fully visible in summer, would likely need GPS data if hadn't been snowshoed in winter. The trailhead starts off of west side of Kueng Rd where it intersects with Crest Rd. The trail does fork, one route leads to the Whose Home Trail at Forests for the World, and the other meets up with Dreamcatcher. Going right at Dreamcatcher will take you back to trailhead, turning left, and left again at main trail will take you to the Greenway Trail.",
    "directions": "Park at Forests for the World, walk about 1.4 km back along Kueng Rd to trailhead. Can also access from Whose Home Trail at Forests for the World using the connector trail.",
