    "description": "The trail is maintained by the CRD while the land is owned by a logging company. It is suggested that you stay on the trail as the area surrounding the hike is being actively logged. The trail is an easy 45 minute hike at a leisurely pace and the views of the lake are quite picturesque especially in the summer when the frogs are singing on the lilypads. Late summer provides blackberries along the route and the trail is popular with dog walkers, horseback riders, mountain bikes and dirt bikes. This trail can be done year round.",
    "directions": "This trail is easy to find in Mill Bay by turning off of Frayne road and then left on Benko road until you reach the orange gate.",
