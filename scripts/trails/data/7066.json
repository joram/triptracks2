    "description": "Cross over the highway, and begin your bushwhacking straight up until you're above the treeline. You may come to a sheer wall, but some brief searching will result in an easy ascent to a relatively flat, treelined section, which will give you a good vantage point to observe the rest of the route. Make your way up scree slopes toward a gully. The gully is just beneath an ominous cliff band. Follow the gully up and over a rise, where you will find the remainder of your travels fairly easy.",
    "directions": "The Opal Ridge is on the East side of the Kananaskis Trail (Hwy 40). Park about one kilometre south of the Rocky Creek Bridge in a parking lot on the west side of the highway. This is near the Eau Claire Campground. Find the Rocky Creek Bridge, and it's easy to find the place to park. There is also a small general store that you can also park behind.  This is the fortress gas station where you can park at the north end of the parking area, head up a trail up the creek just a couple hundred meters to the power line.  Follow this cut line north (its flat) another couple hundred meters and after you cross the stream coming out of the gully, there is a trail that heads up to Opal.  The rest of the trail is obvious.  Follow it up.  The upper ridge is only a couple of kms long, but has amazing views and mostly level, so easy to traverse without altitude changes.",
