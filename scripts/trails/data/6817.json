    "description": "Cascade and Porter Mtns are 2 of 46 High Peaks in ADK, NY. Both two mountains are easiest ones in 46 HP.  Shortest distance trail is to start hiking from Cascade Lake side on Rt 73.  From the trailhead, it takes 2.1 miles to the junction of the trails.  One reaches to Mt Cascade (0.3 miles one way from junction) and another reaches to Porter Mtn (0.7 miles one way).   Since two mtns are very close each other, it's the best to visit both.  Trails are well maintained.  Near the summit of Cascade mtn is very rocky and steep.  At the top of both mountains are windy and cold.  It's better to have wind braker or rain gear etc.",
    "directions": "The trailhead is located on Rt 73, 6.8 miles from Keene and 4.5 miles from Adirondak Loj Rd, and is marked with red DEC disks.  These 2 mountains are so pupular and parking lot has been a problem.  You may want to get to the trailhead as early as possible to secure parking lot.",
