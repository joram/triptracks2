    "description": "Its hard to find the trail head,  well actually the road that leads to the trailhead. The GPS was pretty useful and after driving roads that seemed too under used we found the the trail is really easy except the last 200 meters there are ropes set up to help your descent and they are needed!  My 6 year old made the descent but it took time to do it safely with her.    Anyway the falls are wonderful.\nThere is a geocache near the falls.",
    "directions": "The turn off is across from Bay Gardens RV park exiting right onto dirt road near the North River bridge.  Follow the dirt road to a sharp left bend, then exit left onto old logging track at next sharp right bend.\nFollow old logging road down small hill and to the right, through a flat area, until you can hear the falls on your left.  Look for a small trail on the left, leading down steep hill to the base of the falls.  The last part of the trail descends steeply on a loose bank to the falls (use the ropes to help with the descent).  Extreme care should be used on this part of the trail.",
