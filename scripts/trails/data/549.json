    "description": "This is a beautiful alpine trail.  You start in the forest at the parking lot and end up at the summit of Mt Steel. The trail is average and fairly well kept. The trail is well marked for hiking in the summer and snow shoeing in the winter. It?s a great full day hike in the spring through fall; recommend staying the night at the cabin in the winter. Summit is 5400+ feet; the cabin is roughly 7-800 feet below in a nice little valley. You must take precautions for avalanches in the area, mostly in mid to late winter; otherwise just play safe.\r\n\r\nGreat scenery of the Strait of Georgia and surrounding coastal mountains. Lots of photo opportunity and wildlife viewing.",
    "directions": "Catch the ferry from Horseshoe Bay (Vancouver) to Langdale (Sunshine Coast)--it is a 45 minute ride. Drive from Langdale to Sechelt--roughly a 1 hour drive. Sechelt is a small town, but should have a few last minute purchases if needed. From Sechelt drive 30 minutes northeast towards Tuwanek,  You will go past Porpoise Bay Park, but keep following main road. You will drive over a bridge, Grey Creek, and about 300 hundred yards after, you will come to a logging road on your right. This is Jackson Bros. Main logging road.  There is usually not much logging, but just take your time and drive with lights on. From the pavement to the parking lot you will drive for 30-45 minutes. This is a 2-wheel drive road but in the winter I suggest a 4-wheel drive (maybe chains). Once you arrive at the trailhead, park the vehicle and begin a great adventure into the coastal beauty.\r",
