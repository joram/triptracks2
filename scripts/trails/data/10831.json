    "description": "A medium length relatively easy hike near Vancouver offering a some great views of Howe sound.You are on the trail all the time. Some new sections of the trail (this track is up-to-date) Simply follow the GPS track. On the way down follow the same route or descend on a ski run as marked.The trail is being improved all the time however the upper reaches are still amongst tree roots. The views from the Bowen Island lookout and the summit itself are stunning.",
    "directions": "The hike starts at the upper parking lot of the Cypress resort. Any vehicle will do.From another submission (added to this):Follow the signs off Highway 1 for the Cypress Mountain ski area. Go to the end of the road and park in the top lot - it's free. Look for the Olympic Rings and walk past them towards the Lions Express lift. Once past this you should see a sign for the Pump House road. Follow this track past the green storage tank and you are on the trail. If you follow the sign for the Howe Sound Crest Trail through the trees you will miss the Bowen Island lookout. An alternative route to start the trail is to follow the signs for Yew Tree Lake trail and this will take you to a point further up the Pump House rod.",
