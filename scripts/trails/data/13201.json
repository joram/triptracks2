    "description": "I know of a few more falls on this brook but they are located in the lower reaches.  I spotted something that looked good on sat imagery and decided to explore to it.  The old track is easy to follow and alders are starting to crowd it in.  After a km or so veer into the woods.  The top is flat and then it becomes ridiculously vertical.  After hiking or climbing down about 700ft, I was on the side of the brook and soon was at the foot of a very nice fall.  I continued to follow the river and found a better place (more gentle slope) to climb back up to my car.",
