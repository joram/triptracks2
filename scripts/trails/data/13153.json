    "description": "Well this was a big surprise for me.  I have worked on this brook for a few years and have seen a few smaller falls.  I could see something that looked promising on the sat imagery so I set forth to a spot way downstream on this brook.I used established path the whole way which was good indication that there could be something good coming up.  I wasn't disappointed, there is a fairly good size fall here, the largest of all the falls on Roxbury Brook.  I am doing another post for the upper falls as they are quite distant and have no path to them.The lower falls are at; 44.852316, -65.191188",
    "directions": "From highway 201 in West Paradise, take roxbury road and drive about 1.2km.  There is an old road on the right here.  Park, walk down the road.  At the end of this road, go right and walk down about 120m.  Turn left and walk down that path to the brook and fall.",
