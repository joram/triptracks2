    "description": "This is a short hike through a mostly conifer-loaded forest to a set of falls on a brook which empties into Grand Lake.  Setting off from the car, you enter the woods to the left of the road in an area that has been logged.  then it;'s just a matter of making your way to the stream and then follow it downstream.Just before the falls there is a large grassy area.  It is a tempting spot to go across but rest assured the time saved will be offset by the soaking of your boots in this water filled area.The falls are never bigger than 5-6ft but are quite scenic nonetheless and they are a short distance to Halifax",
    "directions": "Highway 2.  In Wellington, turn on Kings Road and follow it do almost it's conclusion....not all the way as it becomes someone's driveway at the end.  I parked at N44 53 51.8 W63 37 40.7.",
