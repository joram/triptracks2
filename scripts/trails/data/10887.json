    "description": "Roughly following Stoney Creek (Camrose Creek?) there is an excellent set of XC trails right in the middle of Alberta's Blue Collar Heartland.  Consisting of multiple, integrated loops in the whole rainbow of colours (Green/Easy, Blue and Black/Difficult).Built in 1990 for the Alberta Winter Games (probably), it is a completely professional, technical, and wonderful facility.A wax room and set of bathrooms are near the North end of the trails which also has some great learning grounds out of the way of the main loops.A Biathlon Range at the South end is just like the pros use.  I could hear a few people plinking away on it as we were skiing, but they had shut down by the time we got there.Camrose itself is a nice little town, but *everything* downtown was closed on the Sunday afternoon we tried to spend some money there.  Fortunately, the main strip on the highway has coffee and eats for sustanance.If you're driving from Edmonton to Calgary, this is totally worth the 80km detour.",
    "directions": "39 Ave and 53 Street (just off 55 street into what *looks* to be a residential crescent gets you to the bathrooms and wax room, a nice facility.  You can also get to it off 50 Street South of 44 Ave or at the Biathlon Range 50 Street way South down to Township Road 463.  Or even from the Pumping station.",
