    "description": "87 to 115 km Leave from Mont Megantic. This was a very challenging trail with bushes, swamps, mountains and many more obstacles. Bring your GPS and compass for the first section since the trail is not marked well. A lot of this hike runs along the Quebec/Main border along a very rugged cut line that marks the border. There are 2 mountains, Mont Marble and Mont Gosford. \r\n\r\nLoved it, 11 Days 10 nights",
    "directions": "Go into the store in La Patrie(east of sherbrooke) and ask for the map, they will have it there. Park near the border and leave from mont Magantic(you will need a ride). Email me if you need more details.  \r\n\r\nPark Office is 9.5km East on Hiway 212 from the intersection of Hiways 212 and 257 in La Patrie.",
