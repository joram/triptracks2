    "description": "Walking path through a forested area, which leads to a great view of Dawson Brook Falls. The waterfall is beautiful, was very full after a day of rain. Some light bushwhacking may be required, as the trail doesn't seem to be well-used.",
    "directions": "From Halifax, follow Highway 101 towards Annapolis Valley. Look for gated logging road (unpaved) on left side, roughly 3 km before the Ellerhouse Overpass. Park on road side and walk down the access road until you see bridge across Dawson Brook. Just before bridge a path forks right into woods. Follow this right path along bank of brook until you hear the waterfall.",
