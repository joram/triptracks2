    "description": "There is a nice secret valley carved by a branch of Knoydart Brook in the Eigg Mountain wilderness area.  I was looking at some satellite imagery and this valley caught my eye as potential for falls AND a rocky outcrop perhaps good for climbing.  \n\nMy starting point was not good and the first few hundred metres was horrible with too much deadfall to go through.  However, upon reaching the valley, the forest changed to a mature deciduous forest and the walking became easy.  The stream has not falls that I could find although I didn\u2019t follow it to the end.  Instead, I did a beeline for that rocky outcrop.  Found it with no problem but was disappointed, as the outcrop does not offer much for climbing potential\u20265.5 perhaps even less.  The view is quite nice though and a return trip while the leaves are in color would be fantastic.",
    "directions": "Highway  245 near Arisaig.  Turn on Maggee Rd.  Turn left on Avondale/ Ardness Rd.  It will become Drumglass McArras Brook Rd.  Park approximately here; N45.71390\u00b0 W62.19541\u00b0.  If you are able to fond an old woods road leading east, take it or follow my gps track to the remote valley.",
