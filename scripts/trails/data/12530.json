    "description": "In my endeavour to locate as many falls as possible in NS, I picked to follow this aptly named brook at a location where the topography looked good for some falls.  Setting off from the dirt road, there was a faint ATV trail that brought me to the lip of the ravine.  I descended the moderate slope into an open deciduous forest and met the stream after a long descent....Now which way to go? upstream or downstream?   Upstream I went and I did see some 6-7 ft falls but nothing very big or anything that would suggest why they named it Roaring!  However I didn't go all the way upstream so I may have missed something.  If this is the case please drop me a line!",
    "directions": "On the Wentworth collingwood Rd.  Turn on Webb Rd and then turn left on a Stephen Mtn Rd and after the second bridge park at the side and go to the stream at 45.599043, -63.653601",
