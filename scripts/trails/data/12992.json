    "description": "This trail is located in Gros Morne National Park.  You have the Tablelands on one side and the Long Range Mountains on the other.  A contrast of 2 worlds.  No real big climbs but sections of the trail can be fairly wet (muddy) after a rain.  Scenery is outstanding",
    "directions": "From the TCH at Deer Lake take Route 430 towards Bonne Bay.  Turn left onto Route 431 at Wiltondale.  Proceed to the Trout River pond day use area.",
