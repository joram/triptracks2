    "description": "This is the Highwood Pass on Hiway 40.  From June 15 - Dec 15, it is the highest paved road in Canada, from Dec. 15 - Jun 15, it is the highest paved road in Canada with a great big GATE across each end of it. In the spring, it is a common destination for bike riders of all shapes and sizes, from knobby MTBs to sleek Cerv\u00e9los, and even one fold-em-up.The winter has a lot of people skiing and snowshoeing along it and possibly making a loop with Pocaterra trail in the vicinity of Lookout / WhiskeyJack / etc.In the late spring, they typically have to plow the top of it to make it ready for cars, so you can do a gate-to gate of 54km each way for a weekend or two before the opening.  Even before it is plowed, many people do it but have to hoof through anywhere from 100 to 3,000m of snow.Other people will park at other places along Hiway 40 well before the gate, say back at K-village or even Canoe Meadows and make a Century out of it.The enclosed tracklog is from the North Gate to the Summit and back, 17.1km each way.  But you can certainly go on without a tracklog, it would be very difficult to get lost.",
    "directions": "North Gate:  West of Calgary to Hiway 40.  Drive South 50.0km, park at King Creek trailhead or possibly on the road side (not sure if that's legal).South Gate:  South of Calgary on Hiway 22 to Longview, AB.  Go West to the gate on the paved road on the N side of Longview at Highwood House.",
