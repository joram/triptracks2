    "description": "This is a way to get to a couple of waterfalls on Benvie Brook. It took me a couple of trips (and an older but better map) to find where the falls were located. \n \nThe first part is bushwacking through a logged area until you meet a dirt road. The logged area was replanted with fir trees and they are set pretty close to each other so if the trees are wet so will you be. There was some flagging tape from time to time but not enough to lead you all the way to the dirt road. \n \nThe forest around the brook is mature so most of the walking is easy excepts  where there has been some wind knockdowns (maybe from Juan???). Anyways the main fall is quite high and the pool at its base could be a good swimming hole.",
    "directions": "Take Highway 224 past Middle Musquodoboit, past Kent (the town) and turn left on Benvie Mtn Rd.  Drive approximately 550m and park your car.  Head into the woods on the right in a NNE direction until you hit a dirt road.  Follow it to a bridge over the brook and follow the brook upstream for 200m to see all the falls (second to last one is about 45 feet)",
