    "description": "A small brook gives rise to a very nice looking waterfall a few hundred meres from a highway near Noel.  Most people will drive by this brook without giving it a second glance.  However if you take the time to follow it by bushwacking on the eastern side, you will soon come up to a nice and unexpected 25ft fall.",
    "directions": "Highway 216.  Turn right on Burncoat Rd (across from Singer Rd).  Park after driving 250m and bushwack heading west. The falls are at N45\u00b0 17' 13.4\" W63\u00b0 48' 14.9\"",
