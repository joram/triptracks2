    "description": "Off the side of highway 14 lies the slough brook.   You don't see it from the road and if you push your way through the mixed forest and down the moderate slope, you find yourself staring at a series of small falls or cascades.  this is a good hike to add whren you go visit the shea Brook fall close by in Canaan.",
    "directions": "Highway 14 almost to the Cannan Rd.  the cascades are at; N44.65478 W64.28768",
