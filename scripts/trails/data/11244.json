    "description": "On a long drive on the TCH in Cape Breton Island, you sometimes need to stretch your legs and get away from the tourists.  This short hike takes you down an old woods road before you descend into a moderately steep valley tpo see a couple of waterfalls.  All of this within 5min of leaving the TCH in Whycocomagh.  The slope before hitting the falls are covered by smaller conifers but the bottom of the ravine has some nice hardwood specimens. The biggest fall might be about 12ft and it looks like there might have been a dam in place a long time ago.",
    "directions": "TCH to Whycocomagh, Turn on Whycocomagh Mountain Rd and drive until you see a dirt road to your right.  Follow it to a metal fence and then straight down into the ravine to the falls.",
