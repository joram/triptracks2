    "description": "Traverse of the Mt. Wesley ridge on the north side of Cameron Lake. We did this point to point, leaving one car at the beach at the east end of Cameron Lake, and taking the second car and parking at Cathedral Grove. A full loop can be made by returning on the old train tracks on the north side of the lake. The trail is relatively easy to follow. Trail is in much better shape at the east and west ends. The section between Mt. Wesley and Salmon Hill is flagged in but is nary more than a game trail. Easy enough to follow the flagging. The trail crosses some quad trail, and uses small sections, but for the most part there is singletrack bypassing the quad trails. A friend and I did this in 2:50, running the easy parts, and stopping for a few photos here and there.",
