    "description": "A very special area in South West Alberta that has an interesting story and some very serious (and literally tree hugging) fans.  The trails as included in the GPS data are gleaned from the excellent book, \"The Whaleback - A Walking Guide\" by Bob Blaxley.\r\rGenerally speaking, the WhaleBack is basically 100 square km of roadless, rare montane landscape.  It is open to recreational users (including in the past; OHV / ATVs, and hunting) and allowed random camping.  It also includes a walk up to your average Alberta forestry lookout on the South West side.\r\rClose to the Oldman River and numerous creeks and streams, ridges and peaks, the Whaleback is an area that lets you explore to your heart's content.",
    "directions": "There are a number of Trailheads, see GPS data for more information.  Basically the area is North of Croswnest Pass / Hiway 3; West of Hiway 22; South of Hiway 532, and East of the Forestry Trunk Road (Hiway 940).",
