    "description": "Approximately 1100 m elevation gain. Lots of climbing especially for thew first few kilometers from the trailhead. Once up on the ridge lots of up and down lesser peaks. Can stop and turn back at any point but there is a rock cairn that is a popular turn around point, some scrambling is required past that point if you wish to continue.",
    "directions": "From Calgary Head west on hwy 1 and take the turnoff for hwy 40 K country trail. Take the first left after the wasootch sign on the right hand side after the Barrier lake info center. Take the trail behind the dark green trail sign (the ridge hike is not listed on the sign).",
