    "description": "This peak was named for Sir Donald, who drove the last spike in the national railway.  Built by the CPR, in soon became used as an access route for mountaineers. The trail is easy at the beginning (also starts at Illecillewaet Campground) and crosses an avalanche shoot that you will notice.  A few hundred metes past the junctions with Vaux Glacier Creek, the Sir Donald trail continues straight ahead.  Perley Rock Trail goes to the right at this junction. The trail ends in a basin.  3 hours out, 2 hours back. Be careful near the Vaux Glacier.  There is GPS data attached to this trail (see \"download GPS\"), which if loaded into your GPS can help you find route points.\r\n\r",
