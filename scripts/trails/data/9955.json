    "description": "Easy hiking trail  for the whole family, through woods. The red loop is about 4.5km long although the sign says 6.5km...The red loop trail is set on a mixture of single track, woods road and tav trail.  There is little elevation gain or loss.  Lots of signing to get your on your way as there are also a blue, purple and yellow loop.  There are a couple of wooden bridge to go over.  Part of the trail is on a gravel road which is a petty but I will be back to do the blue and yellow loops.",
    "directions": "Starts at Black Rock Community Center in Black Rock, 11 kms north of Berwick.",
