    "description": "Nice MTB route - we've been the only one on this end of August day in 2007. Alone with exception of some brown bears and very high vegetation.\nStarting at Upper Trail Lake. Pass the west shore of Upper Trail lake. Follow slightly ascending on clear visible hiking trail. Nice passages with nice panorama and passages with extreme high grass vegetation.\nBe aware of Cow Parsnip, it hurts and be aware of the bears in this region.\nWe biked up to Johnson Lake returned on the nice roller coaster back to the starting point.",
    "directions": "Have a look at track - near Moose Pass - mile 32.7 Seward Hwy.",
