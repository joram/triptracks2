    "description": "Trail explores the Manitoba \"desert\".  The sand dune portion of the trail consists of wind-patterned sand dunes, cacti and high temperatures.  The devil's punchbowl portion leads through medows and forests.The trails are moderately demanding with level stretches and a few steep slopes. The \"steepest\" have stairs and platforms to help you climb and to protect the fragile layer of vegetation.Tips:1. Come prepared with proper walking shoes, a hat, sunscreen and drinking water.  The map indicates where water is available, however there are signs posted by the water pumps indicating that the water should be boiled prior to drinking.  Carry lots of water with you!2. On hot summer days, avoid the trails at midday; plan a morning or evening hike.  The temperature of the sand can reach +50C!3. Beware of poison ivy.4. Bring a camera with suitable protection from flying dust and sand. Website and Trail Map:http://www.gov.mb.ca/conservation/parks/popular_parks/spirit_sands/index.html",
