    "description": "This relaxing stroll travels through forested areas, along wetlands and over a few rocky scrambles before reaching a cobble-stoned beach. The highest point of the trail provides a panoramic view of Manitoulin Island, Georgian Bay and the La Cloche Mountains.The trail continues along the wave-washed granite shoreline of scenic Killarney Bay, part of the North Channel.There are many spots for a swim on a hot summer?s day, and great photo opportunities exist along the entire trail. The Difficulty:Moderate. Most of the trail you?ll be walking over smooth, rolling, granite.There is one scenic look-out where you must climb up a granite ridge and then on the return, carefully negotiate down the rocky ledge. A few cobble-stone beaches require careful footwork.",
    "directions": "In Killarney,  ON,  a ferry service is available for a fee, at the Sportsman's Inn or Killarney Mountain Lodge,  to cross the Killarney Channel to the trail head.",
