    "description": "This is the Black Tusk Snowshoe Trail at the Whistler Olympic Center.  It's not very well marked, and we were breaking a new trail after some rain so it wasn't easy to navigate.  This trek took us about 2 hrs. See the attached GPS.",
    "directions": "Starts south of the Lodge at the \"Whistler Olympic Center\". Map at right has \"expand\" which provides street map and directions, compare with GPS track on map for additional directions, or add starting address in directions form below this text.",
