    "directions": "Travel Hwy 16 west of Terrace, BC pass Fishermans Park, over the Kalum River Bridge and take a right immediately after the gas station onto the Kalum FSR (Forest Service Road). Follow the brown directional signs for 13-14 kilometres to the Pine Lake turn off which will appear on your left (1/2 drive). Close to Pine Lake, a lake appears on your left - do not be fooled this is a nice picnic site referred to as Glory Hole. Continue past Glory Hole on the gravel road to the Pine Lake turn off which is poorly mark with a small sign with Pine Lake on it. Turn here and continue down the narrow road for a short distance to the wilderness campsite.",
