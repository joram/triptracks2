    "description": "Sentry Mountain Hike Log, July 2nd, 2005 (Done as part of the 2005 Alberta Centennial Mountain Expedition).The Route:From the gravel pit, follow the dirt road and bear right around the first quarry. To access the ridge, continue along the gravel road that parallels Crowsnest Creek and follow it up the switchbacks. At the first switchback, we found a game trail heading through the forest towards the ridge. We chose to follow the game trail, rather than continuing up the road to the next quarry. There are game trails at the upper quarry as well, but some bushwhacking is required to find them, as I discovered on the way down. Going up through the forest, it took about an hour and a half to get above the tree line at a brisk pace. Above the tree line it was a moderate scramble with some difficult areas near the summit. The route is obvious and the ridge narrows towards the top with some exposure. The ridge has a couple of mounds that one can unsuspectingly ascend, only to discover a steep drop of 10 to 20 feet, requiring one to climb down carefully, or alternatively backtrack and traverse around the obstacle. With a bit of route-finding, most difficult sections were avoided, except for one pitch near the top. There were interesting views of Crowsnest and Tecumseh to the North; Chinook Peak to the South; as well as the giant pile of yellow sulfur at the industrial plant below.Inclement Weather!This was less of a hike than a G.I. Joe commando assault on  Sentry Mountain. It was our second consecutive Saturday attempt, our last try being rained out. The weather forecast called for showers at noon, and starting out under sunny skies at 9:30, we felt pretty confident that we could be at the peak before the precipitation would arrive. So it was that we started our hike with one common goal in mind: get to the summit quickly, weather-be-damned!Most of our group made it to the peak in less than 3 hours. At the summit it was obvious that stormy weather was on its way (see photos) but others in our group were lagging behind, so we ate our lunches and used the rock cairn at the top as a windbreak. It was strange to be under a patch of sunshine, as rain clouds were passing by the mountains on either side of us. We could feel the moisture in the air and it was obvious we were going to get wet, so we waited and speculated amongst ourselves as to how much time we had before the rain caught up to us. Finally, the last of member of our hiking party arrived, bearing with him the Alberta Centennial canister. We secured it to the rock cairn without any fanfare, merely signing our names in the new logbook and retrieving the old logbook to send to the Crowsnest Pass Museum. Incidentally, the first entry in the old Sentry log was made in 1991 by none other than Alan Kane, author of \u00c2?Scrambles in the Canadian Rockies' - an excellent reference for this hike, by the way! The old logbook was quite deteriorated due to past soakings and some of the pages were illegible, although there were many humorous entries that were there for us to chuckle at.As we quickly placed rocks around the Alberta Centennial canister, we started to feel a few drops of rain.  To the west there were many ominous dark grey clouds so we immediately began our descent. After 20 minutes or so we saw a bolt of lightening to the west and tried our best to descend below the exposed part of the mountain before the storm arrived. We got good and soaked and received a good scare by being up so high in the mountains in the middle of an electricity storm. Never a good idea!- Trevor Helwig.  July 2nd, 2005P.S. To echo a sentiment noted several times in the old logbook, \"Thank you Alan Kane!\".Level of Difficulty: An easy hike for the first half, followed by a couple kilometers of moderate scrambling with a single pitch of class 4 near the summit.Disclaimer: This is a scramble. Be aware that scrambling can injure or kill you. Be prepared, know your limits and make sure somebody knows where you're going.

    "directions": "Turn off Highway 3 at the access road for the gravel pit just past Crowsnest Lake (see map). Park away from the barricade so you don't block traffic. An alternate approach is to drive to the next turnoff and park 1.5 kms up the road, which parallels Crowsnest Creek. This would save time and avoid the first quarry but requires a creek crossing. The water level was quite high due to recent rains so we decided to hike from the gravel pit, which was not in operation.There are other routes to ascend Mt. Sentry, although the western approach that we followed was the most obvious. Others in our party had ascended from the northeast ridge 3 weeks previously. They started at Crowsnest Lake but had descended by the route that we took today. The northeastern approach is a more difficult scramble and passes close to a number of caves, which are unfortunately not easily accessible. Proper climbing equipment would likely be needed to get to the caves.",
