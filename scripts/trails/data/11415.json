    "description": "This is a one-way track for the hike from the trail head to where we stayed on the edge of Alice Lake.  We stayed for 3 nights and took a number of day hikes from our base camp.  Wonderful lake to swim in if you like cold water.  We had fish 2 nights for dinner thanks to my expert fisherman son-in-law.",
    "directions": "South from Stanley on Hwy 75 to the Pettit Lake Trail head.",
