    "description": "NTS Map: 092G06This section of the Baden-Powell trail is recommended by Peggy Moir, who has contributed a number of relatively flat or easy hikes, ideal for seniors or others who like to cruise.The trail passes along the shoulders of Grouse Mountain, and on to Lynn Canyon Park.  Other trails intersection the BP in this section; watch for orange markers and stay on the trail.  We'll provide a GPS track as soon as someone donates it.  As you pass the northern end of Mountain Highway watch for bunchberry which grows plentiful here. At Lynn Canyon Park stop in at the Ecology center with its awesome displays of local plant and wildlife.  Washrooms are in the park.",
