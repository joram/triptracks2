    "description": "Berry Hill\nThe Berry Hill trail is located just north of the town of Rocky Harbour in Gros Morne National Park. The trail begins at the Berry Hill campground. With an elevation of 139 meters over a 3/4km the climb is quite steep in places and is sure to have even the fittest hiker huffing and puffing by the top. Luckily there are benches and rest stops at regular intervals along the path.\nBerry Hill itself is a low rock knob that was an island when the area was covered by ocean at the end of the last ice age. You can find polished rocks along its flanks that were shaped by ocean waves 10 000 years ago.\nThe view from the top is certainly worth the effort. On a clear day you can see some of the parks most prominent features such as; Gros Morne Mountain, Lobster Cove Lighthouse, and the Tablelands. You also get a great panoramic view of the extensive coastal lowlands and the Long Range Mountains.\nRyan Young\nNewfoundland Editor\nJanuary 2006",
