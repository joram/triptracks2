    "description": "After a gentle climb through rainforest the trail crosses Asulkan Brook, and then turns left for the climb up a switchback trail.  Hikers should be careful in determining if conditions are acceptable for getting to the crest.  Be careful in choosing a route if attempted (2255m), as the ridge is actually an ar\u00eate.  Great views. 3.5 hrs is uphill, 2 hrs back.  Trailhead is at Illecillewaet Campground.",
