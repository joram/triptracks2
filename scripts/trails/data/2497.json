    "description": "This is a short loop trail that wraps around Pink Lake in Gatineau Park.  The trail is well maintained and easy to follow.  Pink Lake is a typical shield lake. The trail goes up and down a lot but none of the climbs will pose any problems for anyone able to walk.",
    "directions": "From the south entrance of Gatineau Park follow the parkway about five kilometers heading northwest.  The trail is clearly marked.  Turn right and drive into the trail head parking lot.",
