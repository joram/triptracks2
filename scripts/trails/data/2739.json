    "description": "This is the first half of the trail. It's a leisurely trail for 4.3 kms (3 miles) from the Artist Point TH to the point where we turned around. Start at 1550 m el, high point is 1700 m, low point is 1530, beautiful views. We turned back due to the thick fog that made going the distance (9 kms each way) too dangerous.\nHope to do the full trip and upload the full GPS data summer of 2007 (keep posted)",
    "directions": "Take WA state highway from Bellingham eastward to the end of the road up Mt Baker to Artist Point parking lot (approx 70 miles (100 kms)). From Sumas BC, hway 547 southeast to hway 542, then eastward as described above.",
