    "description": "My reasons for visiting this stream were two folds.  One was that there was some indications of waterfalls and 2) the stream was bisecting a rocky section of dolomite stone and I was curious to see if that had led to formation of caves.  Without leaving you in suspense;  yes on one but no on two.  From the dam on the lake you follow the stream down through a mixed forest.  On the edge of the stream the forest is dominated by evergreen and there is almost nothing growing under the canopy so traveling is easy.  A main fall of about 6ft is located about 200m from the road with some smaller falls and rapids located on the next 300m of the stream.   There are a few exposed section of dolomite which are very different looking rock then exists in the rest of the stream.  Unfortunately the stream has not carved out any openings in the rock as is the case on Dollar Lake stream.",
