    "description": "Again, I was in the area of Joggins and wanted to explore for some falls.  This cove looked like it could have an interesting feature.  A shortish bushwack by the stream needed at a nice looking 12 ft fall.  The brook then becomes tidal and meanders in a nice looking mudflat.  I also saw a sign by the road stating that this was now a Nature Reserve.  On the way back, I found an ATV trail which took me back to the road.",
