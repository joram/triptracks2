    "description": "Trail begins at Tinhorn Creek Winery building. There are posted markers indicate the route however more would be of assistance in some places. I found a useful map at the \"I\"nformation center in Oilver.\nFollow marker trail then take the detour to the Stamp Mill Ruins return the junction and head north through the cattle ranch about 3km to a gate. (there needs to be a marker here). The path eventually leads into the creek (there is a creek fording required - it's not deep) and from there you come to the road. \nTake Old Golf Course Road back to 123rd ave and eventually meet the Tinhorn Winery access road.\nWildflowers are abundant in season (end of May). Some great views from the trail. Plus you can end the hike with a tasting at the winery,",
    "directions": "Hi way 97 south of Oliver access to Tin Horn Creek winery is No 7 Road (also 328 ave). (it's marked for both the trail and Winery)",
