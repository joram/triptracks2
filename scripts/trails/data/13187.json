    "description": "This branch of Mill Creek Brook doesn?t appear on the 1:50 000 topo.  However, it hides a very nice 15ft fall.  The walk is an easy bushwack of no more than 5min from the road.  The brook looses a lot of elevation at the fall but most of it is a cascade type.",
    "directions": "Highway 358 towards Scots Bay.  Turn right on Stewart Mountain Rd.  Park where a logging road appears on the left N45.23048\u00b0 W64.38663\u00b0.  Fall is approximately at N45.23243\u00b0 W64.38658\u00b0.",
