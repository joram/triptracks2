    "description": "This is a moderately difficult trail in Yoho National Park (B.C.) to a nice quiet lake. Quiet because very few people seem to hike in Yoho, possibly because it's small and right on the Trans-Canada. We did it in mid-August and the trail and the lake were all ours. The trail climbs almost all the way but is not really difficult. \r\nAbout 2km in, there is a branch right to a lookout on Paget Peak (difficult). \r\nReturn the way you came.\r\nIn winter please check the Avaluator\r\n(Online Trip Planner) rating is: \r\n Complex.  \r\nSee more trip planner route details here.\r",
    "directions": "Trailhead is at the Wapta Lake picnic area on the north side of Hwy 1, 11km east of Field, B.C.",
