    "description": "Probably Peter Lougheed Park is the favorite place for local calgary XC skiers. It is close (compared with Banff NP), lots of trails, nice mountain view, long season for skiing early from Nov till next April and etc. This loop is the very popular circuit for most XC skiers. Most of the trail is blue and green, and only very short part is black. There are lots of spectacular views along the trail!",
    "directions": "Take Hwy 1 west out of town to Hwy 40. Go south on Hwy 40 for approx 56km. Turn right just before the winter gate. Follow the Kananaskis Lakes Trail until you see the sign for the Peter Lougheed Park Visitor Center.",
