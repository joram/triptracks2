    "description": "This is a well known fall in the vicinity of St Peters.  A long time ago, a fish ladder was constructed on one side of the falls.  In 20202, there is a new fish ladder but it seems that people enjoyed the older fish ladder as it was open an smaller than the concrete structure in place now.",
    "directions": "Take Loch Lomond Rd towards the loch.  Turn left on a dirt road a few hundred metres before reaching Barren Hill Rd.  Drive the dirt road to its conclusion at a metal gate.  Park and the fall are just ahead",
