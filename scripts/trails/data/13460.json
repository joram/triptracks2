    "description": "There aren't many brooks I haven't followed in the valley looking for hidden waterfalls.  This is one of them. Ben's Brook flows into the Bay of Fundy just east of Margaretsville.  To reach this fall it is paramount that you look at a tide table.  go for a time 2 hours after high tide to give you plenty of time to reach the fall and come back safely.  \n\nI started at an old cemetery and dropped down the impressive ravine created by Stronach Brook. followed the brook to the shore.  Here I turned to the east and followed the impressive cliffs. Lots of ice for climbing on this shore.  Lots of minerals for the rock hounders too!  After walking the shoreline 1km you come to a small cove with Ben's Brook flowing about 25ft straight down to the sea floor.  Some small sea caves behind and to the side of the fall.",
