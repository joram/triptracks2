    "description": "NTS Map: 082J14\n Dateline 2008: Yes, Fortress Is Closed, Likely For Good\nIt should be a reasonable place to launch a few hikes and other backcountry delights but watch for Avalance danger.\nNewly enclosed GPS data shows a path for getting up to the top from where you can access Fortress Lake.\n----------------\n\nWith just over 935 skiable acres on some of the sweetest snow conditions in the Rockies Fortress Mountain runs off two mountain sides and up another mountain on the backside. The mountain is serviced by four, newly renovated lifts ( Triple Chair, Double Chair, and 2 T-bars) and has a terrain breakdown of 20% beginner, 50% intermediate and 30% advanced. \nClick below for Ski Report and Weather Forcast:\n\n\nFortress Mountain Ski Resort Web Link",
