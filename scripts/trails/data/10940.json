    "description": "County marked trail that travels the length of South Poway.It's mostly a wide dirt track. Beware look out for rattle snakes.It's up an down hill frequently provides great views and where as the most popular trails in the area can be crowded, this trail is generally not crowded. I did in about 5 different segments.It does appear in places locals would like to keep people away as there some unofficial No trespassing signs at at least one convenient access point. The county sheriff lives close to one and he indicated signs could be ignored.",
    "directions": "You are mostly on you own on the this one. Find a parking spot and look for a trail up the hill that connects. One place that was convenient was the North wood church parking lot off Poway Rd",
