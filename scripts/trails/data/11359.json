    "description": "This is a hike to the bottom of two gorges and ultimately two waterfalls; Albion and Buttermilk.  From the parking lot, follow the trail a couple of hundred metres until the slopes look suitable.  If you go down towards the fall too early, there is a 40 ft escarpment at the toe of the slope you won?t be able to navigate. Once at the edge of the stream, go up and see the Albion fall which seems like more a a tier kind of fall but it?s difficult to  say when there is a lot of snow and ice.  Afterwards just stay in the valley and follow it down until another valley comes up to your left.  The forest in the valley or gorge is a mature deciduous so it?s easy to navigate.  You will probably  see a concrete structure with all kinds of steam coming up?no too sure what this is.  The secondary valley is also easy to walk and ultimately you come the 30m fall which is nice except  for the roadway and graffiti you see at the top.  Nevertheless it?s well worth the effort.",
    "directions": "Stone Church Rd.  turn on Pritchard St and then left on Mud St which become Brow Mountain Rd.  You will see a parking lot.",
