    "description": "These are two separate roadside hikes to do check out some unexpected beautiful waterfalls.  Off Morrison road near Oban Cape Breton lies a few hidden drops.  for both look at the gps track and when you are driving look for some small unassuming brooks crossing the road.  In both cases you can see that on the south side of the road, the terrain becomes vertical quite fast giving rise to the waterfalls that range between 10- 25 ft.  Only go after rain though.",
    "directions": "In St Peters, Take Oban Rd.  Drive to its conclusion and turn right on Morrison Rd.  Brooks to check are 1.3 and 2.3km of the intersection.",
