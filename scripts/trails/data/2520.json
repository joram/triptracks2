    "description": "NTS Map: 082J10Don't expect to keep your feet dry on this one. While there is an unofficial trail leading to the lake it is very wet and part of the trail acts as a drainage after heavy rainfall/ spring melt. There is also a river crossing right at the beginning, sans bridge, so bring sandals. We avoided the trail most of the way so some route finding is necessary to circumnavigate the bogs. There is a nice payoff once you reach the lake nestled at the base of the Elk Range. Lots of cutthroat trout that are mostly too small for lures are easily taken on a fly. There are also spots to camp on the shore but go when the weather is cool to avoid the bugs.",
    "directions": "The trailhead is not marked. Use the GPS coordinates for this hike. If you don't have GPS park at the end of the guard rail 4.3km South of Lipsett day use area. You can easily see the log spanning the first creek crossing.(Editor's note: Trailhead is 26.7km S of the gate on Hiway 40 @ Peter Lougheed Park turnoff)",
