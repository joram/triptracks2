    "description": "This is one of those waterfalls hike I forgot to post.  Luckily I decided to look at it again and instead of finding my original fall (which I did), I found two more falls for a total of three falls in a relatively shortish bushwhack along this brook.Most people end up in Baxters Harbour to see a variety of waterfalls (Black Hole, Coby Irving etc) but this unassuming brook has a few nice beauties if you are willing to do so light bushwhacking.   Basically just follow the brook upstream from the bridge.  The last fall to see is actually the nicest.  It plunges down about 12 feet into a narrow corridor of rock!",
    "directions": "Drive to Baxters Harbour and take Old Baxters Mill Rd heading west and park on by the bridge over the brook at  45\u00b013'34.06\"N,  64\u00b031'42.54\"W",
