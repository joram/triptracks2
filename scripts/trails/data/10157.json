    "description": "Devil's Punchbowl is a former Provincial Park, the description from the province's website:\n\"This trail of easy walking (less than 2 km in length) is located between Rte. 254 (Rattenbury Rd.) and South Granville. Interpretive signs explain the odd name given to the trail. The path follows what was originally the Old Princetown Road to enable overland communications between Charlottetown and Princetown. Hikers will find themselves walking through a mixed woodlot and for the more imaginative, it is a trip back to the days of the ox sleds.\"\nThe local watershed group has a tree nursery at the site.  There are two wooded trails that are well groomed and marked, and then you can also walk the old road as described.",
    "directions": "Off the Rattenbury Road, you will see a homemade sign, take the dirt road till you get to a fork, then veer to the left where you will find a small parking lot.",
