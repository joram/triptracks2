    "description": "NTS Map: 011I06\nThe Secret Snake is one of a series of PEI trails maintained by a group of local mountain Bikers. \nBordering Brookvale ski park, the trail lies in the heart of some of PEI's steeper terrain.\nRight from the start, you must complete a leg burning ascent which takes you into the arena of \ntwisty turns and technical riding. Occasionally the route spills out onto log roads, but no sooner \nthan you find yourself on one, does the trail lead you off into the woods again.One stop-worthy \nlandmark includes \"Lightning tree\", where a cleeved tree carcus lies next to the trail, reminding \nsome bikers, who were pondering a ride one stormy weekend, that it be best to stay clear of the \nwoods in a lightning storm! \nThe trail lacks markers, making a GPS essential for snowshoeing come winter. In the summer, the \npath is more obvious, at least to most people. Also come summer, GPS reception gets pretty \nsketchy. Rated difficult for route finding.\nThis trail isn't that far from the Nordic center area of Brookvale, so this little gem of a trail is easily \nincluded to make a day of it on the mountain bike or snowshoes.",
    "directions": "On the highway just before Brookvale Provincial ski park, there is a small dirt road leading into the \nwoods next to the parking lot.",
