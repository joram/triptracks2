    "description": "Trail starts in trees just off the hwy.  Very Scenic route.  Can be a little muddy but not too bad. Has equal amounts of ups and downs with flats.  Just enough to get your heart rate up, then a little break.  Will do this trail again.  Very nice when you make it in the loop.  Prairie Creek Trail is 5.7 km. Then we took the Prairie Link which is 2.9km. finishing on Powderface CreekTrail 2.8km. Comes back out where you park.\nEd's note: For a longer ride, see \"PowderCreek PrairieCreek Loop\" in trailpeak.com  (trail#1183)",
    "directions": "Go through Bragg Creek to Kananaskis country. turn right (West) on hwy 66 to Powderface paking lot.  Walk out to hwy and just before bridge walk down the hill. Trail starts here.",
