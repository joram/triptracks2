    "description": "This is  hike to a mostly unknown waterfall on top of the North Mountain just north of Sheffield Mills.   You can actually see the brook flowing by the side of the road leading you to the top of the mountain.  You can follow it up after the quarry to the fall or follow i=t from the top down to the fall instead.I decided to follow it from the top of the mountain down.  its an easy hike at first through some fields that have been left to fallow.  Once the forest closes in you are only a few minutes from the cascading waterfall.  A word of warning; only go at spring melt or after a rainfall as the brook doesn't drain a large area.",
    "directions": "In sheffield Mills, Continue on Black Hole Brook Rd.  At the top turn left on Gospel Woods Rd.  Turn left then on Brow of the Mountain Rd and drive 350m to the culvert.",
