    "description": "The cross country ski trail into Lake O'Hara is on the road that the buses travel on in the summer.  From the parking lot, the road heads up a long hill before flattening out around the midway point.  After that there are a number of additional hills to climb before reaching the Lake at the top.  On a clear days, the views are magnificent all the way in.  If you are heading to the Elizabeth Parker hut, there is a trail that heads off to the right at the Le Relais day use area which is just before the lake.  Depending on your fitness level and skiing ability it could take from 2.5 - 5 hours to ski in, and normally takes around 1.5 hours to ski out.",
    "directions": "The trail head is easily found as it is just off the Trans Canada highway on the south side.  Look for signs on the highway for the Lake O'Hara parking lot.  It is just across the Alberta / BC border, on the BC side - no more than a 15 minute drive from Lake Louise.",
