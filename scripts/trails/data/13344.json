    "description": "Here is a fall I explored a long time ago and I guess I forgot to trailpeak it!  This is a hike on some logging roads and then some bushwacking to two different falls on a small brook near Coldstream.  The walk on the road is not very memorable and then the bushwack was in some small areas not super pleasant with lots of closely packed evergreens.  But with any luck those have grown and are now more spaced apart or find another route to the stream or maybe someone cut a trail?\n\nThe fall I found was a slider type fall not super impressive but a fellow explorer Andrew Hooper followed my picture and actually found a better waterfall just a few hundred metres upstream of mine.  The lesson here\u2026never give up, don\u2019t turn around, you never know ..a hidden gem might be just ahead.  Thanks Andrew for letting me know what I had missed!",
