    "description": "A short hike just off the Trans Canada Highway to two falls.  This is a really short hike of about 200m on a well-established unofficial trail.  Looks like this area is used by locals to go for a dip or have a bonfire.  The upper fall is about 5ft and the lower one about 10 foot. The rocks around the lower fall and the large plunge pool looks promising for some jumping?although you would have to survey water depth before an attempt.",
    "directions": "TCH turn on Maple Brook Rd and continue straight through intersection.  Park at  45\u00b0 48.498'N, 61\u00b0 17.876'W",
