    "description": "There are a number a nice little bridges all the way up this hike, the largest at the beginning.  The trail meanders through the trees and along the creek most of the way up, not much for views until you reach Lillian Lake.  It is a gradual but continuous uphill after the 4th or 5th bridge and is approximately 6.5km, 460m to Lillian Lake and another 1.5km, 155m to the Lower Galatea Lake.  All in all a nice hike, but wear proper footware as the last bit up to the lake has a lot of loose rock.",
    "directions": "Head into K country from highway 1, continue to the Galatea/Lilian Lake trailhead, about 3 miles past the golf course (signed) and turn right into the parking lot.",
