    "description": "In order to view this fall you will have top bushwack about 500m or so.  there is an old logging road that takes you close but after you park, aim for the river and follow it downstream to a set of three distinct falls.  The woods around the river can be thick so if the water is low the best bet is to walk along the side of the river.",
    "directions": "The start of the logging road is at  45.430283\u00b0, -61.432627\u00b0 and the falls are at  45.434903\u00b0, -61.451740\u00b0.",
