    "description": "Wonderful views on this trail which leads into B.C. Big beautiful mountains many able to scramble up.  The beautiful Mount Ida and Mount Sir Alexander tower over you.  At Kakwa Lake you can head to Jarvis Lakes or Cecilia Lake. This trail is best done in a dry year.This is one of my most favourite rides and one of the best things is no motorized vehicles. They are allowed on the other hand on the Trail To Kakwa falls. This is a very secluded back country ride, plan to do this trip over 4 days it can be done in two but there are just too many places to explore.  There are also fossils to see as well as dinosaur footprints.",
    "directions": "Same directions As the Kakwa Trail except at km 17.5 the trail to the lake is right, there are about 3 places to turn, take the most travelled one.",
