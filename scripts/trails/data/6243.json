    "description": "The only hard part about this trail is finding where to start. The name is VERY fitting this lake is very hidden, but can be a very fun outing when visiting or camping in the area. After an hour hike (at a very leisurely pace) we reached \"little lost lake\" , there was a tire swing, a small boat, tons of fish jumping out on the water, and great trail signs. Enjoy exploring the area, or do a quick hike in and out.  1.5km each way.",
    "directions": "Finding the trail head is the tricky part after that following trail signs is easy and you can't get lost. Going north from Valemount, BC on highway 5 exit east (right, towards Jasper) onto highway 16 (Yellowhead). Keep an eye out for a small rest stop on the south side of the highway (not the truck weigh station) where you can park, this is approximately one km east of the highway 5 - 16 junction. After parking, cross the road (so you are walking on the north side of hwy 16). Walk east and keep an eye out for trails across the ditch to the north of the hwy16. The start of the trail is marked by a sign saying (I think) \"Little Lost Lake\" but it is hidden by some branches and leaves and may be hard to find while driving past. Once on the trail you can't get lost, there are excellent trail markers and signs. ENJOY",
