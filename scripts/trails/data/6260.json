    "description": "The Stony Squaw summit trail starts and ends with a bit of road riding - about half an hour of uphill on paved switchback to the parking lot at the base of Mt.Norquay, and then about an hour of fairly technical singeltrack climb up to the summit totalling about 700meters of ascent over 8k to the top. A few twists and turns through some scenic transition trails at the top, and then you're into some long flowing downhill before you cut back across the face of the hill back towards the highway. Lots of gravel, rocks and roots will keep you busy no matter what speed you want to ride it; fun to ride fast or more leisurely. Inexperienced riders will not enjoy this trail at all, however intermediate riders will find a great challenge, and more expert riders will not be bored.",
    "directions": "Park directly off Highway One at the Banff / Norquay exit. Bike up the road to the Mt. Norquay parking lot, trailhead is well marked with a sign.",
