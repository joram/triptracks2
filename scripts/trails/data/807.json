    "description": "NTS Map: 082j15\r\nA sweet new trail on Moose Mt. Rolling and flowy in places with some very nice built stuff including drops and teeters. A nice valley bottom run weaving from side to side on some nice side hill berms and a high speed finish to a nice drop. A blast to ride over and over.",
    "directions": "Ride or shuttle to the top parking lot on Moose Mt. out at Bragg Creek. Ride up the road past the gate for about 200 meters it drops in on the left.",
