    "description": "This little unnamed brook to the north of Stillwater crosses highway 7 in two different branches and the area downstream of both branches contain a surprisingly high number of scenic falls. However better go after a rainfall as the brook doesn't drain a a large area.  I names it after one of the only people in NS who can still send me some cool little hidden gems to check out.  Christopher Sinclair is exactly like me...spending a lot of time outdoors checking out stuff that no one else does and finding some really cool hidden gems.",
    "directions": "Highway 7 towards Lochiel Lake from Sherbrooke.  The brook crosses the highway at N45\u00b0 13' 40.7\" W62\u00b0 00' 38.0\".  Follow it downstream to the falls....",
