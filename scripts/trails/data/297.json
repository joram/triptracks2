    "description": "Crawford Trails  \r\nTrail length: 3km \r\nLevel: Captain Nemo: difficult \r\nRiddler: Most Difficult \r\nRating: both trails 3/5 \n\r\nThese trails can be ridden up or shuttled.  To shuttle, locate the Kettle Valley Railway - Myra Canyon Trestles parking lot on your city of Kelowna map \r\nand drive up to the parking lot after leaving a car at the top of Svaboda.  \r\n\r\nThere is an exceptional Google Earth rotatable and zoomable view (see trail options), and you can download GPS data into your own GPS to help you stay on the trail.  Can't help you with the bears though.\r\n\r\nYou take the railway bed away from the parking lot towards the trailheads.  The second trail on your right is Captain Nemo this heads down to The Riddler \r\nand whole whack of trails from there.  You can find your way down by taking trails to the left or the right, they all work there way back to your other car under the power lines.  For more detail pick up a free map from  Cyclepath or Gerrick Cycle.",
