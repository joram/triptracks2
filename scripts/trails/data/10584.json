    "description": "This is probably the 2nd most used path system in Calgary (behind the Bow River pathways in the Downtown area).  The trip is a complete circle around the Glenmore Reservoir.  Pretty flat except for the initial hill down to river level.  You are within 50 metres of the water most of the time.  Seems that about 60% of users are on bikes, 10% on roller blades and the rest on foot.  Lots of runners like this because it is a good training distance.  There are almost no road crossings (1 through a parking lot at Heritage Park and one where the path is a quiet street in Eagle Ridge subdivision).  The section that is beside Glenmore Trail has lots of traffic noise but the view of the water is nice.\r\rI like to start it at the south end of 37th Street S.W. but there are probably a dozen different places to start into the circuit.  This is technically part of the Elbow River pathway system (Glenmore Reservoir is a man made lake resulting from a dam of the Elbow River).  If you start where I start then about 1/2 way through you can stop at the Glenmore Landing shopping centre to get a snack at McDonalds, the grocery store or maybe even a burger and beer at the restaurant with the outdoor patio.\r",
    "directions": "As this is a circuit trail in an urban area there is no set trailhead.  It is accessible from many places.  I use the lot at the south end of 37th Street S.W. in Lakeview subdivision but it could also be accessed from any of the parking areas in North Glenmore Park, South Glenmore Park, Calgary Sailing Club area, Glenmore Landing shopping Centre, or Heritage Park parking area.\r\rFor a longer trip the Elbow River (which extends from close to Downtown Calgary all the way south into the Weaslehead loop) can be joined anywhere north of Glenmore Trail and used to get down into the Weaslehead loop.",
