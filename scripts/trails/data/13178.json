    "description": "The title says it all.  this is a hike to see the of gold mine working on the side of the St Marys River.  The walk is mainly on a logging road except at the end where you bushwack to the old workings.  The workings are really really cool but can be dangerous.  they are a combination of shafts and adits.  Adits are like tunnel while shafts are vertical holes!  There is even one spot where you can enter the adit and at one end of it there is a shaft.  I dropped a rock in there and it took a while to hit anything!  I'll let the video and picture do the rest of the description.",
