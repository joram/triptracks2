    "description": "This is a really short hike that will take you down a deep ravine in the North Mountains of the Annapolis Valley.  The trail is set on an old logging road which seems to be used by ATVs.  After The descent into the valley, you cross a stream.  There is a 12ft waterfall on the downstream side of the crossing.  The fall is set on an apron of rock that juts out of the stream bed making this an unusual looking waterfall.",
    "directions": "Highway221 in valley.  Turn on Pelton Mountain Rd.  Drive until you meet Sullivan Rd on your right.  Sullivan Rd on the left is the start of the trail that descends into the ravine and meets Chipman Brook.",
