    "description": "We hiked from the Skyline trail head at the Maligne Lake parking lot to Watchtower trail head. Overnight at Little Shovel and Watchtower campgrounds. Mosquitoes were vary bad at camps, but the scenery along the walk more than compensated.The alpine meadows between Little Shovel Pass and Big Shovel Pass were beautiful - full of a variety of flowers, marmots and surrounded by spectacular mountains.The slope on almost all of the trail is not difficult, going up to Big Shovel Pass and over Watchtower Pass were the exceptions.The first day is mostly in trees along a very good trail, and we made good time. Give way to the numerous trail runners. The second day was quite long, but had unbeatable scenery and better weather. The third day was a mix of a nice walk along the Watchtower River, fighting through alder/willows along an overgrown and muddy trail, and the final 5km to the road through a recent forest fire along a very nice trail.The only tricky navigation is on the Watchtower Trail. Ford the river immediately after leaving camp and watch for the yellow trail markers and rock cairns.",
    "directions": "Drive to Maligne Lake, across the bridge and park in the parking lot. Trail head is well marked.",
