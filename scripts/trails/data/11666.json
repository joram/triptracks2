    "description": "Marshall falls used to be taller before they flooded the area for the dam downstream.  There is however a small path to them which means it?s having lots of visitors.  The bottom of the fall looks very deep, but be very cautious if attempting to swim.  Close by there used to be a 45 ft fall from old maps but it is not flooded.",
    "directions": "Highway 374 N of Sheet Harbour.  Take dirt road after bridge at 45.056756, -62.505453.  Find the small trail after 100m or so down the road",
