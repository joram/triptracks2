    "description": "The hike to Raspberry Ridge provides great views in all directions. But effort is required as it ascends 645 m. 400 of which are in the last 850 meters. It's a classic lookout hike.You can see Mt. Burke to the east with the old Cameron Lookout.At about 3.7 km the trail leaves the gravel road and becomes steep. The old fireroad trail is still visible but is being reclaimed as a trail. Note we tried to find the access to Fireroad trail on the way down but could see it from the ridge.Raspberry Ridge is an active firelook, hike is described in Mike Potter's book of \"Fire Lookout Hikes'Beware of the wind once you go over the ridge.",
    "directions": "Trail head is unmarked gated road to the west off Forestry trunk road (940), 1.7 km north of entrance to Cataract creek campground and 11.4 km south of the three way junction of higways 40, 940 and 541.From the parking lot head west past the gate, then almost immediate take another right onto the snowmobile trail past another gate. Don't follow the road which looks like the easier route.",
