    "description": "Nice easy walk up, around and down (x2) Horth Hill in North Saanich.\nHorth Hill is a maze of walking trails through some wonderful wooded areas. This particular walk takes trails up to the top and back down again twice (different routes - total ascent 160 m.). From the summit (137m) you have a good view south down Saanich peninsula, across Saanich Inlet over to the Bamberton area. No facilites available on this route however there are pit toilets in the park on a different trail. Many other alternate trails exist in the park as well as several geocache sites.",
    "directions": "Head North from Victoria BC on the Pat Bay Highway. Before the ferry terminal turn onto Lands End Rd. and head west. Turn left onto Hedgerow Dr and follow it up to the top (deadend). Trail starts at the top of Hedgerow (at 92m) where you can park a few vehicles.",
