    "description": "\r\nBowen Island is the closest island to Vancouver and easily accessed for a day paddle.  Ferries leave Horseshoe Bay every hour or so, for the 20 minute ride to Snug Cove.  Walk your kayak onto the ferry, or rent a boat on the Island.  You can launch right at the terminal, but watch out for ferries and their wakes. As usual in populated areas, watch out for power boats, and make sure you're not having lunch in someone's front yard. \r\n\r\nNote that on the windward side of Bowen Island, the seas can pick up, so this turns an average level of difficulty outing into a difficult one.  If you are unsure of yourself, consider just staying on the sheltered side of the Island, and doubling back to where you started at Snug Cove.\r\n\r\nNote there is also a \"round Bowen Island\" sea kayak race here annually in early June.  Have a look for it.\r\n\nMap of Bowen Island: NTS Map 092G06",
