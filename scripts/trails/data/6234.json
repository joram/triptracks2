    "description": "The original highway through the mountains, this now closed road makes an easy and scenic ski.  It is double track-set with a skating lane as well.  Generally flat but has a couple interesting hills to liven it up a bit, nothing too serious for people used to XCing on hills.\nYou start at Lake Louise and end at the Lake O'Hara parking lot where you will likely turn around and ski back.  Along the way you will pass the original Great Divide / Welcome to British Columbia arch and a little picinick shelter.\nThis is often an In-n-Out trail though the more adventurous could use the Ross Lake T at the 8.1km mark (trailhead marked with a sign) to make it a loop of sorts.  Both trails are open to mountain bikes but Ross isn't track set for skis and it might be difficult terrain for your average skinny-ski skier.\nThere was actually a bear sighting along this trail in Dec.'08.  He apparently didn't get the memo about IT WAS TIME TO HIBERNATE",
    "directions": "Drive to Lake Louise (~170km West of Calgary), take the off-ramp, go through town and up towards Lake Louise (the lake & Chalet).  5.4km from the center of the overpass you will see the Divide trailhead on the right.  Park.  Ski.",
