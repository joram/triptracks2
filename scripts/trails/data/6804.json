    "description": "Maintained by the Faculty of Forestry at the University of British Columbia, the UBC Malcolm Knapp Research Forest was established in 1949 from a Crown grant. The forest is located near Maple Ridge and a section of the park contains well marked trails used by hikers and joggers.\r\rThere are a variety of trails to hike in the area and it is best to pick up a map at the office building by the gate to the park. The map shows several trails by color and it corresponds with the maps and trail markings throughout the park.\r\rAll trails are beautiful and feater second growth forest, mossy paths, still marshes, bushy paths, and a variety of local fauna such as dog wood, pine, and cedar along with plenty of birds to watch like finches, chickadees, crows and more.\r\rAll trails eventually loop back to the back of the Faculty base and parking lot via paved path.\r\rTo download a PDF map of the trails go to: www.mkrf.forestry.ubc.ca/pdf/Trails%20Map_2006.pdf",
