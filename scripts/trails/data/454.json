    "description": "Classic Whistler Old School. \r\nThe climbs are short with varying pitches and rock outcroppings for you to hop up onto. These also provide nice technical options on the descending sections of trail. This trail is pretty rocky adding to the technical aspect. A XC dually would be ideal for this trail. \r\n\r\nOff this trail is the classic Big Kahuna which will take you back to the start.",
    "directions": "Ride up to the top of Emerald Estates. Park where you see an access road coming out with a gate across. Go up this trail past the water tower. When you get to an intersection of old skidder roads, keep left (right will take you on Section 102). This double track will turn into single track. The first trail you see on the left is BIG KAHUNA; keep going. The next intersection will be for 'No Girly Man'. Go left for this trail as indicated on this map to get back to Hwy 99 sooner. If you continue to the right on Shit Happens you will parallel Hwy 99 awhile longer and come out in another Subdivision before Alpine Meadows.\r",
