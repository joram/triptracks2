    "description": "A shortish bushwack to two unknown waterfalls in Guysborough County.  I looked on some topo maps and there was an old logging road that led almost to the fall.  Unfortunately, this road has been overgrown with a lot of alders and shrubbery and some sections have a lot of deadfall on top of it.  The forest is a mixture of conifers and deciduous trees but it?s almost all evergreen close to the falls.  This is a two tier fall of about 15ft each with a small section in the middle where the stream changes direction before flowing down.  The moss is so thick it?s a smooth walk around the falls.",
    "directions": "From Antigonish, highway 7 towards Sherbrooke.  Turn left on Melrose/Country Harbour Road.  The fall is upstream of the brook flowing at 45.263742,-61.96907.  The overgrown road is about 300m east of that point.",
