    "description": "\r\nThis hiking trail to Cypress Lake is a good hike year around. It starts off at the top of Westwood Plateau, where Johnson meets Parkway Ave. Travelling up first a short paved road past a city works site you quickly enter second growth hemlock forest. The road quickly changes to an old gravel logging roads. Crossing several streams you continue to follow the main road uphill for a little over an hour and a half, ignoring the smaller side trails, you will reach Cypress Lake. While the lake is not overly attractive this is a nice area to explore, with several nearby trails leading to impressive lookouts. If you like fishing, Cypress Lake holds small rainbow trout which can be tricky to catch.\r\n\r",
    "directions": "\r\n\r\nFollow Johnson road past where it changes into Plateau Blvd. Where Plateau meats Parkway (at a sharp 90 degree turn), park and walk past the yellow gate. A small sign names this as the trail head.\u00a0",
