    "description": "This is a trail with several great features!  There is a canal, a lake, a waterfall and a concrete culvert at the bottom of the dam that has the best echo ever!The top of the falls are reasonably easy to access.  The bottom of the falls is a different story... you'll need a bit more agility to walk through mature forest down fairly steep terain.",
    "directions": "From Middleton, take Hwy 10 south until you get to the trailhead.  There is some parking at the beginning of the access road.",
