    "description": "This is a nice and easy exploratory walk to a series of small falls on the Veinot brook located just south of Bridgewater.   There is not a lot of falls in this area and I visited a few on this day on some other brooks as well (Wiles and Rhodonizer bk).   From the road you already see or hear the first few sets of falls.  In the next few minutes, you can keep the camera on the tripod as you come up to many small but picturesque falls.  On the south side of the brook lies an old concrete structure and a couple of old abandonned cares from the 40 or 50's.   After a while the brook slows down and you enter a really flat area.  You would think the falls are over but if you continue following the brook for may 10 minutes you will be rewarded by a series of falls set in a nice small ravine.",
    "directions": "highway 331 south of Bridgewater and park at the brook approx at N44.36853 W64.50090",
