    "description": "This is a neat little cove and shoreline to explore.  There are multiple waterfalls and some small sea caves to see.  What impressed me the most was the super size icicles that were numerous and look very thick so that you could do some ice climbs in the winter.  The first part where you follow the brook is not too much fun but the remainder of the hike on the seafloor is spectacular.",
    "directions": "Highway 215.  The brook nofollow to the shoreline is at N45 15.803 W63 55.881",
