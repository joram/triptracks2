    "description": "I need some help on this one.  I have seen a picture of a decent size waterfall on Maple Brook but unfortunately I don't know exactly where it is.  On a fine fall day, I took my gps end entered the woods cutting across a logged area to find the brook at  the bottom of a small valley.  Which way to turn....I went upstream first and walked about 1km.  I did find some small drops but nothing like the picture I saw.  I decided that maybe the fall could be downstream as there was a drop in the elevation on the topo.  What I did end up finding is a well made ATV trail and a massive bridge.I never found the large fall.  So if you know where it is and are willing to share, could you post something?",
    "directions": "Highway 347 to Lorne.  turn on dirt road and go to Elgin.  Take elgin Rd to Centredale and turn right on Centredale Rd and then another right on unnamed logging road on your right just past the farm.  The atv trail is at  45\u00b024'34.22\"N, 62\u00b038'58.50\"W",
