    "description": "We met at 9 am in Bellevue and carpooled to Roslyn (I90, Exit 80). Forest Road 116 - the start of the approach - is the first road after passing Newport Creek. We parked our car there and started walking up the forest road at 10:40 am. It was snowing at the time and approx. 30 degrees. After walking on the muddy road for ~1/2 mile, we encountered snow covered with a breakable crust. Donning our snowshoes we continued for another mile to the start of the hiking trail marked with a prominent sign. We then ascended the ridge in NNE direction to 4800 ft. We successfully summitted Hex Mountain (5034 ft) at 12:35pm. \r\rAfter taking a few pictures at the summit, we descended to find a wind protected lunch spot and then continued our descent. We returned successfully to our car at 3:30pm and re-hydrated at the Starbucks in North Bend with the largest tea they had. We got back to Bellevue at 5:15pm.\r\r",
