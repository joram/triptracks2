    "description": "A relatively unknown beach is hidden near Lawrencetown; Conrads Beach.  The parking area is small at the trailhead and there is almost no one on the beach itself.  From the parking lot, you traverse two small bridges, which drain a fairly large salt marsh.  Once you have crossed the bridges you traverse a wide beach grass area.  There is a small spur trail going east off at the middle of the wooden boardwalk.  Once at the beach you can either go to the right and have a look at the end of the beach where a stream enters the ocean.  Be careful as this area in notorious for rip currents because of the inflow of freshwater. There are also a few geocaches to find in the immediate area of the beach.March 2016. A new boardwalk leading to the beach is nearly completed. It makes access easier.",
