    "description": "A challenging out and back trail that offers tremendous views that only get better with elevation. The trail is well defined, no worries about getting off trail.The trail head has a paved parking lot with room for over a dozen cars.The trail starts off with an gentle climb for the first 1.5 km, and then it's a steady uphill for about 5 Km with several small boulder scrambles. The last 1 km is an easier uphill section that rewards with an incredible cliff edge viewpoint at the end.",
    "directions": "In Tucson take E Skyline Drive to N Alvernon Way, then park at Finger Rock Parking. Follow the road uphill about 200 m to the Finger Rock Trail head. Stay on this trail until about 850 m from the summit where you encounter a trail junction. At this point turn left (almost due North) and continue for about 650 m to another trail junction signed as Mt Kimball; turn right and follow this trail to the end (about 200 m) to the lookout.",
