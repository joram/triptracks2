    "description": "The hike is described in the Mackenzie River post as you basically will traverse this brook en route to the falls on the Mackenzie River.   I had spotted some dark spots on sat imagery on this brook and I wasn't disappointed.   The only way to enter the gorge at a few places is to be on the north side of the river as the south side has super high cliffs.  there are at least 5 drops all within sight of each other.  One of them has this really super cool looking cave carved out on the brooks edge.  I couldn't get to it as the water was high and cold but I would love to see a picture of this place (N46.79904\u00b0 W60.83112\u00b0).Falls on the Benjies Lake Brook  are centered around N46.79894\u00b0 W60.83125\u00b0.",
