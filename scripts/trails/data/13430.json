    "description": "Nice leg stretcher of no more than 500m between Sydney and St Peters.  This fall is only about 15 ft but very scenic.  The brook is small so only go after large rainfall or spring melt.",
    "directions": "Highway 4.  Turn on Lynches River Rd.  Continue until you cross a small bridge (look at my gps track).  Park here and follow the brook upstream to the fall.",
