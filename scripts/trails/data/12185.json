    "description": "This is a hike to two falls on the O'Toole Brook near Barr Settlement.   The first fall has a little path right to it and is about a 15ft.  the second one you need to navigate through the woods for maybe 5-10minutes.  You start at the clearing at the end of Maplewood Rd and then aim in a west direction to the fall.  You cross a small ravine to start with and then up into a mature softwood forest.  You then spot the stream and move upstream to the 30ft fall.  This fall location was given to me by fellow explorer (Andrew H.) Tks a bunch!",
    "directions": "Barr settlement Rd and turn on Maplewood Rd and park at the end.  Fall is located at N45.13263 W63.62453 and then the other smaller fall is located at N45.13710 W63.61606",
