    "description": "The entire route follows gorgeous turquoise lakes that are surrounded by 1,200 and 1,700-foot hills.  The portages are demanding as many of them involve steep climbs, however the scenery and wildlife are spectacular and the views from the ridge tops are some of the best vistas in Ontario.  A day hike to Silver Peak (the parks highest point) is a must and it takes approx. 2-3 hours to reach the top.  This is by far one of the most beautiful parks we have in Ontario, and the closest we have to B.C. For a very nice posting on the hiking trail of La Cloche, see this listing on trailpeak entitled La Cloche - Silhouette Route for another great description and lots of hike pictures.  There are many comments under this trail write-up indicating it is one of the top hikes in North America, well certainly east of the rockies.",
    "directions": "The trip starts and ends at George Lake Access Point and the route follows the lake systems that surround the LaCloche Hiking Trail running through the park.  Many variations of this trip can be made, however following the lakes that border the hiking trail allows one to see almost the entire park.",
