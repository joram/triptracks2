    "description": "A great well marked and maintained trail just north of Powell River.  This stretch involves a steep hike up to Confederation Hut on the same-named lake, then a descent down to Fiddlehead Landing Hut, and then a steep slog up to the top of Tin Hat Mountain.",
    "directions": "Drive into PR along Marine Avenue, straight through the first light (by the Marine Inn), turn right at the 2nd light (Marine Ave/Alberni St). Drive up Alberni through one light to intersection with Manson. Turn left. Take a right at Cassiar, just past a little store. Drive around part of Cranberry Lake, and you will see the Inland Lake/Haywire Bay Park sign.",
