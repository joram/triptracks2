    "description": "Location: Westbank, BC\r\nType: XC Route\r\nDistance: approx 15km.\r\nTime: 2 hours\r\n\r\nDescription: Mellow singletrack climb. Easily done in granny gear with a few short sections of technical climbing. Hammerheads could mid ring it. \r\n\r\nThe ground is very open and dry.  Not recommended for mid-summer (too hot).\r\n\r\nDecent views.\r\n\r\nFast and flowy descent with small jumps and a couple of easy log rides.\r\n\r\nTechnical play area at bottom for warmup.\r\n\r\nLocal shop (Outbound Cycle) has map for sale which is keyed to numbered markers at all junctions. Well marked and easy to navigate.",
    "directions": "Go north from downtown Westbank on Eliott Road.  Follow it as it winds uphill, then turn right on Smith Creek Road.  You park in a gravel pit just BEFORE the powerline crossing.  Ride up the road past the Lutheran camp and take the singletrack on the left side of the road.\r\n\r\nDefinitely pick up the local map with the key to the markers, as the network in here is well braided.  There are trails everywhere.\r\n\r",
