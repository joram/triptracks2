    "description": "A 3000' DH run near Kamloops.  This one isn't all DH though, as there's a short climb near the top and a bit of pedaling about 3/4's of the way down.  A lot of this trail is doubletrack and powerline access.   Really high speeds are possible.  There's a bit of techical singletrack, and some decent pitches near the end.\r\n\r\nCourse record is about 18 minutes, post your time in the review/comments section below!",
    "directions": "Take Hwy 1 west from Kamloops.  About five miles down the two lane section, watch for Greenstone Mtn Rd.  The trail starts from the top of this road, about 22 km up.  The trail exits on the bench about 3 km up.  \r\n\r\nThere's a junction at this point as you're driving up.  Turn left there to get to the top of the mountain, turn right to check out hte camp area at the base of the trail.",
