    "description": "A comprehensive online map can be found: hereThis map shows all existing Trail Heads and Trails, each shown in different colors. These correspond with the colored markers that can be found on the trails. Brief descriptions of each trail are also provided under the map.ARROWLEAF TRAIL - Moderate Hike (Time=53min, Length=2.5km, Elevation change=100m)This main trail connects the Upper Lakes Trail Head to the Grand Overlook. Stop along the way (through an ocean of Okanagan sunflowers, in full bloom that first week of May) to take in the beautiful views of Wood Lake and the Oyama benchlands. As you start to climb you will cross pioneer horse logging trails and the vistas continually expand with more lakes coming into view.Directions to UPPER LAKES TRAIL HEADFrom Highway 97, take Oceola Road to \"The Lakes\" subdivision turning right onto Lake Hill Drive, turn left onto Shoreline Drive and then left onto Apex Drive. At the end of Apex Drive continue up gravel road to the left to the parking area below the water tank. Trail Head is marked with a WALC (Walk Around Lake Country) sign. Arrowleaf Trail is identified with yellow trail markers.",
