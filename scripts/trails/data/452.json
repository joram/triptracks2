    "description": "Don't let the first kilometre of this trail put you off. It starts off with a climb of 250 meters in elevation in the first kilometre. It flattens out just before you get to the lake, allowing you to catch your breath. The lake is beautiful and clear, surrounded by towering peaks, and full of fish.  You can easily fish from shore at any number of spots along the trail.We camped here in April last year. The snow was almost gone at this elevation so it made a good early overnighter. There aren't any facilities but there are plenty of places to pitch a tent.The trail continues along Lindeman Lake (often scrambling over scree) to the end of the lake where there's a boardwalk. The nice big sandy beach here is an inviting place for a swim.The trail was not very well marked for a little while at this point due to a rock slide when I was here but it's probably better marked now. Cross some more scree and then you're back into the woods on the trail up to Greendrop. The trail was mostly snow covered in April but was still pretty easy to follow. You follow Post Creek, climbing to 910 meters over the next kilometre with plenty of boulders to scramble over. There is a branch trail at 5 km. Following the right takes you to a picnic area and campsite at the south end of the lake. The left one takes you up above the lake into the Skagit Valley. It was a winter wonderland when I was there so I can't comment on the camping/picnic areas.",
    "directions": "From Vancouver, take Hwy 1 to Chilliwack. Take Vedder road to Chilliwack Lake Road. (I don't think there's a signpost when you're coming from this direction... it's just before you go over the bridge at the Chilliwack River). The trailhead is 39 km along the Chilliwack Lake Road.",
