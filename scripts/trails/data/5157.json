    "description": "Victoria Park is a place I practically grew up in. My elementary school was right on the boarder, and many a class trip, field day and lunch time excursion were to be had along the steep banks, paths, waterfalls and babbling brook.With my visit to Irwin Lake Chalets,  I took a trip down memory lane, and revisited the park. There are over 20 Kms of trails there, intermingled with steep stair climbs like Jacob's ladder, and ancient rock outcroppings. Boardwalk infrastructure protects the banks from erosion, offering you great panoramic views of the gorge. Like all good walks, there's plenty of eye candy along the way, and several of the paths allow you to see and hear Waddell and Joe Howe falls cascade water along Lepper Brook, having no doubt chizzled out what is now the steep banks of Lepper Gorge.The park was created in 1887 with land donated by a Waddell local, and has since been expended to 1000 acres, preserving beautiful mixed forest, nature trails and waterfalls. Stately Norweigen Pines are easily identified with their upward sweeping bows, made even more stunning with snow cover.It's a park that provides year round activities such as snowshoeing and xc skiing, running, hiking, mtn biking, swimming, and even some bouldering and ice climbing, though probably not officially sanctioned by the trusties!With a packed lunch, you could easily fill a day enjoying Victoria Park.shannon Burt",
