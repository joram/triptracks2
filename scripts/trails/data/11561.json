    "description": "I had seen this name on a topo map and it got me interested; zinc spout....I was wondering what kind of feature that might be.   Google earth wasshpwing some promising rocks and water features and close by was another feature which appealed to me; Dog Falls.Well the dog falls are only about 5ft high but still a nice spot to visit and so easy as it is close to the road.  Once you finish looking at  the fall you can either follow the stream down or get back on the Cherryfield Rd for another 300m or so.  Here you will find a fairly well maintained ATV path going downhill towards the Lahave river.At the river you will see a narroiwng of the flow due to constriction from some pretty impressive rock walls on either side...well I guess that's why the named it a spout!",
