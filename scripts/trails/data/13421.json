    "description": "One easy place to see falls but you may have to get your feet wet to about mid chin bone.   The walk is quite easy and follows the river from the highway.  A well worn path exists all the way except where you will need to cross the river.  River crossings are necessary since some really high bluffs appear from time to time along the river.\n\nThe fall is a multi tier with cascades and lots of swimming holes.  It is well know so dont be surprised if you are not the only one there",
    "directions": "Highway to Eskasoni from Sydney.  MacIntosh Brook flows under highway at; 101. MacIntosh Brook Fall (Islandview) Trailhead.  there is a large parking area by the bridge.",
