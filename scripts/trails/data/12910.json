    "description": "A nice little front rage summit with great views, in the Sheep River area.Park at Indian Oils Day Use Area and hike 1.8 km up Sheep Trail. There on the right, just before the road dips to cross a creek, there's an old road. Follow this road as it winds its way up the mountain before ending 100 m below the broad north ridge of Hoffman. After leaving the end of the road, bushwhack to the crest. Then follow the ridge, keeping west so as to hit the open slopes below the summit.",
