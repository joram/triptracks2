    "description": "In the Havre du Maison region, a local \r\nattraction is Butte Ronde, a steep hill with a \r\ncross raised on its high point. The cross was \r\nerected in 1913 and a rather difficult though \r\nshort 1.5K trail takes you both straight up, \r\nand then around its back side, and back to \r\nthe parking area. A rope hand rail has been \r\nput in place to assist this very steep climb, as \r\nthe path makes a B-line for the top. No one \r\nthought of switch backs. \r\n\r\nWhat a spot for a siesta! The cool off shore \r\nbreezes combining with mid summer \r\nafternoon sun, make lying on the grass as \r\nattractive as the views of both the rugged \r\ncoast line, the hillocks and pasture land.\r\n\r\nThe return down the back is equally a fun \r\nride. Steep sections combine with gentle \r\ncurves through grasslands and a short stand \r\nof stunted forest growth. This is a fun, \r\nthough technical little trail. \r\n\r",
