    "description": "With a name like Devil's Jaw, I knew I had to go and explore that area!   I started off on a dirt road which leads to a firing range.  then I veered off into the woods to bushwack my way to this feature.  It soon became apparent that the understory here is quite dense.   I was literally swimming in evergreens!  That and the deep snow between the shrubs made this trip a curse filled morning!After a while you come to the top of s small slope and then you descend all the way to the edge of the Herbert river.  Walked upstream and was blown away byt the ridiculously named Devil's Jaw.  These are three small overfalls with the biggest being maybe 3ft in height.   I talked to a paddler and he said he easily runs them when there is enough water.I walked back to my car using a small stream that lead back towards the firing range thiking that the large boggy areas would be easier to traverse than the evergreen patches.  But even at -16C, I was sinking down to my knees in the boggy area.",
