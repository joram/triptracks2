    "description": "This trail is part of the Carmi cross country ski trails area. It can be hiked and mountain biked as well.  For the average skier or mountain bike rider it is a nice trail to get into shape on.  A gradual climb to the top and lots of roller coaster style portions on the downhill.  This trail also intersects the \"Code 4\" mountiain bike trail for extreme riders which contain tons of ladders, drops and jumps.Bike shop / rentals: Freedom Bike Shop Accomodations: Summerland Resort",
