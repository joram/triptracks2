    "description": "This hike starts at the cell towers in White's Lake and ends at Nice View Drive, passing by splendid views over Rogue's Roost. Wilderness Area designation is planned for this area.",
    "directions": "From Halifax, take St. Margaret's Bay Road and turn off on the 333 towards Peggy's Cove. Take the Terence Bay exit and park on Tara Drive to walk up the path to the cell tower. You can either walk back up Terence Bay Road at the end or with friends park a second car at Nice View Drive. Nice View Drive is a private road, so consider parking at the end rather than driving up to the top.",
