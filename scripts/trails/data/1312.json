    "description": "Have a quick look at the map at the trailhead; this will save you from making one or two possible wrong turns during the first part of the hike. The trail is wide for the first 3 plus km, and you can cycle this if you wish, passing marshy Burstall Lakes on the way.At about 4 km you cross Burstall Creek on a small footbridge, entering the wide gravel flats immediately (see photos). You may need to don sandals or runners as you cross the many braids of this glacier-fed stream. The trail re-enters forest after .5 km, climbing to open meadows at 5.5 km. About 1 km later you begin the final climb to the Pass.Great views once on top, with lots of opportunities for further hiking or scrambling. I would grade this trail as difficult only if Burstall Creek is high (eg. late afternoon, early summer). Otherwise it is a good trail of average to moderate difficulty.NTS Map: 082J14Elevation Gain: 451 m (1,480 ft).",
    "directions": "From Banff, drive east to Canmore, then south on Spray Lakes Road for 45 km. There is a large parking area beside Mud Lake on your right.If coming from the south, it is about 20 km north of the junction of Smith Dorrien/Spray Lakes Rd and Kananaskis Lakes Trail (ie Road).Spray Lakes Rd. is a gravel road. There are other, mostly paved, options to access this area from Canmore or Calgary.",
