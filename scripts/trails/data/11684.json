    "description": "The ridge hike provides great views of the Highwood River Valley, and the Great Divide, Highwood and Livingston Ranges. The route up to and back from the ridge requires some bush whacking because there is no defined trail.",
    "directions": "The trailhead is on the east side of the Forestry Trunk Road (940) just past the Etherington Creek road bridge; 6 km south of the highway 40 and 940 junction.",
