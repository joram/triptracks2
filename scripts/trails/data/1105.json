    "description": "A loop trail with several entry points at lower elevations. The main climb is up a sandy fire road that changes to a grassy old logging road. The top 500ft to the summit is on sketchy single track marked with occasional rock cairns across thinly forested rock with a few steep climbs. At the summit there is a spectacular view of the Okanagan Valley (Skaha Lake and Penticton). The downhill is nearly continuous drops, turns and fairly steep open rock with lots of breaking along single track where no trail was before.Bike shop / rentals: Freedom Bike Shop Accomodations: Summerland Resort",
    "directions": "This ride is Located on the East side of Skaha Lake south of Penticton. Start by riding up Smythe Road (north entrance) or from the south on single track at the end of Sunnybrook Drive in Lakeshore Highlands/Heritage Hills. Starting from the south the single-double track runs to the north several hundred feet above the lake and eventually joins up with Smythe road when it is a fire road.",
