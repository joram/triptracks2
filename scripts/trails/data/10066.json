    "description": "With a total elevation of 3144m, Mt. Bogart is the second highest peak in the Kananaskis range, after Galatea. There are a number of published routes (eg., Kain) for the east side, but all of these involve an 11km slog through the woods on the approach. The west approach via the tarns eliminates this factor, but presents more objective danger and requires a higher skill level and better route-finding abilities. This approach does not require any significant technical skills. This approach will take you from Spray lakes, through a wooded area, and up a cirque; therefore, you will have to travel a kilometer or two across a moraine and navigate through the tarns on the way up.From the trail head, navigate through the wooded area until you encounter a fork in the path. Take the right path. The left will lead you up Sparrowhead. Continue along this path and emerge from the woods and you will find yourself at the foot of the moraine, which has a lot of really big boulders (one of them is a quarter of the volume of my bedroom). Once you pass this, you'll find yourself overlooking the tarns. Ahead, at the very back of the cirque, you will see a series of ridges leading upwards to the left. This is your objective, and will take you up Bogart.There are a lot of large and loose rocks on this route, and the cliffs are very unstable. I would not recommend relying on them for grip, as large bits break off easily. This is some of the worst scree I've traveled on, and presents significant rockslide potential, so be careful and mind where you are treading. I would recommend taking a mountaineering axe as a third leg. You might also need it at the top, if there is any snow. I did the climb in a particularly dry november, so it wasn't too bad, but regretted not having my axe. Once you are at the ridge, just follow it to the summit block. The summit block may require some technical climbing, but its no more than a couple meters high.",
    "directions": "Take smith dorrien/spray lakes trail to spray lake from Canmore, and watch for signs indicating Sparrowhead. There is a lot on the right hand side with some outhouses, and on the left, there is a trail going into the forest from the highway. It's easy to miss, so keep your eyes peeled. I would recommend purchasing a Gemtrek map in town for $9 or so. The drive is about 45 minutes on gravel.",
