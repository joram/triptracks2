    "description": "Westernmost trail loop in Frontenac provincial park. An easy to moderate trail that passes through a mature hardwood forest and alongside many marshes and an acid bog. The trail leads to campsite 7 on the shore of Birch Lake.This trail offers some great views of the  wetlands and an acid bog and features many wooden installations like bridges and boardwalk over springs and streams. Many beaver dams are visible from the trail and some are just feet away from the bridges. The eastern portion of the loop is the hardest and longest with more elevation than the western section.",
    "directions": "Trail head is reachable from the Corridor Trail that that starts at the park office or from Arab Lake parking lot. It is also possible to get to either the west or east trail from the main road that leads to Big Salmon Lake",
