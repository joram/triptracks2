    "description": "Technogrind is a short, multi-use trail that starts and ends right in the town of Rossland. There aren't any summits (except KC optional) or jaw-dropping views, but the trail is varied and the terrain interesting... bikers are courteous and dogs are most welcome. Besides, who doesn't love a good loop? Walkers can go either direction, bikers may want to go as described (people DO ski the trail, but there are narrow spots and switchbacks through trees, so you must be confident on the sticks).\r\rThe Centennial parking lot is a busy one because there are SO many trails that originate here. A short trail brings you to Monte Cristo (dirt) road, on your right you'll see a gate, go in this direction and you will see that the road switches hard to the left and uphill - follow it. About 5 mins from here there will be a junction with Kootenay-Columbia (KC) trail, and this is where you will come out at the end of the loop. Continue up Monte Cristo for another 20 minutes (pass yellow submarine spur) and watch for a wide trail on your left - it is not signed here, but 30m in you will see a post that reads \"Technogrind\".\r\rThe trail will descend through open cedar forest for about 10mins before levelling out in a narrow meadow. There will be an unmarked route to the left, but avoid unsigned paths (many lead nowhere) and follow the trail to the right. In a few minutes you will reach the Full Monte spur, continue past that for perhaps 100m and the trail will swing hard to the right again. In another 10 minutes you will reach a fork - both ways will emerge in the same place at the top of the hill, the blue option on the right is a gentler slope and wider trail, the left one is steep and technical, with rock faces and hucks.\r\rEither way, you'll emerge on a bit of a knoll, which offers the best views along the trail. You then descend gently through rather open highlands until reaching a 3-way junction. Here you can shoot up to KC summit (maybe 10 minutes) for some great views, or continue to the right toward the parking area. In 50m or less the trail will swing hard to the right and you'll be on a wide, fairly flat track through the woods. About 200m along you'll reach a 4-way jct - stay straight (sign for Rossland). In 15 minutes you'll be back on Monte Cristo rd, having past a random green water tower, and will be just moments from your vehicle.\r\r",
    "directions": "Centennial Trail Head is located at the corner of Washington and highway 3b. If coming through town along main street, turn N (uphill) at the hardware store and follow Washington to the hwy junction. If coming from Red Ski hill area, keep your eyes peeled for a left turn after passing the end of the reservoir on your right.\r\r",
