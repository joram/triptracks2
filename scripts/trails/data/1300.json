    "description": "Crowsnest Mountain stands as a solitary symbol of the entire Crowsnest Pass area in southwestern Alberta. It is a hike/scramble that no self-respecting hiker can ignore. Standing alone with only the Seven Sisters as a wing, it's another of those \"I gotta climb that one\" types.The trail starts at the parking area just off the Alison Creek road. Turn south along a cut line for about 100m and turn left, uphill, along a signed trail. This trail is fairly steep, then gets steeper. At the tree line, the inevitable scree begins. Follow any of the trails straight up to the first headwall, where you will pick your way up to the left (you can also go right but it is longer). Your objective is the next headwall. After gaining the headwall, through more scree, traverse right to an obvious gully in the wall and continue up even more scree. (See a pattern emerging here?). At the top of this gully lies the crux of the climb. A chain is fixed to the rock at this point to aid in ascent but is mostly for descent. Above the chain is a narrow chute about 4-5m high which is easily ascended (more difficult descending).  The rest of the way is a moderate scree ascent to the top. Here you are rewarded with spectacular views of the entire Crowsnest Pass and mountains into BC.Unfortunately, this time we got turned back by ice, so summit photos will have to wait till next year.UPDATE 2007 - finally made it to the summit, perfect day, 10 years since my first attempt.Photos by Brian Coffey, Shelley Coffey and Trevor HelwigNote: This is a scramble. Be aware that scrambling can injure or kill you. Be prepared, know your limits and make sure somebody knows where you're going.NTS Map: 082G10Elevation Gain: 1100 m (3,609 ft).",
