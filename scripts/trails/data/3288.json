    "description": "Possibly one of the most spectacular hikes in the Rockies, with close-up views of numerous glaciers, one of the highest waterfalls in Canada (Takakkaw Falls), peaks of mountains, and much more.Probably called Iceline because is follows the lower edge of several (unfortunately fast-receding) glaciers in Yoho NP, you will get great views of Takakkaw Falls, the Daly Glacier above it that feeds it and the Yoho River, and great views of numerous other glaciers.A must-do trail, which can only be done in summer and early fall as the access road gets closed when the snows come.The GPS data for this trail is for a day hike, along the main trail starting near Takakkaw Falls, and goes 6.6 k in each direction to the Iceline Summit. Overnighters can continue to either Little Yoho Campground (10.4 k) or the Stanley Mitchell hut (of Alpine Club of Canada - contact them for details and reservations) (10.7 k).To Iceline Summit, keep right at all junctions, except the junction to Celeste Lake, where you continue straight ahead (it's at 5.7 k, just before the summit).",
    "directions": "From Banff or Lake Louise, drive west on Highway 1 (Trans Canada Highway) into BC to the turn north to Takakkaw Falls in Yoho National Park.
