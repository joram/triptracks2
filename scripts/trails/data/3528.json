    "description": "Very well traveled until you head south between the ridges. As you start down the trail it swings South West. On a clear day you can see Tent Ridge on your left and a valley just past the ridge. Here lies Shark Lake and your destination.   Confirm with the GPS  track on the site very easy to find once you see the valley. Beautiful views and a nice excursion.",
    "directions": "Very well marked trail starting just up the road from Engadine Lodge off Smith-Dorrien  Road.   1.8K from Smith -Dorrien on the Engadine lodge road the trail starts on the south side of the road and heads West",
