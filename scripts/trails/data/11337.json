    "description": "This is a short hike to the side of Palmer Brook.  That part of the hike is fairly ordinary and if you don't look closely you might miss the entrance to deadman's cave.  Not sure where the name ones from.....The entrance is on the side of the brook as part of the brook is partly diverted into the cave and actively carving it.  I didn't enter this place back when I visited in 2011 as I was in the area in late winter and the water was too cold and high to get in.  The water flows back out into the brook a short distance downstream but the exit was closed off when I was there.  I was at this special spot a long time ago and was emended of it when I was telling a buddy who moved to Sussex bout the many outdoor opportunities nearby.",
    "directions": "Exit 141 on highway 1 near Quispamsis.  Turn on highway 119 south and then on Parkside Rd and then to the end of Redwood lane.  Get into the woods and find Palmer brook.",
