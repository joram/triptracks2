    "description": "NTS Map:92F12.  Several beautiful cascading waterfalls.  Can walkclimb up and down the falls.  Could go for a swim in some of the calmer pools.  We spotted a black bear here trying to negotiate the falls.  The trail to falls is a steep trail but nothing too bad.  Would imagine the falls to be spectacular in the spring once the snow starts to melt.",
    "directions": "Take the Island highway north to Campbell River, hang a left onto highway 28.  Then take Westmin Road south to Lower Myra Falls parking lot.  The last 100 meters is a somewhat rough road but no problem, we did it in a sunfire. About 1.5 hours from Courtenay.",
