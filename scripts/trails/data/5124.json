    "description": "A fairly narrow, technical, windy, rocky trail that is easy to get to and a lot of fun when you're on it.  Several hard climbs and several really fun, swoopy downhills.  There are several sets of stairs to climb up but they're all rideable on the way down.  And there is a couple stunts on the trail including a wooden bridge about 1/2m wide and 2m in the air.  (I don't heal fast enough to want to try that one).\nWe did it as a 7km each way (Hey!  It was +32C)  in and out, I'm not sure where the western end of the trail gets to.  \nStart at Heart Creek parking area, there looks like a great trail with no sign of a bridge across a major chasm.  So, go West down the road you drove in on and look for the 2-track trail up under the power lines.  Follow those up for about 100m and look for a hard left up to the trail.  Now you're on it.  Start ridin' west.",
    "directions": "Go west from Calgary on the TC Hiway #1 for about 75km (starting at Calgary Olympic Park lights) to the Lac Des Arcs overpass.  Exit to the overpass and go North.  Follow the gravel road up into the Heart Creek Recreation Area.",
