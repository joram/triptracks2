    "description": "Best to do these trails in dry conditions.  Good cross country trail with no hard descents.  Beautiful scenery.  There are a few spots that tend to be muddy, so don't chew up the trails if you can avoid it.\nWell built, singletrack trails brought to you by the *very* hard working Greater Bragg Creek Trails Association (GBCTA) who are a purely volunteer group (and who would be happy to have your help on a trail build day).\nIf you're biking, it is rideable in either direction and has pretty good flow.\nIt also ties into a number of other open and under-construction trails such as Ranger Summit, Strange Brew, Sugar Momma, Fullerton Loop, and in the future, BobCat, Snakes and Ladders.  It can also use these and the newer Snagmore Hill and Boundry Ridge trails to make a longer circuit.\nCAUTION!  It is open to hikers, bikers, horse-ers and snowshoers, so make sure you ride in control and don't spook the other users.",
