    "description": "The best view of the Yoho Glacier itself is actually from the trailhead! The view from the end of the 8.7 km official trail is only of the rocky moraine left by the receding glacier. We continued for another 1.5 km along a cairned route, but one would have to climb a lot higher to get a better view of the glacier.",
    "directions": "Start at the Takakkaw Falls parking lot at the end of the Yoho Valley Road.",
