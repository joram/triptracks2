    "description": "Natural High is one of the first trails you can ride on Fromme. The trailhead is before the first switchback, right across from the water towers. This is a short trail with lots of ladders and stunts, even a couple gappers. Most of the ladders provide exit options, drop, ride off or bigger drop. It exits on lower Fromme near a ladder/log ride park. Fromme can get really muddy so only try this one when it hasn't rained in a few days. This is a great short climb, and quick fun trail for after-work biking.\nMore Mt Fromme mountain biking trails can be found here.",
    "directions": "Across from the water tower before the first switchback on Fromme. To get to Fromme (otherwise known as Grouse), take 'Mountain Highway' (not a highway) in North Vancouver up the mountain, park where you can without violating residential parking restrictions, and ride past the yellow gate.",
