    "description": "Curly Sands was not clear at first but if you park at North Fork camp grounds cross the road and head over to the field where you start to see the forest. There is a trail sign there. Overall curly sands is a really nice hike, the 9999 portion is a easy hike but lots of tall weeds. There are two creek crossings.",
    "directions": "North Fork cross the road to the left you will see a trail marking on a tree.",
