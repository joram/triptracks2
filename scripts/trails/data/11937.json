    "description": "This is a rare treat for me in HRM...new to me trails!  I was out in the Beaverbank area for work when I stumbled upon these trails.  These are a true hidden gem.  They are all on private land but the owner encourages hikers to use them.  There are multiple tracks and are in the forest, out in the open or following some brooks.  The trail itself is in a magnificent shape as you can see a lot of work as gone into maintaining them.",
    "directions": "Off highway 354 at  44.861846, -63.687257 there is a dirt road leading to a scout camp.  Park at the gate and walk on the road past the second bridge.  The trail start on the left after the bridge.",
