  "description": "From albertawow.com...\r\rSulphur Skyline is located near Miette Hot Springs in Jasper National Park approximately 63Km East of the Jasper Town site. Sulphur Skyline is one of the best half day hikes found in the Jasper area. This hike offers excellent views and is considered moderate with a total elevation gain of 723m. Return trip distance of approximately 9.5km, allow 3-4 hours return. The Sulphur Skyline trail head is located near Miette Hot Springs so expect to see lots of people here during the summer months. The trailhead is located behind to the right of the Miette Hot Springs Pool. Here you'll find the trails sign marker and a paved path leading East. The paved path ends after a 100 meters or so then turns into a proper hiking trail. Crowds of people that are mostly visiting the Miette Hot Springs will be on this section of the trail. Keep going approximately 2.5Km until you reach a T intersection. At this intersection the trail continues straight ahead towards Mystery Lake so you'll need to turn right onto the Sulphur Skyline trail. From this point the trail gets much steeper. As you gain altitude views towards the West start to come into sight. During late June and the month of July several varieties of wildflowers can be found along the entire trail. Keep working your way up past a small meadow then hike the final short rocky section to the summit ridge. If the weather is bad at the meadow expect the summit weather to be extreme. When you arrive at the meadow you'll see a large boulder that makes for a good wind break. This rock is a nice spot to eat your lunch or layer up for the summit. Views from the summit of Sulphur Ridge are absolutely stunning. Way below you towards the West you can see Miette Hot Springs. Views at the East end of the ridge are almost straight down towards the Fiddle River. Trail heads to Opal Hills, Bald Hills, Mount Edith Cavell, Whistlers Mountain, Maligne Canyon, Horse Shoe Lake and Athabasca Falls are also located in the Jasper area. You are in Bear country.",
  "directions": "East of Jasper on Hwy 16 for 44km, then turn right on the Fiddle Road. Take the Fiddle Road for 17km to the Miette Hot Springs. Go straight through the parking lot and park by the picnic area.",
