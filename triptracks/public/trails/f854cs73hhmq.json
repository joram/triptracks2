  "description": "This makes a good stop if you're in the area checking out other waterfalls like the nuttby falls or further up the 311 to Drysadale and the others. Its quick and easy to find and nice place for pictures.",
  "directions": "Drive on the 311 and head until just past upper North River and the beginning of Nuttby Mountain park on the little dirt road 45.50679, -63.21136. Proceed to walk 50 ft down the dirt path until you notice a small trial on the right. You'll have to look close and you'll see flagging tape and makeshift walkway and fencing. The falls is 2 or 3 min hike.",
