  "description": "The hike takes you, right at the beginning, through some steep terrain with a bit off scrambling. However, the trail is very well travelled and marked with some astonishing views from a few lookouts along the way to the top looking onto East Sooke Park, Sooke mountains, the bay and town of Sooke. Unfortunately, we never reached the peak of Mt. Bluff which we thought we had but as indicate by the GPS we actually needed to travel another 3 more kms and approx. another hour to reach. The trail was well marked and travelled to the first peak we reached, but soon after, we found that the trail began to fade out with a few minor misleading paths which we had to backtrack from to get back to the main trail which was getting more overgrown but still ended up being well flagged. You just needed to pay attention. The trailhead is right ahead as you walk down the road towards the hill. It's well marked.",
  "directions": "Take TransCanada Hwy to Colwood exit and follow until it turns into Sooke Road. Follow  Sooke Road all the way into town until you come to Otter Point Road where you turn right. You follow that road all the way to Young Lake Road where you turn right again and follow that through the 4-way stop signs until you have reached the Scout's campgrounds. You are allowed to park at the Scout's Camp parking lot during the week but the weekends are usually off limits. So it is best to call before deciding to head out and go for a hike up to Mt Bluff.",
