  "description": "A very nice hike that takes you through some wonderful forest. The blue route is very well marked with flagging and painted spots on trees and rocks, while the yellow route is not as visible but marked well enough. Also you can tell which trail is travelled more. The coastal (yellow) is more strenuous then the blue route. But both have scenic views.Blue then yellow is recommended. The southern turn around point using the descending pink trail comes soon after a long descent along a rocky bluff dotted with arbutus and Gary oaks.",
  "directions": "From Victoria you take TransCanada Hwy passed Duncan. You turn right on  Herd Road, follow that until you come to Osborne Bay Road where you turn left and you follow that for about 7 minutes and Chilco Road will be on you right. You follow that to the end where you will come to a Col De Sac. You can park along the road without obstructing driveways. There will be a yellow gate which is the trailhead into the park.",
