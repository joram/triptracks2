  "description": "A fairly flat trail taking a loop around Flying Shot lake on the south side of Elk Island National Park. Opportunities to view Wood Bison, the largest of the two species in the park, with the smaller Plains Bison herd located on the north side. Also free-roaming, are Moose, Elk, and Whitetail Deer. Migratory and other birds are also plentiful around the lake. As a wildlife photographer (click for site), I generally extend my trek 8 to 10 hours where I can take my time in finding and photographing wildlife, thus, allowing for a full day of activities. A word of caution about these 2000 lb.+ Wood Bison, a minimum 300 mm. lens is a necessity in order as not to get to close to these monsters. In general they are peaceful, as long as not provoked. Water and snacks, as well as insect repellant will make your day very delightful. A valid park pass is available from several gates on the north side.    (see photos which were all taken around flying shot lake)",
  "directions": "From Edmonton, take the Yellow Head #16 east. The drive is about 45 minutes to Elk Island National Park, exit the south side, then slightly west to the parking lot and the trail head.",
