  "description": "A long time ago, I explored the Debert River and posted a trailpeak post about it.  Long storu short is that I hiked along ways to see some small falls...nothing high like most of the rivers flowing on the south side of the cobequid hills.   Fast forward a few years and I am still haunted by the river and potential fall that I may have missed.  The old map mention a fall of about 35 ft in an area just downstream of a logging road bridge.  so its an easy hike...no bushwack involved.  I was in the area exploring the Folly river and decided to drop in to the Debert river to see that potential fall.I parked around N45\u00b0 32' 01.1\" W63\u00b0 26' 29.2\"\", and headed for the bridge.  I followed the river downstream.  A small 5ft fall is just downstream of the bridge.  Soon after you enter a mini gorge like setting.  the river here has carved its path through sheer rock walls.  On the downstream end, I could see remnants of rock walls.  the tallest fall in this area is a only a few feet so disappointing in that aspect but the gorge makes it up for scenery.  So the conclusion here is the old map were describing a fall that was probably only present when a dam was constructed along this part of the river...my new topo map actually have a small dam icon at this location!  BTW the best fall to see on Debert is at; N45\u00b0 30' 52.8\" W63\u00b0 26' 22.5\" or on a tributary (at time of high water only)  at N45\u00b0 29' 46.3\" W63\u00b0 26' 56.8\".",
  "directions": "In Belmont. Take Belmont Rd heading north.  continue straight on Upper Belmont Rd and turn right at Y intersection at; N45\u00b0 30' 13.2\" W63\u00b0 23' 12.2\".  continue heading west until you drive down a hill and see a bridge on your left; N45\u00b0 32' 01.1\" W63\u00b0 26' 29.2\"",
