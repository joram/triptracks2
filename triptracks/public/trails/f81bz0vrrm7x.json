  "description": "I have been exploring for remote and unknown fall for over ten years in Nova Scotia.  However I am still amazed by this province as I can still get some leads on waterfalls which are actually not very remote and still unknown to me!I saw a post on a fb waterfall group describing this fall.  The person gave the name of the brook and the name of the road and said its a few min from the road.  Since there is only one branch of the brook that crosses this road, I decided to explore it.As soon as you park on the side of the road, an Atv trail leads to the brook and the fall.  It right there!  In the summer it might be a bit more hidden but in the spring you can see the top of the fall as it dissapears.  On the way is an old abandoned vintage car and there are a few more of those up on the hill to the left of the brook if facing upstream.  the fall is gorgeous and about 20-25ft.",
  "directions": "Highway 360 N towards Harbourville.   Turn right on highway 221.  Turn left on Back Rock Rd and climb up North Mountain.  turn left on West Black Rock Rd.  Drive about 2.3km to the brook.  there are guardrails in place and its approximately at 45.136936, -64.723985",
