  "description": "This is a great short snowshoe or hiking trip year-round. Elevation gain is mild, about 800 feet.  The time is rated 3 hours round-trip for snowshoe, which is a conservative time. It would take less time without the snow or if you travel quicker.\nThere is GPS data attached to this trail (see \"download GPS\"), which if loaded into your GPS can help you find route points.",
  "directions": "From Seattle:I-90 EastExit 45 (FR 9030)Left at exitFollow up the road to junction, stay right.\nIf there's snow, you might like to park 1/4 mile before the end of the road (2.84 mi from the exit.) The trail starts at the end of the road. You may be able to drive to the end of the road depending on snow and your vehicle.",
