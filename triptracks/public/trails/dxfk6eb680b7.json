  "description": "I found this trail system the other day while checking out a geo-cache further down the road.\nThe \"trail head\" if you can call it that is at N44 21.736, W064 14.009 it is a parking spot on the side of the road. It is a mix of trail and deer runs. The trails in the area seem endless. \nThe trails run around on some barren rocks with shrubs. There are great views everywhere. A great spot to explore for an hour or so. \nYou may want a GPS if you have a very poor sense of direction as the trails are very hard to follow but the area is very open, and you are never too far from the road. I ended up having to cut through a half frozen marsh to complete my return to the car.\nthought others may enjoy the spot\ncheers",
  "directions": "Head to Blue Rocks out past Lunenburg on blue rocks road, then take Stonehurst road, then south side rd. park at the following location and head into the woods.\nN44 21.736, W064 14.009",
