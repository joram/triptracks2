  "description": "The PR/Oasis combo starts at the top of a gravel forest road.  You rip down the road (at high speed of course) for a couple of km's before entering into PR at the first switch back.  PR is a fairly short trail full of 3' to 7' hucks.  It enters onto the same forest road.  Oasis enters the trees at the 6 km mark.  Oasis is a 6 km long high-speed double track trail.  Keep your head up for surprise corners and wildlife (we chased a bear for about 50' at 60 km/h).  As the trail flattens out keep right at any major fork.  This will throw you out at a steep sand chute (very fast and dusty when dry).  Be prepared for huge grins at the end of this one.",
