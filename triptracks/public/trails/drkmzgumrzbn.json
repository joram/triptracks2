  "description": "The site of the launching of my first new kayak in 2005.  Recently I had the pleasure of helping my good friend Superscout launch his new kayak here.  The photos are from that day.  This is a typical CT leisurely lake paddle.  Well populated lake in places and elsewhere, not so much.  The launch is at the Northern tip, the lake is somewhat kidney shaped and the Southern end is highlighted by a dam seperating this body of water from Lower Bolton.  Boat traffic is light with an occasional fisherman or canoeist.  The parking lot at the launch was recently expanded and although it can only accomodate 10 cars or so, it is rarely full.",
  "directions": "The ramp is on Hatch Hill Road.  Hatch Hill is an Easterly turn off Bolton Road in Vernon.  You'll climb an excessively steep hill and then descend to the ramp.  It's only a one mile trip but make sure your brakes work.",
