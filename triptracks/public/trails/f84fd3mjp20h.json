  "description": "This isn't much of a hike but its a very neat feature to explore.  I had passed by the Tunnel Brook Cave many times without ever stopping.  I decided to explore it with my children.  We were all impressed by this place probably for different reasons.  Anyways, to make a long story short, the brook here tunnels through some sandstone for a good 50m or so.  It's got some small rapids in it but nothing to stop even children.  Although the depth can go up to about an adult knee length so you have to be prepared to get wet, or carry people that don't want to get wet...especially in late September where the water has return to a crisp degree. Basically you enter the tunnel on the side of the river and traverse it.  Once across there is a small trail that leads you to the top of the bluff and then back to your car.  The whole thing will not take a long tome but spending some time inside the tunnel is quite fun.",
  "directions": "Highway 4 North towards Folly Lake, the tunnel is right after the railroad bridge over the highway...you can't miss the bridge!",
