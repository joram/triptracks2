  "description": "Nice day/evening hike, if you are pressed for time. Nice hike along Buntzen lake trail, once you get to the Swan Falls trailhead, starts an ascent to the lookout point which is approximately 320 meters up. Falls are very nice, and nice views overlooking buntzen lake/surrounding areas.",
  "directions": "From Vancouver, drive east through Port Moody/Coquitlam, either from Highway 7a (from the Trans Canada) or from the Barnet Highway from Hastings Street and turn left on Ioco Road. Follow Ioco Road around the north shore of Burrard Inlet and follow the signs for Anmore and Buntzen Lake. At the gated Powerhouse Road, turn left into the parking lots. You begin hiking along the trail from the parking lot to the and, and up to the north beach, and from there keep following the powerhouse road about 10 minutes. You will see a small run-down shack on the right, and there is a sign marking the start of the trail.",
