  "description": "Midway is 'Mile 0' of the historic Kettle Valley Railway.  Travelling West of here will get you into what is normally called the heart of the KVR.  If you pedal/hike 150 km you'll get into the scenic Myra Canyon where all of the trestles have been rebuilt after the fire of '04.\nThere is also a great little museum of the KVR right on hiway 3 in Midway.  (I can't find their website but just Google (midway museum kvr) to get more info.",
  "directions": "Drive along Hwy 3 (the Crowsnest Highway) until you get to Midway - not so coincidentally about mid way across BC between Vancouver and Sparwood.  (And just West of Greenwood and about 3/4 hour West of Grand Forks)",
