  "description": "Trail to peak of Giant's Head Mountain in Summerland, BC. Trail is steep in places but no climbing is required. Length is 1.6 KM from trailhead to summit and elevation gain is approx 350 m (1050 ft). Time from base to top is approx 25-40 minutes and 20-30 minutes coming down, depending on ability of hikers. Not recommended for dogs (you are in direct sunlight all the way and no watering holes). In short, a good quick hike to get your heart rate up and with a beautiful view of the Okanagan at the top.There is also a road (see the map - very narrow, very steep, tight switchbacks) that takes you a good way up the mountain.  Having driven this on a separate occasion, I do not recommend driving this nicely paved but steep road to the upper parking lot -- there are no guard rails, it's steep the whole way (low gear preferred), and, the road can't accommodate two way traffic very well.The main trail (as per the GPS track to the right) is used by hikers and mountain bikers and the trail (old jeep road) bisects the switch-backing paved road.  Great views of Summerland and the lake.  You will see hikers / walkers taking the road up, and, lots of dog walkers.Bike shop / rentals: Freedom Bike Shop Accomodations: Summerland Resort",
