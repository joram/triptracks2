  "description": "St Peter's Island is a small land mass resting about 4-5 Km off shore in the Northumberland Strait. Although deesignated as an Island, it is connected by a long thin sand bar which may have been used to support a road.\r\n\r\nThe Area makes for a fun near-circumnavagation, (I think there is a sand bar which connects to the mainland) and as you get further behind the island, it offers an attractive vista of red cliffs and soft-wood stands. There is also an automated lighthouse around the back. \r\n\r\nSt. Peter's Island would make a great evening paddle, or an afternoon jaunt with plenty of opportunities for exploring sea and bird life on shore. If you keep a look out, you might even see the occasional seal.\r\n\r\nThe island also holds potential for kayak camping, but make sure you bring your own water, as I am doubtful of fresh water sources there. Remember, leave no trace. I don't know who owns the land.\r\n\r\nFinally, the tides in the area make for some shallow areas. In addition, the wind can pick up making for a more challenging go of things. Every time I've paddled the region, I've gone up against a gusty wind. Be prepared. A morning paddle would give you two bonuses; a low morning sun on the rock, and calm seas.",
  "directions": "From Charlottetown, head to Cornwall, and head toward Route 19 to get to Nine Mile Creek. Look for the Warf road on the shore side. There's a quaint fisherman's warf with a great launch site, and plenty of room to park.",
