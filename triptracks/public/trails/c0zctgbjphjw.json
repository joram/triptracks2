  "description": "Hiking trail; Views; Trail is maintained by BC Forest Service Recreation Program\r\n\r\nLENGTH/TIME: 1km/10mins\r\n\r\nHIGHLIGHTS: A scattered grove of old growth Douglas Fir among second growth forest. The ?Halfmoon Fir? is believed to be the biggest existing tree on the Sunshine Coast proper  (Gambier Island has a bigger one.) Its dimensions are 2.5m diameter, 8m circumference, and 65m tall.  (8?3??, 26 ?, 215? respectively.) The forest has a lush growth of ferns, mosses, and mushrooms.\r\n\r\nACCESS: Rough two-wheel drive. 9km north of Sechelt on Hwy 101, and 400m before Trout Lake, take the Halfmoon ? Carlson Forest Service Road, which leaves the highway at a small rock quarry on your right. Proceed exactly 2.8 km. On the main logging road, ignoring spurs to the left and right. A skid trail leaves the road on your right. Park at a wide spot immediately beyond the trail. The trail meanders for 600-700m through second growth forest. Then take a rutted skid road that climbs off to the left. In 200m you will see a very large Douglas Fir on your right and off to the left the Big Tree.\r\n\r\nTERRAIN: Wheelchair accessible\r\n\r\n\r",
