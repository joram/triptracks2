  "description": "Fox Mountain contains a well developed and well maintained network of freeride and cross country mountain bike trails. It allows for fairly fast shuttle runs with a variety of trail stunts to suit every rider. From steep gnar to smooth flowy single track to road gaps: Fox Mountain has enough to satisfy most riders.",
  "directions": "Fox Mountain Road is located on the north side of Williams Lake on the east side of Hwy  97. From here there are many options;\r\n1) 1st left on Eider, 1st right onto Gannet, 1st left onto Murre to the end. Here you will find a black diamond run called \"Hillbilly deluxe\" which winds back down to the base of Fox Mtn Rd.\r\n2) 1st right onto Mason to the end. This access point provides options to several trails, one of which is \"Dog Bone\", a steep switchback trail. Trails end at a multitude of locations, but the best bet for shuttles would be the Overlander or McDonalds.\r\n3) Continue on Fox Mtn Rd past Mason and take the next right (the road Y's) then take the next right to the end. This is probably the best place to start for multiple freeride options. Trails end at the Laughing Loon restaurant (also a good place for lunch!!!) where there is a large parking lot for shuttles.\r\nfootage of one of the drops\r\n\r\n\r\n\r",
