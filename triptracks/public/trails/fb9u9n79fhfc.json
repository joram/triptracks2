  "description": "This trail name cracks me up for some reason.  Gulch always makes me think of the Wild West, high desert, maybe Moab, Utah.  Caplin Gulch ... how do those little fishies hold them six-shooters anyways?\nAnyways, you'll be safe from gun totin' minnows on Caplin Gulch trail.  It is about 100 meters and 100 stairs from the road down to a very pleasant beach.   A very well maintained walkway takes you down and up the 25m of elevation change.\nTake a picnic, a book, your time, whatever, you'll probably have the beach to yourself and be able to *really* relax to the sound of the surf.  We were very fortunate with perfect blue skies while we were there as part of the trailpeak editors trip to Newfoundland and Labrador.",
  "directions": "Go to Sandy Cove. East on hiway 310 from the #1 about 60km South of Gander, past the top edge of Terra Nova National Park, through Eastport, and look for Sandy Cove Road just South of 310, follow it to the end, turn right at Tee and go about 1km and look for the trailhead on the beach side.",
