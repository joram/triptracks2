  "description": "A great place to visit while close to St. Johns, NL.  Up close and personal to Caribou, Martins, Minks, Eagles, Owls, Moose, you name it.  Best of all it is free admission, but I strongly suggest you give a donation if  you can so they can continue their work and displays.  There are about a dozen types of animals in different typs of enclosures as you wind along a 1 or 2km path.  The path is all boardwalk, so don't expect a woodland hike exactly, but it is the next best thing (even better thing if you're using a stroller for the kids or a wheelchair).  They have done a great job on making the walk fit in with the surroundings and it gives a very good vantage point of the residents.\n \nhttp://www.env.gov.nl.ca/env/snp/index.html",
