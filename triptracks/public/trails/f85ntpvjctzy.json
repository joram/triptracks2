  "description": "This was an area that I have wanted to explore from the sea, because of its red cliffs and rolling farm lands on shore.\r\n\r\nWe launched in at Kinloch and headed toward Crown point. The weather was perfect with slight winds, and sunny evening skies. \r\n\r\nA chop developed in the water, making for a fun roller-coaster ride as the bow rose and dipped into the waves.\r\n\r\nthe area is shallow, and we were paddling with the tide going out, so depths were around 4 feet or so. Needless to say, speed was not on the menu.\r\n\r\nOne real perk on this trip was the seals we came upon. Curious critters they were, peeking out with their heads out of the water, some within 20 feet from our hulls.",
  "directions": "From Charlottetown, cross the Hillsborough bridge, and take the Keppoch road to the right. When you reach the Kinloch road, turn right and head toward the little community space which serves as a great boat launch.",
