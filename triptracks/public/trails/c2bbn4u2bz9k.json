  "description": "This intermediate trail is a short sweet quick hit, with opportunities to huck for the huckers, berms, ramps, small drops and lots of flow. A great warm up before hitting the harder trails above, or a sweet little ride for those in a rush.  Just logged a short while ago, it's not as ascetically pleasing as it once was, but hey, the land does belong to a logging company, so be happy the trail is there to be ridden.\nRide up the skidder trail, going right past the exit to Hoots on your left, and the entrance to Shotgun on your right.  Pass a road on your right, and another on your left before coming to the entrance to Quickhit.  At the end of Quickhit, go right to get back to the skidder trail.\nMore Mission Woodlot trails can be found here \nsome cool helmet cam footage\n \nmore mountain biking videos can be found here",
