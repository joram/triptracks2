  "description": "The lower half of this trail is really smooth and flowy. THe upper is more swichbacks. When you finish the first section, turn left and follow teh old road untill you get to the lower part of the trail. You come out on woodland walk and then can go back that wa or take connector home",
  "directions": "GO to the gate on burke and take the 2nd left.  Go to the next fork in the trail and go straight, going up will take you to triple crown. Cross the creek  and continue on for a while. It tooke us a couple hours from the gate to get to the trailhead. It is on the left hand side of the trail, it goes into the bush and you see and old saw blade that says, \"sawblade, please ride, don't slide\". Sorry I can't give better directions, If you are going to try, go in the summer when the creeks you have to cross are not very deep and slower moving. Definatly take someone with you that has been there before as I know of one guy who tried to find it with his dog and the 5 hr death march almost killed the dog.",
