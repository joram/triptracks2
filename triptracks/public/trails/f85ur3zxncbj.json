  "description": "Ask the locals about a place called \"The Rock.\"  It's off the Sunrise Trail, just before Morristown, on your way from Antigonish. It's in the Cape George region. Following your way to Cribbons wharf, park at a gravel patch before the road turns sharp to the wharf.\r\n\r\nA foot path leads you down to the water. Ignore the trespassing signage, even the home owner turns a blind eye to water seekers. \"Young Folks\" go there to swim and jump off the rocks into the ocean. I had to check it out. Watch your step!\r\n\r\nWhen I found the spot, it was all they said, and even more. I guess not many folks here know the sport of bouldering, but if you're in need of a fix, there's an afternoon's playground at \"The Rocks\"\r\n\r\nCrack Harvest V3\r\n\r\n\r\nShannon Burt\r\nEast Coast Editor\r",
