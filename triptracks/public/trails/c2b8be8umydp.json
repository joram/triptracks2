  "description": "This is a great hike that is every bit as good a cardio workout as the Grouse Grind, but far more scenic (and less crowded). I can't figure out why more people don't do it. To get to the trail-head, take the Lynn Canyon exit just off the Upper Levels Highway in North Vancouver. Turn right onto Lynn Valley Road past the turn-off to Lynn Canyon Park (you have to go past it). Follow the GVRD signs into Lynn Headwaters Regional Park. Once you walk into the park, there should be a board with trail maps and any park warnings in effect.Walk a little further and cross the wooden bridge off to the right (be sure to check out how clean and refreshing that raging water is!). Then, follow the Lynn Loop trail (you have to walk up a gravel road for a short way first) and a little while later the Lynn Peak Trail will bear off to the right (there is a little bit of climbing involved before you get there). For the first 45 minutes to an hour it's pretty steep going. The first lookout offers a great view of Seymour Mountain. Once you have reached the first lookout, the really hard work is done (but not completely). From that point, you head into some fantastic old growth forest (I believe it's even called the Enchanted Forest). It is simply breathtaking and the terrain rises and falls quite gently (so your heart can slow down a bit from the big climb you just did!). This part of the hike is really fun as terrain varies quite a bit from the previous part. The trail is really well maintained and marked so it's pretty tough to get lost.There are a few more nice lookouts along the way, but once you actually get to Lynn Peak, the view is breathtaking (Burrard Inlet and the Seymour Demonstration Forest). At this point you have worked hard to get here so take a load off and have some lunch (you deserve it) - plus this just happens to be a great place for lunch. Total elevation at the top is about 930 meters.To get back, just re-trace your steps back down the trail - and watch those knees coming down! Round trip takes about 3 - 3.5 hours (including a break at the top).",
