  "description": "The hike takes you on the outskirts of the park through some lovely connecting trails which are well marked. However, you do need to pay attention  when you come across the names of the different trailheads that can disorientate you on the direction of the trail in means since there are so many trailheads in the park that branch off.",
  "directions": "Take Pat Bay Hwy from Victoria until you come to Mt Newton X Road, turn left on the lights, continue until you come to W Saanich Road intersection and hang a right. Not to far up about 3 minutes you will come to Alec Road - turn right again and head almost to the end. There will be areas for you to pull in to park the car. Look out for the trailhead at the beginning of the park. It is well marked.",
