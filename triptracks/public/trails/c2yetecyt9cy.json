  "description": "April 5th, 2008A great peak for an early season scramble... Chinook winds at this junction are somewhat violent and have a way of blasting away any lingering snow off the ridge!_____________________________Thunder Mountain is located in an area known as 'The Gap' and is part of the Livingston Range. The Gap is aptly named, as there literally a 'gap' in the Livingston Ridge at this junction that allows the Oldman River to wind its way through on its voyage east.There are are a couple of ridges that lead to the summit of Thunder Mountain. We ascended from the western ridge, which required losing a good amount of elevation off a false summit. Once on the ridge, it would be a pleasant ridge walk - however it was crazy windy on our summit day! Some of my hiking companions had previously climbed Thunder by the interconnecting east ridge, so we did a loop and descended by the other ridge and the drivers ended up getting a lift back to the cars (it would have been a 30 minute walk back to the cars along the road). The descent required some careful route finding as it is easy to get cliffed out on the southern ridge.",
  "directions": "Going north up Hwy. 22, turn at Maycroft just before crossing the Oldman River and follow the road west (South side of the Oldman River). Winding your way up the road along the river, pass through the gap... just BEFORE the next river crossing there is a rough parking area. We parked here and backtracked back up the road a couple of minutes in order to access a slope of reasonable steepness to start the climb towards Thunder.",
