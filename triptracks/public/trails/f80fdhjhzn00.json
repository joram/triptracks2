  "description": "This trail is well used by local hikers and by rock climbers who like to do beginner's training at the top. It is a bit rocky though and except for a couple of times it is a constant uphill battle :-> If you aren't in shape, like me, it may be a bit of a struggle.When you get to the top take in the panoramic view. There is usually a nice breeze at the top so if the bugs were eating you alive on the climb up you may get to cool off and get a bit of peace. Good luck. The elevation at the top is 713ft.",
  "directions": "When arriving in Welsford on the #7 take the 101 North. Go past Burton Lane and under the overpass then take the next  right to a parking area. Immediately look up to your right, in the North West corner, you will see 8ft wide trail heading up into the woods. Start up the trail.",
