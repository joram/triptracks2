  "description": "This trail is part of the Fiddle Pass trail that takes you from the Whitehorse Recreational Camping trailhead right through to Miette Hotsprings, if you so choose. Choose the trail to Whitehorse Falls for a great one day hike, 7 hours round trip.",
  "directions": "Head west from Hinton, Alberta and turn south on Highway 40. Travel the pavement 1/2 an hour to Cadomin. Well, there is still some gravel. Pass through the Hamlet Cadomin and continue to the Whitehorse Recreation area staging area. There is some camping here, mostly reserved for those using horses, but I don't think it is highly used. We only had two Wildlife Officers getting ready to take some supplies to their Warden cabin, otherwise no horses on the trail at all.",
