  "description": "Leaving from the dock at Maple Bay, this 14.5 kilometre round trip to Burgoyne Bay on the west side of Saltspring Island takes you through some of the most beautiful scenery in the Gulf Islands.\r\n\r\nLeaving Maple Bay, skirt around Paddy Mile Stone and Octopus Point, then head straight across Samsun Narrows and into Burgoyne Bay. The bay offers fantastic views of Mount Maxwell to the north, a close up view of logging operations, and booming yards.\r\n\r\nWhile the shoreline in Burgoyne Bay is rocky and barnacle encrusted, there is a government wharf at the east end of the bay. The bay can also be reached by road from the Fulford Harbour ferry terminal. \r\n There is GPS data attached to this trail (see \"download GPS\"), which if loaded into your GPS can help you find route points.",
  "directions": "In Duncan, Trans Canada Highway to Wharncliff Road, exit onto Maple Bay Road.\r\n\r\nUTM 10U  4554061E  54068265N\r",
