  "description": "Well Defined trail. Rocky and rooty . Good view of sea and swamps. Situated next to Spednic Lake which is good for canoeing and fishing.\r\nCamp sites availabe by the lakes. Minimal services - there are a number of outhouses but no running water.\r\nCamping is on first come first serve basis - no reservations. Nice idyllic location for a quiet camping vacation.",
  "directions": "From Fredericton take Trans Canada Highway towards Edmunstan. Go about 30 KM and take exit 3 towards St. Stephens. - You are now on Highway 3 south. At Thomaston Corner take Highway  4.  Drive through town of McAdam (note the historic Railway station there - worth a look). After about 4.5 km turn left to highway 630 - this will become a gravel road soon. The sign to Spednick Lake Provincial park appears. The Trail is there.\r\nGPX file to get there attached.",
