  "description": "Red Rock Coulee Natural Area is a very unique part of southeast Alberta. Huge red boulders litter the landscape near the parking lot. The red boulders are thought to be 'concretions' that have formed over time, rather than erratics deposited by glacier action.\nFurther afield, the coulee badlands looks like a scene from a spaghetti Western. The badlands can be explored for as little as a few minutes or as long as several hours, however a hiker chooses. There are informal trails following the coulee bottom, and there are a few different coulees that can be explored. The edge of the park area is denoted by cattle fences at the area perimeter.\nNote: We did not see too much wildlife, other than a small herd of mule deer far off in the distance... but supposedly, this is pretty good rattlesnake country.",
  "directions": "Follow highway three towards Seven Persons and take the turnoff south. From Lethbridge, the turnoff is just past Seven Person.",
