  "description": "This trail is my all time favourite trail, as well as the favourite of everybody I've ridden it with.  It's got 4000 vertical feet of steeps, log rides, airs, ladders, skinnies and flowy high speed fun.  Great scenery, this mostly downhill  trail, with a a bit of freeride on the side, is definitely a trail for expert riders.\nDirections\nTake Highway 6 out of Kaslo towards New Denver for 3km looking for Mount Buchanan forestry road on your right.  The drive up this active logging road is about 45 minutes long and should only be driven with vehicles with a lot of clearance.  Take the road to the lookout (all the way to the top) to the parking spot and ride the trail behind the outhouse all the way to the bottom.  When you come out of the trail go right to the gravel pits.  Hike uphill from the pits then take the road all the way back into town.",
