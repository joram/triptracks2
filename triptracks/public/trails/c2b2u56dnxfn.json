  "description": "Proceed through Cypress Falls Park, crossing Cypress creek in the process. After about 20 minutes leave park and turn left onto paved service road. Shortly after, just before BC Hydro substation, turn right onto old logging road and continue uphill. Turn left onto Trans Canada Trail (direction Horseshoe Bay - West) just before reaching Cypress Park Road. Remain on TCT, go under power line, later follow main power line right of way for short time, drop down to and cross Cypress Creek below downhill ski area, climb opposite hill side to high point of about 840m. Still remaining on TCT (old logging road) pass viewpoint with nice bench, new outhouse, then drop down into Cypress Creek valley onto recently rebuilt gravel service road. Leave the TCT which proceeds right by staying straight on this road until crossing Cypress Creek again and returning to the BC Hydro substation. Then retrace steps through Cypress Falls Park to car parking area. Total elevation gain about 600m.",
  "directions": "Take Upper Levels Hwy to Exit 4. Turn right on Woodgreen Drive, continue up about 3 blocks. Turn right at sign to Cypress Falls Park. Park in lot (no fee at present)",
