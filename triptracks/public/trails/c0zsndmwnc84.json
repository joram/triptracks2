  "description": "The trail starts off at N49\u00b0 56.424' W124\u00b0 9.847' from a old logging road spur which can be reached by walking, bike, motorcycle or ATV.  The road was once accessible by four wheel drive but in recent years has been washed out in places.  Trail is well marked with tape, steep in parts, snow in some areas, the snow stays all year but is easy to get around. \nTrip times depends on how close you can get to the start of the trail from East Branch, the hike can easily be done in three four hours which gives you lots of time to explore and enjoy the view.",
