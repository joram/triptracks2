  "description": "The first hike I ever took on MDI and still one of my favorites.  The first time we went we took one of those Ranger led interpretive hikes.  I would highly recommend that.  The Rangers point out things you would never see on your own and you should really know the history of the island, the devastating fire that consumed it and some of the geology before you do much exploring on your own.  I prefer to start at the Gorham trailhead and loop up and over the Beehive and walk back on the road.  There's not as much parking as at Sandy Beach but there isn't as much competition for it either.  The hike is much harder if you start at The Beehive as the ascent up that little hill is by steel rung ladders, sunk into the rock face.  I prefer to keep my feet on solid ground, but I have done it both ways.  Before you start, take a look at The Beehive from Sandy Beach, you'll appreciate your accomplishment all the more while at the top.",
  "directions": "On the Acadia Park Loop Road, South of Thunderhole and North of Otter Point.  Walkable from either location as well.",
