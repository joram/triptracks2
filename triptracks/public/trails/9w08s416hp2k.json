  "description": "Bartlett Lake about 45 minutes north of Phoenix, AZ. It has a boatable surface area of some 2,815 acres.  It is a good size lake, one of the largest in the area.  It offers camping and fishing as well as boating.I paddled some 12.6 miles in 5 hours.  It is a great lake to kayak especially if you can go during the week when there are not many boaters on the lake.  I put in at the main launch site by the marina but you can turn north just before the main entrance and launch at Rattlesnake cove.For kayak rentals, SUP, and guided hiking options in the area check out Arizona Outback Adventures.",
  "directions": "Go to Carefree and look for the signs going east to the lake approximately 23 miles.",
