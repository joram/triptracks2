  "description": "NTS Map: 083A05This short dirt trail provides mulitiple access points to Lacombe Lake. This is not the most exciting trail but is more remote than the trails in Red Deer. You might be joined by two friendly dogs that live near the trail head. If the GPS data doesn't help you find your way the dogs will.",
  "directions": "Go north 2A from Red Deer. From 2A North go through Blackfalds until the Lakeside/Sargent sign. Turn left onto the dirt road and look for the Tipi Village Campgroud sign and trun right. Look for the Lacombe Lake Natural Area sign. To the right you will find a gate and the trail head.  \r",
