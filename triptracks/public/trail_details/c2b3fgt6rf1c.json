  "description": "An alternative route up Leading Peak on Anvil Island via East Creek which does not pass through the Bible camp. It is a 5.1 km paddle to East Creek bay from Porteau Cove. This is the preferred approach for paddlers and provides more direct access to the summit than the trail from the south side. The trail is flagged with pink ribbons and starts directly west of the landing beach.WARNING: These waters can be lethal. It can get very windy, rough, with tide & current & present an exposure (cold) risk. Paddlers should be fully prepared for immersion in cold water and have sufficient rescue and communication gear should a return trip not be possible due to wind and weather.",
