  "description": "I was looking for a mountain terrain challenge for a change from the runs I had been doing. This trail fit the bill.  I met some good companions who both biked and ran.  There is no chance of getting lost as the circuitous route does not take you too far from the parking ares.",
  "directions": "head north out of Ft. St. John on 100 st. Go 4 km to Cecil Lake road. Head east for 9.5 km.",
