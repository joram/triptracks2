  "description": "The first 300m of the trail allows access to a nice beach which can be enjoyed by all ages.  You should reach the second old bridge in approximately 1/2 hour.  There are many spots to get to the beach for picnics or beachcombing. There are six alternate access trails (marked as ?cut-down/cut-up?), which provide opportunities to shorten the hike. \nThe Douglas Channel Trail upgrade project during the summer of 2000 significantly improved approximately 3/5?s (3.5 km) of the trail. The remaining 2/5?s (2.5 km) of the trail was brushed out and marked so that it could be followed but it requires more work to bring it up to the same standard as the first part of the trail.  \nThe Kitimat Chamber of Commerce and Alcan Primary Metal Group ? British Columbia are no longer managing this area as a recreation trail. Unsafe and dangerous conditions may exist. Proceed at your own risk.",
  "directions": "Past Rio Tinto Alcan, turn Right on the logging road.  Turn left after 3 KM.  Go down, There is an open space, the trail start there and finish at the end of North Cove Trail.",
