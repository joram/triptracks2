  "description": "This area deserves a seperate description because it is quite different to the normal summer hiking trail. You would not want to attempt using the steep avalanche prone hiking route for snow sports!The route heads up behind the Hilda Creek Hostel.The same spectacular sights await, without the crowds.Of course, be avalanche aware!",
  "directions": "While Parker Ridge is located in northern Banff National Park, the closest town is actually Jasper. Drive south of Jasper on Hwy 93 for 113km to the parking lot on the left side of the road. The parking lot is used for the Hilda Creek Hostel. Or, go north 181km from Banff, 121km from Lake Louise on Hwys #1 the Trans-Canada & 93 the Icefields Parkway. Coming from either direction the drive is one of the most scenic in the world and worth the trip all by itself.",
