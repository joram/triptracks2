It varies a bit each year as landowners change their minds and the weather affects things.\r\rI've entered in the past but for the last 20 years have instead worked on the safety team patrolling and sweeping the sections.\r\rFor more details (and to sign up if you want) look here  http://www.csm-mcs.com/",
