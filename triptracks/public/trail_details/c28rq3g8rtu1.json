  "description": "The mouth of the Fraser has a slow current and can be paddled in both directions.  The Islands in Ladner Marsh are off limits to motor boats and make for a nice paddle, especially considering how close it is to  the city.  The hazards include tides and motor boats (not everyone follows the rules)",
  "directions": "There are a number of places to put-in.  We have launched from the boat launch at the end of Ferry Road in Ladner, and the boat launch at the end of Savage Road on Westham Island, but there are plenty of other spots as well.",
