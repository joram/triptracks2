  "description": "This is one of the premier spot for swimming in the summer.  The village of the Falls bears well its name.  the Waugh river has carved a gorge in the middle of the village which is uite spectacular.  the falls are not overly tall but the high bliuffs surrounding the gorge are amazing.  there is also the remains of an old power plant to explore.",
  "directions": "Highway 311 and turn on Power House Rd and park at the turn around at the end and follow the trails towards the river.",
