  "description": "Some of the easiest and most interesting trails on the Big Island of Hawaii are \rat the resorts. The Hilton resort at Waikoloa has beach trials and parts of the \rKings trail which are all accessible to any one, you don't have to be staying at \rthe resort.\r\rThere is section with petroglyphs, several sections with ponds. The Mauna Lani \rresort has Fish ponds where you can see a variety of tropical fish.\r\rThe beach trail goes from the Waikoloa resort to the Mauna Lani resort with \rloops are the ponds available.\r\rSome sections of the trail are lava and not easy walking.\r\rThe other feature of these trails is you can plan to stop for food or tropical \rrefreshments at one of the resort restaurants along sections of the trail",
  "directions": "From Highway 19 take the road to Waikoloa or Mauna Lani, there is parking \ravailable at both resorts. Waikoloa gets you closer to the beach.",
