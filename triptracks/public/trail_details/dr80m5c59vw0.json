  "description": "This is nice classic single track with good elevation changes but it's not too difficult.\r\rWe spent the morning here after a big day at Holiday Valley the day before. It was fun exploring around in here. We picked up a trail map from the local bike store in Ellicotville but the track log pretty much cover everything here.\r\r",
  "directions": "Take the 219 south of of Ellicotville and turn east on Hwy 98. Watch for Golden Hill Rd on your right and follow it to the parking area near the top of the hill.",
