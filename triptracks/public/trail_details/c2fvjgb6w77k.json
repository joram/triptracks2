  "directions": "Get onto westside road and head past bear creek to Lamly Road which will be on your left hand side.Head up there for about 15km youll bass Burnco Rock products site on your right.... after that you see a road going up to your right you want to take that one. Be carefull though as there are a few you want the one just before the sign that says Bear lake Road  straight ahead. I believe is all says Terrance Lake or Terrance Lake Road. After this you'll be on active logging roads and mile markers. Youll go about 10 km up this road till you come to Terrace Lake, second turn off on your right  is  road going to your right again. It should have small pink sign that says Christie Falls on it.Head up this road for about 3.6 km off too your left there should be another sign for christie falls head down this one all the way to the end there is a small camp/parking area and the trail head is right in front of you.",
