  "description": "The trail starts at  Deep Cove. You first reach the Quarry Rock and after you continue through the Baden Powell trail to get to Lynn Valley. After that, you take the trail that leads to Lynn Peak. From Deep Cove to Lynn Valley is almost flat and the trail to Lynn peak is steeper. It makes a for a longer hike by combining these routes (Baden Powell after Quarry Rock).",
