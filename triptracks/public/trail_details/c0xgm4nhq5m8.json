  "description": "Nice cross-country trails, no big hucks or drops. This is an old logging site so there are tons of trails. Also used by motocross riders so be aware. If you can pace them in the grind you will get many high-fives :)",
  "directions": "Head west on Sooke road, go past Sooke about 2km. Approx. 300m after the road turns north there will be a gravel pit on the left and some dirt pullouts on the right. You can huck & pump the pit or follow the trails on the right.",
