  "description": "A simple trail from a \"parking lot\" at the end of a logging trail down to Meditation Lake. The spruce forest at the end of the trail is quite beautiful. For an extra challenge you can climb up onto the canadian shield and follow it to reach another point further up the lake.",
  "directions": "Highway 307 to Highway 309. Head north towards Big Whiteshell Lake. You should see a sign for Meditation lake on the left side the road. If you see the sign for Lone Island lake you have gone too far.",
