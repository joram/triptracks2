  "description": "Beautiful hike, suitable for family. Lots of diversity: Beaver dam, nice forest, beautiful mature trees, picture perfect lake. Trail is partly asphalted at the beginning and then good quality wide dirt trail. Interesting sites along the way (mica mine shaft). Toilets at half-way.",
