  "description": "This is a non trail trail to a river which has two main waterfalls.   I have only travelled to the downstream waterfall in winter via soldier Lakwe.  the route I am posting today is via the woodlands to the upper fall.  Once you are at the upper fall it's a mere 600m of bushwacking to the downstream fallThe woods you will traverse are a mixture of logged area and stunted forest due to the poor drainage of this area.  Prepare for some thhick brush from time to time and then some area whuich are more open but boggy.",
