  "description": "The easiest and most direct route from Whistler Village is as follows: \n- Purchase a 1-way backcountry lift ticket for $40; \n- Take the Whistler Village Gondola to the Roundhouse Lodge and descend to Harmony Express Chairlift; \n- Take the Harmony Express Chairlift to the summit of Little Whistler Peak; \n- Traverse south-eastward past Piccolo Summit to Flute Summit (edge of Garibaldi Provincial Park); \n- Continue onwards past Oboe Summit and descend to Singing Pass; \n- From Singing Pass wend your way back up to Singing Pass-Fissile Peak flank; \n- Bear north-east and traverse down and across western shoreline of Russet Lake to hut at north end.\nTravel time for me in deep winter with full pack and fair conditions is approximately 3.5 hrs from top of Harmony Express Chairlift to hut.  Be very mindful of potential avalanche conditions around Singing Pass area and western slope above Russet Lake.\n \nThe Himmelsback Hut is primitive, but beats a tent in winter conditions.",
