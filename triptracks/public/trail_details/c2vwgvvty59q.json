  "description": "Stiff height gain but on switch back trail. Summit pinnacle is best negoatirated by traversing under the peak to gain the right hand skyline. The left hand skyline approach is not for the faint hearted in winter as there is some exposure, but the lookers right is just steep scree.",
  "directions": "Follow route to Chisel Peak. Kootenay Number 3 road about 10 minutes south of Invermere Cross roads (Tim Hortons/Esso). Road is in pretty bad shape, high clearance recommended. Park where road turns sharply right at large boulder on left  turn.",
