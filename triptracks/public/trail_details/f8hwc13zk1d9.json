  "description": "A short hike....downhill to the falls.  they are also called Piper's Glen Falls and are irresistible.  Once you've gone there once you will want to go again and again.  The downhill part os short but very steep.  Ropes have been installed to help you down the mature hardwood forest.  In front of the falls is a large flat area where you can relax and even camp!  The falls themselves are at least 60ft high and separated into three main tiers.",
  "directions": "In upper Margaree (North of L Ainslie) turn on Egpt Rd and then right on Piper's Glen Rd.  Continue until you see flagging tape and maybe a sign on your right.",
